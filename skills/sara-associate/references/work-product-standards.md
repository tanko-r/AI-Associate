# Work Product Standards by Document Type

## General Standards

All documents Sara produces follow these baseline standards:

- **Clean prose** — no unnecessary legalese, no filler, no throat-clearing paragraphs
- **Active voice** — prefer "the Landlord shall deliver" over "delivery shall be made by the Landlord"
- **Defined terms** — capitalize and use consistently; define on first use or in a definitions section
- **Parallel structure** — lists and enumerated provisions use consistent grammatical form
- **Precision** — every sentence says exactly what it means; ambiguity is a defect

## Memoranda

### Internal Research Memo

**Structure:**
1. **Header block** — To, From (Sara), Date, Re
2. **Question Presented** — specific legal question in one sentence
3. **Short Answer** — 2-4 sentence direct answer
4. **Factual Background** — relevant facts, stated neutrally
5. **Analysis** — IRAC structure (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) for each sub-issue
6. **Conclusion** — summary of analysis with recommendation

**Standards:**
- State the question precisely — a well-framed question is half the answer
- Short answer should be direct: "Yes, because..." or "No, because..." not "It depends"
- Analysis should address counterarguments
- Cite every legal proposition
- Distinguish binding from persuasive authority
- Note uncertainty honestly — "the law is unsettled" when it is

### Client-Facing Memo

**Structure:**
1. **Header block** — To (client), From (firm), Date, Re
2. **Executive Summary** — key takeaways in 3-5 bullet points
3. **Background** — factual and legal context the client needs
4. **Analysis** — organized by issue, written for a sophisticated non-lawyer
5. **Recommendations** — specific, actionable next steps
6. **Risk Assessment** — material risks with likelihood and impact

**Standards:**
- Write for a sophisticated businessperson, not a judge
- Lead with the answer, then explain
- Minimize citations in the body; use footnotes if needed
- Focus on practical implications, not legal theory
- Include a clear recommendation — clients want advice, not just analysis
- Flag what requires a business decision vs. a legal one

## Agreements

### Contract Drafting

**Structure:**
1. **Preamble** — parties, date, defined short names
2. **Recitals** — background and purpose (WHEREAS clauses or plain-English introduction)
3. **Definitions** — if more than 5 defined terms, use a separate section
4. **Operative provisions** — the deal terms, organized logically
5. **Representations and warranties** — if applicable
6. **Covenants** — ongoing obligations
7. **Conditions** — to closing or performance
8. **Indemnification** — if applicable
9. **Termination** — how and when the agreement ends
10. **General provisions** — governing law, dispute resolution, notices, amendments, severability, entire agreement, counterparts
11. **Signature blocks**

**Standards:**
- Use "shall" for obligations, "will" for future facts, "may" for permissions
- Define terms precisely — bracket [DEFINED TERM] any term needing client input
- Cross-reference correctly — section numbers, defined terms
- Draft symmetrically where appropriate — if one party has a right, consider whether the other should too
- Include operative dates and deadlines
- Use "including, without limitation" or "including but not limited to" consistently (pick one)
- Number sections and subsections consistently

### Contract Amendments

**Standards:**
- Reference the original agreement precisely (title, date, parties)
- Use "hereby amended" language
- Restate the provision being amended, then state the amendment
- Include a confirmation that all other terms remain in effect
- Match the style and defined terms of the original agreement

## Correspondence

### Draft Emails

**Structure:**
1. **Subject line** — clear, specific
2. **Salutation** — appropriate formality level
3. **Purpose** — first sentence states why you're writing
4. **Body** — organized, concise
5. **Action items** — specific asks or next steps, bolded or bulleted
6. **Close** — professional sign-off

**Standards:**
- Match the tone to the recipient and relationship
- One email, one purpose — don't bury asks
- Put the ask or action item early, not at the end
- Be specific about deadlines: "by Friday, February 20" not "soon"
- For sensitive topics, note that this is a draft for partner review

### Draft Letters

**Structure:**
1. **Letterhead placeholder** — [FIRM LETTERHEAD]
2. **Date and addressee**
3. **Re line** — matter reference
4. **Body** — formal, precise
5. **Signature block** — partner name (Sara notes who should sign)

**Standards:**
- More formal than email — complete sentences, no contractions
- Reference relevant agreements, statutes, or prior correspondence by date
- State the firm's position clearly
- Include specific demands, deadlines, or next steps
- Note privileged/confidential status if applicable

## Briefs and Motions

### Motion Brief

**Structure:**
1. **Caption** — court, case number, parties
2. **Introduction** — 1-2 paragraphs framing the issue and relief sought
3. **Statement of Facts** — relevant facts with record citations
4. **Legal Standard** — applicable standard of review
5. **Argument** — organized under descriptive point headings
6. **Conclusion** — specific relief requested

**Standards:**
- Point headings should be complete sentences that state the conclusion
- Lead with strongest argument
- Address and distinguish adverse authority — don't ignore it
- Cite the record for every factual assertion
- Use parentheticals for case citations to show relevance
- Comply with applicable court rules (page limits, formatting, filing requirements)
- Note: Sara will flag court-specific rules she's aware of and ask about any she's not sure about

## Summaries and Analyses

### Due Diligence Summary

**Structure:**
1. **Overview** — what was reviewed, scope of review
2. **Key Findings** — material issues, organized by category
3. **Risk Matrix** — severity and likelihood for each finding
4. **Detailed Findings** — section-by-section analysis
5. **Recommendations** — suggested actions for each material finding

### Issue Spotting / Risk Assessment

**Structure:**
1. **Executive Summary** — top 3-5 issues
2. **Issues by Category** — organized by risk level or subject matter
3. **For each issue:**
   - Description of the issue
   - Why it matters (commercial impact)
   - Likelihood and severity
   - Recommended action
4. **Next Steps** — prioritized action items

**Standards:**
- Rank issues by materiality — don't bury the important ones
- Distinguish legal risk from business risk
- Be specific about probability: "likely," "possible," "remote" with basis
- Provide actionable recommendations, not just issue identification
