# RE PSA Review Checklist

> **Usage:** Sara loads this file during Step 3 (framework building) of a PSA review. Read the category list first, then load categories matching the document's structure from the Step 2 initial read. Skip categories that clearly do not apply to the transaction.
>
> **Populating this file:** Replace `[TODO: ...]` placeholders with firm-specific content as deals are completed. Each placeholder describes what to add. Search for `[TODO` to find all placeholders.
>
> **Representation:** Review points are neutral -- they tell Sara what to look for regardless of which side she represents. Key Risks tables have separate Buyer Perspective and Seller Perspective columns -- Sara reads the column matching her current representation.

## 1. Definitions & Key Defined Terms [Common]

### Review Points

- [ ] **Catalog all defined terms** -- Extract every defined term and its definition. Verify consistent capitalization throughout the document. Cross-check that every capitalized term in the body has a corresponding definition.

- [ ] **Check "Knowledge" definition** -- How is the knowledge qualifier defined? Is it "actual knowledge" only, or does it include "constructive knowledge" or "knowledge after due inquiry"? Who are the named knowledge parties? Are they the right people (decision-makers with day-to-day property operations knowledge, not just principals)?
  - See: market-standards.md > 1. Definitions & Key Defined Terms > Knowledge Qualifier
  - [TODO: Add firm's standard position on knowledge qualifier scope for institutional sellers vs smaller operators]

- [ ] **Check "Material Adverse Effect" or "Material Adverse Change" definition** -- Does the MAE/MAC definition exist? What are the carve-outs (industry-wide changes, general economic conditions, pandemic, acts of God)? Is there a "disproportionate impact" qualifier? Does it apply only post-study-period changes?
  - See: market-standards.md > 1. Definitions & Key Defined Terms > MAE/MAC

- [ ] **Check "Permitted Exceptions" definition** -- What title exceptions are pre-approved as permitted? Is the definition overly broad (e.g., permitting any exception existing as of the effective date)? Does it include standard utility easements, rights of tenants, and recorded restrictions? Are specific exceptions itemized or defined by reference?
  - [TODO: Add firm's standard position on permitted exceptions scope for different deal types]

- [ ] **Check "Property" definition scope** -- Does the definition include personal property, intangible property (contract rights, permits, entitlements, intellectual property), leases, and warranties in addition to the real property (land + improvements)? Are plans, surveys, and software included?

- [ ] **Verify "Business Day" definition** -- Does the definition exclude specific holidays? Is it consistent with the governing law jurisdiction? Does it include or exclude banking holidays?

- [ ] **Check "Seller Parties" or exculpation definition** -- Does the definition of protected parties extend beyond the seller entity to include officers, directors, shareholders, members, managers, agents, and affiliates? How broad is the exculpation scope?

- [ ] **Verify "Closing Date" definition** -- Is it a date certain or formula-based? Are there extension rights? What triggers extension? Is there an outside date?

- [ ] **Check "Contracts" definition** -- Does it capture all service, maintenance, management, and vendor agreements? Are "Material Contracts" separately defined with a termination-notice or dollar threshold?

- [ ] **Verify "Leases" definition** -- Does it include all occupancy agreements, amendments, side letters, and guarantees? Is a lease schedule attached? Does the schedule include rent commencement, expiration, options, and security deposits?

- [ ] **Check "Hazardous Materials" / environmental definitions** -- Does the definition reference CERCLA, RCRA, and state environmental statutes? Is it broad enough to capture all applicable substances including asbestos, lead paint, mold, and PFAS?

- [ ] **Check "Tenant" and "Major Tenant" definitions** -- Are Major Tenants defined by square footage threshold or by name? Does the Major Tenant list match the actual significant tenants?

- [ ] **Verify currency and amount definitions** -- Are deposit amounts, caps, thresholds, and other dollar amounts clearly stated? Are there defined escalation or adjustment mechanisms?

### Key Risks

| Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Narrow knowledge qualifier (actual knowledge only, limited named parties) | High -- seller can disclaim knowledge of property defects known to property managers but not named parties | Favorable -- limits exposure from property-level issues not known to principals |
| No MAE/MAC definition | Medium -- buyer loses termination right for material adverse changes between signing and closing | Favorable -- eliminates buyer walk-away right for intervening events |
| Overly broad Permitted Exceptions | High -- buyer may take title subject to unknown or unacceptable encumbrances | Favorable -- reduces title cure obligations and closing risk |
| Narrow Property definition (excludes intangibles, personal property) | Medium -- buyer may not receive all assets needed to operate the property | Low -- seller retains flexibility on ancillary assets |
| Exculpation extends to all Seller Parties including agents | High -- effectively eliminates recourse for misrepresentation by property managers or brokers | Favorable -- insulates principals and related parties from post-closing claims |
| [TODO: Add additional risks from firm experience] | | |

---

## 2. Property Description & Conveyance [Common]

### Review Points

- [ ] **Verify legal description** -- Is a metes and bounds or lot-and-block legal description attached as an exhibit? Does it match the title commitment and survey? Confirm the street address is included for identification.

- [ ] **Check real property scope** -- Does the conveyance include all land, buildings, structures, improvements, and fixtures? Are appurtenant rights included (easements, air rights, development rights, rights to the centerline of adjacent streets)?

- [ ] **Verify personal property inclusion** -- Are fixtures, equipment, machinery, and other tangible personal property included in the sale? Is there a specific list or schedule of included personal property? Are tenant-owned items excluded?

- [ ] **Check intangible property inclusion** -- Does the conveyance include contract rights, permits, certificates of occupancy, land use approvals, zoning variances, warranties, guarantees, plans, surveys, software, websites, trademarks, trade names, and telephone numbers associated with the property?

- [ ] **Verify lease assignment** -- Are all leases, occupancy agreements, amendments, and lease guarantees included in the conveyance? Is a lease schedule attached?

- [ ] **Check contract assignment** -- Are service contracts, management agreements, and vendor contracts included? Does the buyer have the right to select which contracts to assume vs terminate?

- [ ] **Verify exclusions** -- Are any specific items excluded from the sale? Are tenant-owned or third-party-owned items properly excluded? Are items being removed by the seller identified?

- [ ] **Check entitlements and approvals** -- Are transferable permits, approvals, and entitlements included? Are there any non-transferable entitlements that need re-application?

### Key Risks

| Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Legal description does not match survey or title | High -- boundary disputes, encroachment issues, or gap/gore problems post-closing | High -- potential title claim or failure to convey |
| Personal property excluded or not specified | Medium -- buyer may not receive equipment, fixtures, or systems needed to operate | Low -- seller retains flexibility |
| Intangible property rights not transferred | Medium -- buyer loses access to permits, plans, warranties, or trade names | Low -- seller retains flexibility |
| No right to select which contracts to assume | Medium -- buyer stuck with unfavorable vendor agreements | Favorable -- ensures continuity of property services |
| [TODO: Add additional risks from firm experience] | | |

---

## 3. Purchase Price & Deposit Mechanics [Common]

### Review Points

- [ ] **Verify purchase price** -- Is the purchase price correctly stated? Are there any price adjustment mechanisms (rent roll adjustments, working capital adjustments, post-closing prorations)?

- [ ] **Check deposit structure** -- Is the deposit soft (refundable) through the DD period, or does it go hard immediately? What event triggers the deposit going hard? Is there a "Restricted Period" before the DD expiration where the deposit becomes at risk?
  - See: market-standards.md > 3. Purchase Price & Deposit Mechanics > Deposit Structure
  - [TODO: Add firm's standard position on deposit timing for institutional deals]

- [ ] **Verify deposit amount** -- Is the deposit amount reasonable for this transaction size and type? Is there an additional deposit required at the end of the DD period? What is the additional deposit amount and timing?
  - See: market-standards.md > 3. Purchase Price & Deposit Mechanics > Deposit Amount

- [ ] **Check interest on deposit** -- Who receives interest earned on the deposit during the contract period? Does the buyer get a credit at closing for interest earned? Is the escrow agent required to invest the deposit?

- [ ] **Verify payment mechanics** -- How is the balance of the purchase price paid at closing? Are wire transfer requirements specified? Is same-day funds required?

- [ ] **Check financing contingency** -- Does the buyer have a financing contingency? If so, what are the terms (commitment deadline, rate lock, walk-away right)? If not, confirm the buyer is waiving financing contingency intentionally.
  - [TODO: Add firm's standard position on financing contingencies in institutional vs non-institutional deals]

- [ ] **Check purchase price allocation** -- Is there a purchase price allocation for tax purposes? Does it require mutual agreement? Are there allocation disputes mechanisms?

- [ ] **Verify earnest money letter of credit option** -- Can the deposit be posted as a letter of credit instead of cash? What are the LC requirements (issuer, form, amount, expiration)?

### Key Risks

| Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Deposit goes hard immediately (Day 1) | High -- buyer loses exit flexibility; negotiate soft deposit through DD period expiration | Favorable -- increases buyer commitment from execution |
| No financing contingency | High if buyer needs financing -- negotiate contingency with reasonable commitment deadline | Favorable -- eliminates closing risk from buyer financing failure |
| No additional deposit trigger after DD | Medium -- buyer has lower at-risk amount throughout contract period | Unfavorable -- seller wants additional deposit to increase buyer commitment |
| Interest on deposit to seller | Low -- small economic impact but precedent matters | Low -- minor economic benefit |
| Restricted Period before DD expiration | High -- effectively shortens the DD period for termination purposes | Favorable -- prevents last-minute termination after substantial seller effort |
| No price adjustment mechanism | Medium -- buyer bears risk of changes between signing and closing (occupancy changes, expense increases) | Favorable -- purchase price is fixed |
| [TODO: Add additional risks from firm experience] | | |

---

## 4. Due Diligence / Investigation Period [Common]

### Review Points

- [ ] **Check DD period length** -- How many days does the buyer have for due diligence? Is the period adequate for the property type and complexity? Is there an extension right?
  - See: market-standards.md > 4. Due Diligence / Investigation Period > DD Period Length
  - [TODO: Add firm's standard DD periods by deal size and complexity]

- [ ] **Verify DD extension right** -- Can the buyer extend the DD period? What are the conditions (additional deposit, notice, number of extensions, maximum total period)?

- [ ] **Check DD materials delivery obligation** -- Is the seller required to deliver DD materials within a specified period? Is there a schedule of required documents attached? Is there a day-for-day extension if seller delays delivery?

- [ ] **Verify access rights** -- Does the buyer have adequate access to the property for inspections, testing, and environmental assessments? Can the buyer's consultants, appraisers, and engineers access the property? What notice is required?

- [ ] **Check access agreement requirements** -- Does the seller require an access agreement or indemnity before entry? What insurance is required? Must the buyer repair damage? Is the buyer indemnifying the seller for losses caused by inspections?

- [ ] **Verify right to interview tenants** -- Can the buyer interview tenants, property managers, and local officials during DD? Is seller consent required? Must the seller be present?

- [ ] **Check termination right scope** -- Can the buyer terminate for any reason during the DD period, or only for specified objections? Is the termination right "sole and absolute discretion"?

- [ ] **Verify election mechanism** -- Must the buyer affirmatively elect to proceed (risk: forgetting to act = losing the deal) or does the transaction proceed unless buyer elects to terminate (risk: forgetting to act = being bound)?

- [ ] **Check DD reporting obligations** -- Must the buyer share DD findings with the seller? Must the buyer deliver copies of reports? Are there restrictions on sharing DD information with third parties?

- [ ] **Verify confidentiality during DD** -- Is DD information subject to confidentiality restrictions? Do restrictions survive termination? Can the buyer share information with lenders and investors?

- [ ] **Check study period for contracts** -- Does the DD period include the right to review and approve/reject existing service contracts, management agreements, and vendor contracts?

- [ ] **Verify environmental assessment rights** -- Can the buyer conduct Phase I and Phase II environmental site assessments? Are invasive testing rights included (soil borings, groundwater monitoring)? Is seller consent required for Phase II?

### Key Risks

| Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Short DD period (less than 30 days) | High -- insufficient time for thorough investigation of complex commercial property | Favorable -- limits buyer's exit window and accelerates deal timeline |
| No DD extension right | High -- buyer cannot extend if issues discovered late or third-party reports delayed | Favorable -- maintains deal certainty and timeline |
| Buyer must affirmatively elect to proceed | High -- administrative risk of losing deal by failing to send timely notice | Favorable -- deal falls away if buyer does not commit |
| DD reports must be shared with seller | Medium -- seller learns buyer's findings and can adjust position or claims | Favorable -- seller learns of property issues that may need addressing |
| No right to interview tenants | Medium -- buyer cannot independently verify lease terms and tenant satisfaction | Favorable -- seller controls tenant relationships during marketing |
| Buyer indemnifies seller for inspection damage | Medium -- exposure if environmental testing causes contamination spread | Low -- standard protection against inspection damage |
| [TODO: Add additional risks from firm experience] | | |

---

## 5. Title & Survey [Common]

### Review Points

- [ ] **Check title commitment requirements** -- Which party must order the title commitment? Is there a deadline for delivery? Must both parties' counsel receive copies? Who selects the title company?

- [ ] **Verify survey requirements** -- Can the buyer obtain a new ALTA/NSPS survey or update an existing survey? Who pays for the survey? Is the survey required to be certified to buyer and lender?

- [ ] **Check title objection process** -- What is the deadline for the buyer to deliver written title objections? What is the seller's response deadline? What is the buyer's deadline to respond to the seller's election?
  - See: market-standards.md > 5. Title & Survey > Title Objection Deadlines

- [ ] **Verify seller's cure obligations** -- Which title defects must the seller cure (voluntary liens, mortgages, judgments, tax liens, mechanics' liens)? Is there a cap on the seller's cure costs? Must the seller cure all monetary liens regardless of amount?

- [ ] **Check intervening title matters** -- Does the buyer have the right to object to new title matters that arise after the initial objection deadline but before closing? Is there a separate process for intervening objections?

- [ ] **Verify seller's title election options** -- Can the seller elect to cure, refuse to cure, or partially cure? What are the consequences of each election? Does the seller have an additional election period for intervening matters?

- [ ] **Check buyer's remedies if title uncured** -- Can the buyer terminate and receive the deposit back? Can the buyer close with uncured exceptions and receive a credit? Can the buyer seek specific performance?

- [ ] **Verify permitted exceptions scope** -- Are permitted exceptions limited to specifically listed items, or do they include broad categories (all matters of record, all matters a current survey would show)?

- [ ] **Check violations cure obligations** -- Must the seller cure all violations or conditions that may lead to violations? Must the seller pay all fines and penalties? Must the seller arrange inspections to clear violations of record? Is there an escrow for uncured violations?

- [ ] **Verify title insurance requirements** -- What form of owner's title policy is required (standard vs extended)? Are specific endorsements required? Is the title company's standard exceptions list acceptable or must exceptions be removed?

- [ ] **Check existing property agreements** -- For each REA, condominium declaration, or other recorded agreement: are there ROFR/ROFO rights to waive, required notices, required estoppels, or required amendments at closing?

- [ ] **Verify lien law affidavit requirements** -- Is the deed required to include a lien law clause (jurisdiction-specific, e.g., NY Section 13)?

### Key Risks

| Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| No right to object to intervening title matters | High -- new encumbrances recorded after initial objection deadline are unchallenged | Favorable -- eliminates new objection rounds |
| Seller can refuse to cure any title defect | High -- buyer left with take-it-or-leave-it choice on serious title issues | Favorable -- no obligation to spend money curing defects |
| Broad permitted exceptions definition | High -- buyer may take subject to unanticipated encumbrances | Favorable -- reduces scope of title obligations |
| Cap on seller's cure costs | Medium -- seller not required to spend above cap to clear title | Favorable -- limits exposure to title cure costs |
| No violations cure obligation | High -- buyer may inherit open violations with fines and compliance costs | Favorable -- eliminates pre-closing violation cure burden |
| [TODO: Add additional risks from firm experience] | | |

## 6. Representations & Warranties [Common]

### Review Points

- [ ] **Catalog all seller representations** -- List every representation and warranty the seller is making. Are the standard categories covered: authority, no conflicts, compliance with laws, litigation, environmental, leases, contracts, taxes, FIRPTA, OFAC/sanctions, solvency?

- [ ] **Check authority and enforceability representations** -- Does the seller represent valid organization, good standing, authority to execute, no consenting parties needed, and binding effect? Does the seller represent no conflicts with existing agreements or encumbrances?

- [ ] **Verify FIRPTA representation** -- Does the seller represent it is not a "foreign person" under Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code? Is the seller required to deliver a FIRPTA certificate at closing?

- [ ] **Check OFAC/sanctions representation** -- Does the seller represent it is not a blocked person or on OFAC/government sanctions lists? Does the representation extend to beneficial owners?

- [ ] **Verify solvency representation** -- Does the seller represent solvency, no pending bankruptcy, and no attachment or receivership of assets?

- [ ] **Check litigation representation** -- Does the seller represent no pending or threatened litigation affecting the property? Is there a disclosure exception for matters being defended by insurance?

- [ ] **Verify environmental representation** -- Does the seller represent no known environmental contamination, no underground storage tanks, no hazardous materials violations, and no pending environmental claims? What knowledge qualifier applies?

- [ ] **Check lease representations** -- Does the seller represent the lease schedule is complete and accurate? Are representations made about tenant defaults, security deposits, rent abatements, landlord obligations, and lease options?

- [ ] **Verify contract representations** -- Does the seller represent the contract list is complete? Are representations made about contract defaults, termination rights, and assignment provisions?

- [ ] **Check knowledge qualifier on representations** -- Which representations are qualified by knowledge? Is the qualifier appropriate (some reps should not be knowledge-qualified, e.g., authority, FIRPTA status)?

- [ ] **Verify materiality qualifiers** -- Are representations qualified by materiality? Is the threshold defined? Is double-materiality an issue (MAE in rep + materiality in bring-down)?

- [ ] **Check anti-sandbagging provision** -- Is there an anti-sandbagging clause limiting buyer's post-closing claims for matters known to buyer before closing? What is the buyer's deemed knowledge standard (actual knowledge vs. matters disclosed in DD)?

- [ ] **Verify bring-down certificate** -- Must the seller deliver a bring-down certificate at closing confirming representations remain true? Is the standard "true in all material respects" or "true in all respects"?

- [ ] **Check no-representations clause** -- Is there a clause stating the buyer is not relying on any representations not expressly set forth in the agreement? How broad is the disclaimer?

- [ ] **Verify survival period** -- How long do representations survive closing? Is the period adequate for the types of representations being made (1 month to 1 year is typical; environmental may warrant longer)?
  - See: market-standards.md > 6. Representations & Warranties > Survival Period

- [ ] **Check remedy for breach of reps** -- What is the remedy for breach? Is there a cap on liability (e.g., 1% of purchase price)? Is there a deductible/basket? Is the indemnification the exclusive remedy?

- [ ] **Verify buyer's representations** -- What representations is the buyer making? Are they balanced and reciprocal (authority, no conflicts, OFAC)?

- [ ] **Check purchaser's knowledge definition** -- What is the buyer deemed to know? Does it include matters disclosed in DD materials, matters discoverable from property inspection, or matters disclosed by read_docx output?

- [ ] **Verify dissolution restriction** -- Can the seller entity be dissolved or wound up after closing? Is there a survival period for the entity (6 months to 1 year typical)?

- [ ] **Check security for rep breaches** -- Is the seller required to post security (escrow, letter of credit, parent guarantee) in case representations are false? What is the amount (1-10% of purchase price)?
  - [TODO: Add firm's standard security amounts by deal type and risk profile]

- [ ] **Evaluate knowledge qualifications for elimination** -- For each knowledge-qualified representation, determine whether the subject matter is within Seller's operational knowledge (rent rolls, lease terms, financials, environmental condition, property condition, tenant defaults, contract status, compliance history). If so, the buyer-side position is an **absolute representation with a disclosure schedule** as the safety valve -- not a knowledge-qualified rep. Knowledge qualifications are appropriate only for matters genuinely outside the knowledge person's scope (undisclosed third-party claims, future regulatory actions). Flag every knowledge-qualified operational rep for potential conversion. At Level 4-5, conversion is mandatory; at Level 3, flag as recommendation.

### Key Risks

| Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Knowledge qualifier on critical reps (environmental, compliance) | High -- seller can disclaim knowledge of defects known at property level | Favorable -- limits exposure to actual principal knowledge |
| Short survival period (less than 6 months) | High -- insufficient time to discover and assert claims for breaches | Favorable -- quick cutoff of post-closing exposure |
| Anti-sandbagging clause | High -- buyer may lose claims for known issues even if seller concealed them | Favorable -- eliminates gotcha claims for disclosed matters |
| No security for rep breaches | High -- seller entity may be dissolved or judgment-proof post-closing | Favorable -- no capital tied up post-closing |
| Low cap on rep breach liability (less than 1% of purchase price) | High -- insufficient recovery for material breaches | Favorable -- limits total exposure |
| No-representations clause undermines express reps | High -- buyer's reliance on express reps may be challenged | Favorable -- reinforces as-is nature of transaction |
| Double materiality (MAE in rep + material bring-down) | Medium -- significantly narrows scope of effective reps | Favorable -- raises threshold for claims |
| Knowledge qualifier on operational matters (rent roll, financials, property condition) with no disclosure schedule alternative | High -- seller shelters behind "to Seller's knowledge" for matters it controls and should know absolutely; disclosure schedule would provide same protection without the knowledge shield | Favorable -- knowledge qualifier limits exposure to actual awareness of named knowledge parties |
| [TODO: Add additional risks from firm experience] | | |

## 7. Seller's Pre-Closing Covenants [Common]

### Review Points

- [ ] **Check insurance maintenance obligation** -- Must the seller keep the property insured until closing? What level of coverage is required? Is the buyer a named insured or loss payee?

- [ ] **Verify property operation and maintenance obligation** -- Must the seller operate and maintain the property in ordinary course until closing? Or can the seller rely on tenants to maintain their premises?

- [ ] **Check new contract restrictions** -- Is the seller prohibited from entering new service agreements that survive closing or require termination payments? Is the buyer's consent required for new contracts? Is there a dollar or duration threshold below which consent is not needed?

- [ ] **Verify leasing restrictions** -- Must the seller obtain buyer consent before entering new leases, amendments, or lease terminations? Is there a distinction between Major Tenant and Non-Major Tenant leasing? Are Lease Transaction thresholds defined (square footage, rent, term)?
  - [TODO: Add firm's standard leasing consent thresholds by property type]

- [ ] **Check no-encumbrance covenant** -- Is the seller prohibited from subjecting the property to new liens, encumbrances, easements, or restrictions? Is there an exception for leasing activity approved by buyer?

- [ ] **Verify no-sale covenant** -- Is the seller prohibited from marketing or contracting with other parties for the sale of the property?

- [ ] **Check construction/development covenants** -- If property is under construction: must the seller deliver construction documents, cooperate with buyer's consultants, assign warranties, and close out permits?

- [ ] **Verify land use covenant** -- Is the seller prohibited from applying for zoning changes, variances, subdivisions, or lot line amendments without buyer consent?

- [ ] **Check compliance with laws covenant** -- Must the seller maintain compliance with all applicable laws and regulations through closing?

### Key Risks

| Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| No leasing consent right | High -- seller may enter unfavorable leases that reduce property value | Favorable -- seller maintains full leasing flexibility during contract period |
| Seller can enter new contracts without consent | Medium -- buyer may be bound to unfavorable vendor agreements | Favorable -- seller maintains operational flexibility |
| No insurance maintenance obligation | Medium -- gap in coverage if casualty occurs before closing | Low -- reduces seller's ongoing costs |
| Seller's covenant limited to "commercially reasonable efforts" | Medium -- lower standard reduces enforceability | Favorable -- limits obligation to reasonable standard |
| [TODO: Add additional risks from firm experience] | | |

---

## 8. Conditions Precedent to Closing [Common]

### Review Points

- [ ] **Check buyer's closing conditions** -- What must be true or delivered for the buyer to be obligated to close? Standard conditions: seller reps true at closing, seller deliveries complete, seller covenants performed, no material adverse change, title insurance available, estoppels delivered.

- [ ] **Verify seller's closing conditions** -- What must be true for the seller to be obligated to close? Standard conditions: buyer reps true, buyer deliveries complete, buyer has ready and able to close.

- [ ] **Check rep bring-down condition** -- Must all seller representations be true at closing? What standard (in all respects, in all material respects, true except for disclosed matters)? Is a bring-down certificate required?

- [ ] **Verify estoppel condition** -- Is delivery of tenant estoppels a condition to buyer's closing? What percentage of tenants must deliver (by NRA or count)? Must Major Tenant estoppels be included?

- [ ] **Check financing condition** -- Is the buyer's obtaining financing a condition to closing? If yes, what terms must the financing meet? If no, confirm buyer is aware it closes regardless.

- [ ] **Verify title condition** -- Is title insurance being issued on permitted-exceptions-only terms a condition to closing? Are specific endorsements required as a condition?

- [ ] **Check no-material-adverse-change condition** -- Is there a condition that no material adverse change has occurred since the effective date? How is "material adverse change" defined?

- [ ] **Verify no-proceedings condition** -- Is it a condition that no judicial or administrative proceeding is pending against the seller or property that would bind the buyer?

- [ ] **Check rent roll condition** -- Is it a condition that there has been no material change to the rent roll since the date provided to buyer?

- [ ] **Verify waiver right** -- Can the buyer waive unsatisfied conditions and require the seller to close? Can the seller waive its conditions?

- [ ] **Check failure-of-condition consequences** -- What happens if a condition is not satisfied? Automatic termination, right to terminate, or adjournment right?

### Key Risks

| Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Weak bring-down standard ("in all material respects" with high MAE threshold) | High -- seller reps can deteriorate significantly without triggering condition failure | Favorable -- reduces risk of failed closing |
| No estoppel delivery condition | High -- buyer closes without tenant confirmation of lease terms | Favorable -- eliminates closing delay from tenant non-cooperation |
| No MAC condition | Medium -- buyer bears risk of intervening adverse changes | Favorable -- eliminates buyer exit right for market changes |
| Buyer cannot waive conditions | Medium -- buyer loses flexibility to close despite technical condition failures | Favorable -- protects seller from selective waiver arguments |
| [TODO: Add additional risks from firm experience] | | |

---

## 9. Closing Mechanics [Common]

### Review Points

- [ ] **Verify closing date** -- Is the closing date a specific date, a formula date, or upon satisfaction of conditions? Is the date realistic given DD period, title cure period, and financing timeline?

- [ ] **Check adjournment rights** -- Can either party adjourn the closing? For how long? How many times? What are the conditions for adjournment (e.g., prior written notice, minimum days before scheduled closing)?

- [ ] **Verify closing type** -- Is the closing a sit-down closing or escrow closing? If sit-down, where (seller's attorney, buyer's lender, title company)?

- [ ] **Check time of the essence** -- Is the closing date "time of the essence"? If so, is there an automatic default if the closing does not occur on time? Is there a notice requirement before TOE applies?

- [ ] **Verify closing extension for financing** -- Can the buyer extend the closing to accommodate financing requirements (rate lock expiration, lender processing time)?

- [ ] **Check closing extension for title cure** -- Can closing be extended to allow time for title cure? Is there a limit on the extension period?

- [ ] **Verify outside date** -- Is there an outside date after which either party can terminate if closing has not occurred? What happens to the deposit if the outside date passes?

- [ ] **Check pre-closing walkthrough** -- Does the buyer have the right to a pre-closing walkthrough or inspection of the property?

### Key Risks

| Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Time of the essence closing with no adjournment right | High -- administrative delays or lender issues could trigger default | Favorable -- certainty of closing timeline |
| No adjournment right for financing delays | High -- buyer may default if lender delays processing | Favorable -- eliminates indefinite delay risk |
| No outside date | Medium -- deal could remain pending indefinitely if conditions not satisfied | Medium -- seller's property tied up without closure |
| [TODO: Add additional risks from firm experience] | | |

## 10. Closing Deliveries [Common]

### Review Points

- [ ] **Check seller's required deliveries** -- Does the PSA specify all required seller closing deliveries? Standard deliveries: deed, bill of sale, assignment of leases, assignment of contracts, FIRPTA certificate, owner's affidavit, entity authorization consent, bring-down certificate, tenant notices, keys/access codes, originals of leases, plans and surveys.

- [ ] **Verify deed form** -- What type of deed is required (warranty, special warranty, bargain and sale with covenants, quitclaim)? Is a form attached as an exhibit? Is a lien law clause required? Must the deed be approved by the title company?
  - See: market-standards.md > 10. Closing Deliveries > Deed Type

- [ ] **Check bill of sale** -- If personal property is included, is a bill of sale required? Does it include representations of ownership and no liens? Does it address condition of personal property?

- [ ] **Verify assignment of leases** -- Is there a form assignment attached? Does it include an indemnity from seller for pre-closing landlord obligations? Does it address tenant security deposits?

- [ ] **Check assignment of contracts** -- Is there a form assignment for assumed contracts? Does it include proof of payment by seller through closing? Does it include seller indemnity for pre-closing obligations?

- [ ] **Verify tax forms** -- Are all required tax forms specified (FIRPTA certificate, state transfer tax forms, city transfer tax forms)? Are jurisdiction-specific forms identified (e.g., NY TP-584, NYC-RPT)?

- [ ] **Check management termination evidence** -- Must the seller deliver evidence of termination of the management agreement? Must the seller pay all management fees through closing?

- [ ] **Verify catch-all delivery provision** -- Is there a general provision requiring the seller to deliver any other documents required by the title company, buyer's lender, or escrow agent?

- [ ] **Check buyer's required deliveries** -- Are the buyer's closing deliveries specified (purchase price, entity authorization, counterpart of assignment and assumption agreements)?

- [ ] **Verify form attachments** -- Are forms of all closing deliveries attached as exhibits to the PSA? Are the forms pre-approved by both parties?

- [ ] **Check document execution requirements** -- Are documents required to be signed, acknowledged, and/or certified as appropriate? Is a sufficient number of originals required?

### Key Risks

| Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Quitclaim deed instead of special warranty | High -- no title covenants; buyer relies entirely on title insurance | Favorable -- no post-closing title liability |
| No form documents attached | Medium -- closing deliveries may not match expectations; last-minute negotiation | Medium -- same risk applies |

## 11. Costs, Prorations & Adjustments [Common]

### Review Points

- [ ] **Check cost allocation** -- Are transfer taxes, recording fees, title insurance premiums, survey costs, and escrow fees allocated between buyer and seller? Does the allocation match market custom for the jurisdiction?
  - See: market-standards.md > 11. Costs, Prorations & Adjustments > Cost Allocation
  - [TODO: Add firm's standard cost allocation by jurisdiction]

- [ ] **Verify proration methodology** -- Are prorations calculated as of the closing date? Is the closing date a buyer day or seller day? Are prorations based on a 365-day year or 360-day year?

- [ ] **Check real estate tax prorations** -- Are taxes prorated based on the most recent bill or estimated for the current year? Is there a reproration mechanism when the actual tax bill is received? Are tax abatements or PILOT payments addressed?

- [ ] **Verify rent prorations** -- Are rents prorated as of the closing date? How is delinquent rent handled? Is the seller entitled to collect delinquent rent post-closing? What are the allocation priorities (current month first, then arrears)?

- [ ] **Check security deposit transfer** -- Must the seller transfer or credit all tenant security deposits to the buyer at closing? Are letters of credit as security deposits addressed?

- [ ] **Verify utility deposit and prepaid item transfer** -- Are utility deposits and prepaid expenses (insurance, maintenance contracts) credited to the seller?

- [ ] **Check operating expense reconciliation** -- For properties with CAM/operating expense pass-throughs, how are tenant reimbursements prorated? Is there a true-up mechanism after closing?

- [ ] **Check Lease Expense allocation** -- Are tenant improvement allowances and landlord work costs allocated between buyer and seller based on when the lease was signed or when the costs are incurred?

- [ ] **Verify insurance proration** -- Are insurance premiums prorated? Or is the buyer expected to obtain its own policy?

### Key Risks

| Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| No post-closing reproration for taxes | High -- buyer bears risk if actual taxes exceed estimates | Favorable -- clean break on tax liability |

- [ ] **Check material taking definition** -- How is "material condemnation" or "material taking" defined? Does it include partial takings that affect access, parking, or buildable area?

- [ ] **Verify buyer's termination right** -- If a material casualty or material taking occurs, can the buyer terminate and receive the deposit back? Is there adequate time to assess the damage or scope of taking before the termination deadline?

- [ ] **Check buyer's election to close** -- If the buyer elects to close despite a casualty or condemnation, does the buyer receive the insurance proceeds or condemnation awards? Is there a purchase price credit for uninsured or underinsured losses?

- [ ] **Verify insurance proceeds assignment** -- Are insurance proceeds assigned to the buyer at closing? Must the seller maintain insurance through closing? Are deductibles credited to the buyer?

- [ ] **Check condemnation award assignment** -- Are condemnation awards assigned to the buyer at closing? Does the buyer have input on the condemnation settlement?

- [ ] **Verify waiver of statutory provisions** -- Do the parties waive Section 5-1311 of the NY General Obligations Law (or equivalent state statute governing risk of loss in executory contracts)?

- [ ] **Check non-material casualty handling** -- For casualties below the material threshold, does the seller have an obligation to repair? Or does the buyer close with a credit for the cost of repair?

- [ ] **Verify tenant termination impact** -- If a casualty or condemnation triggers a tenant's termination right, does that factor into the materiality determination or give the buyer a separate termination right?

### Key Risks

| Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| High material casualty threshold | High -- significant damage may not trigger buyer's termination right | Favorable -- reduces buyer exit opportunities |
| No termination right for tenant lease terminations triggered by casualty | High -- buyer may close into property with lost tenants | Favorable -- risk passes to buyer at closing regardless |
| Uninsured or underinsured loss with no price credit | High -- buyer bears the gap between insurance proceeds and repair cost | Favorable -- limits seller's financial exposure |

## 13. Default & Remedies [Common]

### Review Points

- [ ] **Verify exculpation clause** -- Is there an exculpation limiting recourse to the seller entity only (no recourse to individual members, managers, officers, or affiliates)? How broad is the exculpation?

- [ ] **Check attorneys' fees** -- Does the prevailing party in a default dispute recover attorneys' fees? Or does each party bear its own costs?

### Key Risks

| Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Seller can pursue actual damages beyond deposit for buyer default | High -- buyer exposure exceeds deposit amount | Favorable -- full recovery for buyer breach |
| No specific performance for buyer | High -- buyer's only remedy is return of deposit if seller refuses to close | Favorable -- limits seller's exposure to monetary damages only |
| Broad exculpation with no recourse beyond seller entity | High -- if seller entity has no assets post-closing, buyer has no remedy | Favorable -- protects principals from personal liability |
| Low liability cap on seller | High -- insufficient recovery for material defaults | Favorable -- limits total exposure regardless of claim size |
| No cure period for non-monetary default | Medium -- technical breach could be declared default without opportunity to fix | Unfavorable -- same exposure to buyer defaults |
| [TODO: Add additional risks from firm experience] | | |

- [ ] **Check carve-outs from AS-IS** -- Are the seller's express representations and warranties carved out from the AS-IS provision? Is fraud carved out? Are specific covenants carved out?

### Key Risks

| Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| AS-IS undermines express seller reps | High -- contradictory language creates ambiguity; seller may argue reps are superseded | Favorable -- additional layer of protection beyond rep limitations |
| No carve-out for fraud | High -- seller's affirmative fraud may be shielded | Favorable -- broad protection from post-closing claims |
| Environmental claim waiver | High -- buyer waives ability to assert environmental claims even for concealed contamination | Favorable -- clean break on environmental liability |
| AS-IS extends to legal compliance | Medium -- buyer takes risk of code violations and regulatory non-compliance | Favorable -- shifts compliance risk to buyer |

- [ ] **Check indemnification basket/deductible** -- Is there a minimum threshold (basket or deductible) before indemnification claims can be asserted? Is the basket a true deductible (only amounts above) or a tipping basket (all amounts once threshold is met)?

- [ ] **Verify indemnification survival period** -- How long does the indemnification obligation survive closing? Is it coterminous with the rep survival period or independent?

- [ ] **Check exclusive remedy provision** -- Is the indemnification the exclusive post-closing remedy, or can the buyer pursue other claims (tort, fraud, equity)?

- [ ] **Verify defense and settlement procedures** -- Who controls defense of third-party claims? Must the indemnifying party consent to settlements? Is there a duty to cooperate?

### Key Risks

| Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective |
