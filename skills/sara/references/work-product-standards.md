# Work Product Standards by Document Type

## General Standards

All documents Sara produces follow these baseline standards:

- **Clean prose** — no unnecessary legalese, no filler, no throat-clearing paragraphs
- **Active voice** — prefer "the Landlord shall deliver" over "delivery shall be made by the Landlord"
- **Defined terms** — capitalize and use consistently; define on first use or in a definitions section
- **Parallel structure** — lists and enumerated provisions use consistent grammatical form
- **Precision** — every sentence says exactly what it means; ambiguity is a defect

## Memoranda

### Internal Research Memo

**Structure:**
1. **Header block** — To, From (Sara), Date, Re
2. **Question Presented** — specific legal question in one sentence
3. **Short Answer** — 2-4 sentence direct answer
4. **Factual Background** — relevant facts, stated neutrally
5. **Analysis** — IRAC structure (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) for each sub-issue
6. **Conclusion** — summary of analysis with recommendation

**Standards:**
- State the question precisely — a well-framed question is half the answer
- Short answer should be direct: "Yes, because..." or "No, because..." not "It depends"
- Analysis should address counterarguments
- Cite every legal proposition
- Distinguish binding from persuasive authority
- Note uncertainty honestly — "the law is unsettled" when it is

### Client-Facing Memo

**Structure:**
1. **Header block** — To (client), From (firm), Date, Re
2. **Executive Summary** — key takeaways in 3-5 bullet points
3. **Background** — factual and legal context the client needs
4. **Analysis** — organized by issue, written for a sophisticated non-lawyer
5. **Recommendations** — specific, actionable next steps
6. **Risk Assessment** — material risks with likelihood and impact

**Standards:**
- Write for a sophisticated businessperson, not a judge
- Lead with the answer, then explain
- Minimize citations in the body; use footnotes if needed
- Focus on practical implications, not legal theory
- Include a clear recommendation — clients want advice, not just analysis
- Flag what requires a business decision vs. a legal one

## Agreements

### Contract Drafting

**Structure:**
1. **Preamble** — parties, date, defined short names
2. **Recitals** — background and purpose (WHEREAS clauses or plain-English introduction)
3. **Definitions** — if more than 5 defined terms, use a separate section
4. **Operative provisions** — the deal terms, organized logically
5. **Representations and warranties** — if applicable
6. **Covenants** — ongoing obligations
7. **Conditions** — to closing or performance

9. **Termination** — how and when the agreement ends
10. **General provisions** — governing law, dispute resolution, notices, amendments, severability, entire agreement, counterparts
11. **Signature blocks**

**Standards:**
- Use "shall" for obligations, "will" for future facts, "may" for permissions
- Define terms precisely — bracket [DEFINED TERM] any term needing client input
- Cross-reference correctly — section numbers, defined terms
- Draft symmetrically where appropriate — if one party has a right, consider whether the other should too
- Include operative dates and deadlines
- Use "including, without limitation" or "including but not limited to" consistently (pick one)
- Number sections and subsections consistently

### Contract Amendments

**Standards:**
- Reference the original agreement precisely (title, date, parties)
- Use "hereby amended" language
- Restate the provision being amended, then state the amendment
- Include a confirmation that all other terms remain in effect
- Match the style and defined terms of the original agreement

## Correspondence

### Draft Emails

**Structure:**
1. **Subject line** — clear, specific

3. **Purpose** — first sentence states why you're writing
4. **Body** — organized, concise
5. **Action items** — specific asks or next steps, bolded or bulleted
6. **Close** — professional sign-off

**Standards:**
- Match the tone to the recipient and relationship
- One email, one purpose — don't bury asks
- Put the ask or action item early, not at the end
- Be specific about deadlines: "by Friday, February 20" not "soon"
- For sensitive topics, note that this is a draft for partner review

### Draft Letters

**Structure:**
1. **Letterhead placeholder** — [FIRM LETTERHEAD]
2. **Date and addressee**
3. **Re line** — matter reference
4. **Body** — formal, precise
5. **Signature block** — partner name (Sara notes who should sign)

**Standards:**
- More formal than email — complete sentences, no contractions
- Reference relevant agreements, statutes, or prior correspondence by date
- State the firm's position clearly
- Include specific demands, deadlines, or next steps
- Note privileged/confidential status if applicable

## Briefs and Motions

3. **Statement of Facts** — relevant facts with record citations
4. **Legal Standard** — applicable standard of review
5. **Argument** — organized under descriptive point headings
6. **Conclusion** — specific relief requested

**Standards:**
- Point headings should be complete sentences that state the conclusion
- Lead with strongest argument
- Address and distinguish adverse authority — don't ignore it
- Cite the record for every factual assertion
- Use parentheticals for case citations to show relevance
- Comply with applicable court rules (page limits, formatting, filing requirements)
- Note: Sara will flag court-specific rules she's aware of and ask about any she's not sure about

## Summaries and Analyses

### Due Diligence Summary

**Structure:**
1. **Overview** — what was reviewed, scope of review
2. **Key Findings** — material issues, organized by category
3. **Risk Matrix** — severity and likelihood for each finding

5. **Recommendations** — suggested actions for each material finding

### Issue Spotting / Risk Assessment

**Structure:**
1. **Executive Summary** — top 3-5 issues
2. **Issues by Category** — organized by risk level or subject matter
3. **For each issue:**
   - Description of the issue
   - Why it matters (commercial impact)
   - Likelihood and severity
   - Recommended action
4. **Next Steps** — prioritized action items

**Standards:**
- Rank issues by materiality — don't bury the important ones
- Distinguish legal risk from business risk
- Be specific about probability: "likely," "possible," "remote" with basis
- Provide actionable recommendations, not just issue identification

## Contract Redlines

### Redlined Agreement

A redline is a tracked-changes document showing proposed revisions to opposing counsel's paper, with Word comment bubbles explaining each change.

**Deliverable package (never send a naked redline):**
1. **Transmittal memo** -- cover note with risk flagging and key changes
2. **Redlined .docx** -- track changes with comment bubbles
3. **Clean .docx** -- clean version (if applicable)
4. **Disposition table** -- as appendix to the transmittal (Level 4-5)

**Comment bubble standards:**
- 1-2 sentences explaining the *commercial rationale*, not a legal treatise
- Frame changes as market-standard where possible ("This is market for institutional sellers")
- Flag drafting errors explicitly -- it builds credibility
- For provisions where you're adding new language (not just modifying), quote the proposed language in the comment
- For every comment, include market rationale where applicable

**Track change standards:**
- Every change in the risk map must have a corresponding tracked change or comment
- Every revision must have a corresponding entry in the disposition table
- Group coordinated changes consistently (e.g., fraud carve-outs appear in every relevant section)
- Don't skip long paragraphs -- if the diff tool can't handle the full text, use targeted comments with exact proposed insertion language
- Verify defined terms are consistent across all revised paragraphs

### Transmittal Memo

**To:** [Partner name]
**From:** Sara
**Date:** [Date]
**Re:** Review of [Document Type] -- [Property/Deal Name]

#### Deal Summary
2-3 sentences: parties, property, transaction type, purchase price, key dates.

#### Review Scope
- Representation: [Buyer/Seller/etc.]
- Aggressiveness Level: [1-5] -- [brief description of scope at this level]
- Document: [filename], [N] paragraphs, [date of document]
- Coverage: [X] paragraphs reviewed, [Y] revision entries, [Z] accepted, [W] commented
- Focus areas: [top 3-5 areas from analysis framework]

#### Key Changes (Top 5-10)
For each key change:
1. **[Section Ref] -- [Brief Title]** [Severity: HIGH/MEDIUM]
   - **Issue:** What the current language does and why it is a risk
   - **Change:** What was revised and the market rationale
   - **Partner note:** Anything requiring partner judgment or client input

#### Open Items
Organized by contract provision:

##### Due Diligence
| Item | Section | Issue | Severity | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|----------|-------|

##### Representations & Warranties
| Item | Section | Issue | Severity | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|----------|-------|

##### Default & Remedies
| Item | Section | Issue | Severity | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|----------|-------|

[Add sections for each provision category with open items]

#### Disposition Table (Appendix)
[Full Section A table from document-reviewer output -- all paragraphs, all columns]

**Important notes on transmittal format:**
- **Risk flagging over strategy**: Sara identifies risks and severity but does NOT recommend negotiation strategy. The transmittal uses "Key Changes" (risk-flagging) and "Open Items" (organized by provision) -- not "Must-haves", "Strong preferences", or "Nice-to-haves" which imply negotiation strategy.
- **Open items embedded**: Not a separate file. Embedded in the transmittal memo organized by contract provision.
- **Disposition table as appendix**: The full paragraph disposition table is included so the partner can see exactly what Sara reviewed.

### Delivery Format

The transmittal package is delivered as:
1. **.msg file** for MS Outlook (Windows) -- the transmittal memo text is the email body; attachments are the clean docx, redline docx, and disposition table appendix
2. **Markdown summary** in chat -- a brief cover note summarizing what Sara did and what needs partner attention

If the .msg utility is not yet available, Sara prepares all components as separate files and notes the packaging step.

The .msg file should be a complete, ready-to-forward package: open in Outlook, review, hit Send.

**Standards:**
- Follow the contract review workflow in `references/contract-review-workflow.md`
- Run a cross-reference check before generating the redline
- Propose new provisions where the existing agreement is missing market-standard protections
- Always run `analyze_contract` before starting the review

## Closing Checklist

### Structure

1. **Key Dates** table at top of the checklist:
   | Milestone | Date | PSA Reference |
   Populated with the deal's critical milestones (effective date, DD expiry, title objection deadline, closing date, post-closing deadlines).

2. **Items by responsible party** -- each party's section as a separate table:

   **Buyer Responsibilities**
   | # | Item | Deadline | PSA Ref | Status | Notes |

   **Seller Responsibilities**
   | # | Item | Deadline | PSA Ref | Status | Notes |

   **Escrow/Title Company**
   | # | Item | Deadline | PSA Ref | Status | Notes |

   **Lender** (if applicable)

### Column Standards

- **Item** -- specific to this PSA, not generic. "Deliver Phase I Environmental Report per Section 4.1(c)" not "Complete environmental inspections"
- **Deadline** -- absolute date or relative period from PSA. "April 15, 2026" or "15 days after Effective Date (Section 4.1)"
- **PSA Ref** -- section reference. Every item must have one.
- **Status** -- default: Pending. User updates to Received/Waived/Complete as applicable.

   - Deadline for cure (typically closing date or earlier per PSA)
7. **Acceptance statement** -- brief statement that buyer accepts the remaining Schedule B-II exceptions as permitted exceptions under the PSA (do not list each accepted exception individually)

   - Matters revealed by survey or inspections not yet completed
   - Any title defect discovered prior to closing

### Standards

- Every objection must specify the exact cure action -- "Release this deed of trust of record" not "Remove this encumbrance"
- Reference each exception by Schedule B-II number for precision
- Set cure deadline (typically closing date or earlier per PSA)

6. **Recommendations** -- prioritized action items for the partner

### Standards

- Write for a sophisticated businessperson or partner reviewing title
- Every exception gets a row -- Accept, Object, and Review items all discussed
- Standard exceptions discussed briefly (what they are, why they are standard) -- not skipped
