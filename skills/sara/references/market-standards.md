# RE PSA Market Standards

> **Usage:** Sara loads this file during Step 3 (framework building) of a PSA review for market data reference. Standards are organized by the same 24 categories as the PSA review checklist.
>
> **Populating this file:** Add market standard data from deal experience, surveys, and industry resources. Each entry should note the source and date.
>
> **Note:** The format for memorializing market standards is being refined (see GitHub issue #1). For now, use the simple entry format below. Each entry should include the standard, source, and any regional or deal-type variations.
