## 1. Estoppel Delivery Requirements -- Which Tenants and What Thresholds

### Preferred Position

Buyer should require estoppel certificates from **all tenants** occupying the property, with hard closing conditions tied to (a) **100% of Major Tenants** (individually named in the defined terms) and (b) tenants whose leases cover at least **85-90% of leased GLA** (or, for multifamily and data center, 85-90% of gross rental income). The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 7.1 / Closing Condition 10.1.3) establishes the framework: "Receipt of Conforming Tenant Estoppels from all of the Major Tenants plus a sufficient number of other Tenants under Leases so that Buyer has received Conforming Tenant Estoppels for Leases covering at least 80% of the currently leased square footage." Buyer should push this to 85-90%.

**Major Tenants** should be specifically named in Section 1 of the PSA (see UNICO Buyer Side, Section 1.9: "Major Tenants means (i) ___, (ii) ___, and (iii) ___"). Every tenant occupying more than 10% of the GLA (or contributing more than 10% of gross rental income) should be designated a Major Tenant, along with any anchor tenant critical to the property's cash flow or financing.

The Meadows form (Section 7.2) takes a more targeted approach, requiring estoppels only from specifically named tenants (Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. and Logical Position, LLC) as a closing condition, which reflects a seller-skewed negotiation. Buyer should reject this narrow approach and insist on threshold-based requirements.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **GLA vs. rent threshold:** For office and industrial, GLA-based thresholds are standard. For retail (where anchor tenants may lease disproportionate space at below-market rents) and multifamily (where unit count is more relevant than GLA), consider using gross rental income as the measuring stick, or a dual test (GLA and rent).
- **Major Tenant definition:** Name each Major Tenant explicitly AND include a definitional catch-all (e.g., "any tenant leasing more than 10,000 RSF or paying annual base rent in excess of $500,000").
- **100% request obligation vs. closing condition threshold:** Seller should be obligated to **request** estoppels from 100% of tenants, even if the closing condition is satisfied at a lower threshold.
- **Calculation methodology:** Specify whether the denominator is "currently leased square footage" (as in the UNICO form) or total leasable square footage. The former is more favorable to buyer because it excludes vacant space from the denominator.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Fallback chain:**
1. **Best position:** 100% of Major Tenants + 90% of GLA (by leased SF)
2. **First fallback:** 100% of Major Tenants + 85% of GLA
3. **Second fallback:** 100% of Major Tenants + 80% of GLA (the UNICO Buyer Side standard)
4. **Third fallback:** 100% of Major Tenants + 75% of GLA
5. **Floor position:** All named Major Tenants + 70% of GLA -- below this, the estoppel condition becomes commercially meaningless on multi-tenant properties

Seller will push for: (a) lower GLA thresholds, (b) the ability to substitute a Seller's Estoppel Certificate for missing tenant estoppels (see Section 6 below), (c) eliminating the "all Major Tenants" requirement in favor of a pure percentage test, and (d) counting estoppels delivered during due diligence toward the threshold.

**Resist strongly:** Any attempt to count estoppels delivered before the end of the study/due diligence period toward closing conditions. The extremely detailed seller-side PSA (Section 6.1(a)(iv)) provides: "all Tenant estoppel certificates provided to Purchaser before the end of the Study Period shall conclusively be deemed to count toward the satisfaction of the Estoppel Requirement." This is problematic because stale estoppels do not reflect current lease status. If forced to accept this, insist on a freshness requirement (see Section 8 below).

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk:** Accepting a threshold below 70% of GLA, or waiving the Major Tenant requirement, creates material underwriting risk. Buyer's lender will almost certainly require estoppels from all Major Tenants, and failure to obtain them may prevent financing.
- **Medium risk:** Accepting 75-80% of GLA if the tenant base is highly diversified and no single tenant represents more than 5% of revenue.
- **Low risk:** Accepting 80% threshold on a well-occupied, multi-tenant property with strong Major Tenant compliance history and short-form leases.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** GLA-based threshold is standard. Named Major Tenants should include any tenant above 10% of rentable area or any tenant whose lease is critical to the building's operating expense pass-through structure.
- **Industrial:** Similar to office but Major Tenant threshold may be lower (e.g., 5% of GLA) given that industrial properties often have fewer, larger tenants.
- **Retail:** Use gross rental income as the denominator rather than (or in addition to) GLA. Anchor tenants with below-market rents but critical co-tenancy obligations must be named as Major Tenants regardless of their rent contribution. Require estoppels from all pad-site tenants with separate ground leases.
- **Multifamily:** Estoppel requirements are typically relaxed given unit volume. Focus on commercial tenants within the property (retail pads, amenity operators). For residential units, a certified rent roll from the property manager plus a seller representation may substitute. If the property has any master lease or corporate housing arrangement, those lessees should be treated as Major Tenants.
- **Data Center:** Critical infrastructure tenants and any tenant with custom power or cooling arrangements should be named as Major Tenants. Use annualized revenue (including power charges) rather than GLA.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** The NY PSA Negotiation Checklist (Practical Law) emphasizes specifying which Major Tenants may deliver their own form of estoppel (see Section 3 below). NY practice is to tie estoppel delivery to a specific business-day deadline before closing.
- **California:** Many California commercial leases contain mandatory estoppel cooperation clauses under lease terms. Buyer should confirm the lease-required estoppel form and delivery timeline.
- **Texas:** No statutory estoppel obligation; rely entirely on lease provisions and PSA covenants.
- **Oregon:** The Meadows form (Lake Oswego, OR property) demonstrates a seller-favorable approach with named-tenant-only estoppel requirements; push for broader coverage in Oregon transactions.
- **Multi-state portfolios:** Each property in a portfolio should have its own estoppel threshold. Avoid a blended portfolio-wide threshold that could allow seller to skip estoppels at one property while exceeding them at another.

## 2. Estoppel Form Requirements

### Preferred Position

Buyer should attach a **negotiated form of estoppel certificate as an exhibit** to the PSA and require that all tenants complete substantially that form. The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 7.1) provides: "estoppel certificates from each of the Tenants in the form attached hereto as Exhibit K (or such other form that complies with the terms of the Tenant's Lease)." The attached Exhibit K (UNICO Buyer Side) is a comprehensive 14-item form that covers all critical data points (lease identification, term, rent, security deposit, defaults, offsets, options, assignments, subleases, TI completion, and reliance language).

The form hierarchy for buyer should be:
1. **Primary:** Buyer's form attached as exhibit to PSA
2. **Acceptable alternative:** The form required by the tenant's lease (if the lease specifies a particular form)
3. **Fallback:** A "commercially reasonable" form covering all items in the minimum content requirements (see Section 3)

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Exhibit attachment:** Always attach the estoppel form as an exhibit. The UNICO forms (both buyer and seller side), the detailed seller-side PSA (Exhibit B), and the Meadows form (Exhibit E) all follow this practice. The NY Checklist confirms: "attach a negotiated form of estoppel the tenants must complete."
- **"Substantially in the form" vs. "in the form":** Use "substantially in the form" to provide practical flexibility for tenant modifications that do not alter the substance. The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 7.1) and Meadows form (Section 6.1) both use "substantially in the form" language.
- **Major Tenant carve-out:** Major Tenants with significant bargaining power (national retailers, government tenants, credit tenants) will often insist on using their own estoppel form or the form specified in their lease. The NY Checklist addresses this: "Specify the major tenants... that may deliver their own form of estoppel." Accept this only if the tenant's form or lease-required form covers the minimum content requirements.
- **Government tenants:** The detailed seller-side PSA (Section 6.1(a)(iv)) specifically provides: "in connection with any Lease to a governmental body, then an estoppel certificate or confirmation letter or similar instrument in such governmental body's customary form shall be deemed to satisfy the requirement." Accept this carve-out for government tenants but verify their customary form covers minimum content.
- **Knowledge qualifiers:** The detailed seller-side PSA permits tenants to limit statements "to the best of the tenant's knowledge" or include general conditional statements like "we reserve all rights" or "subject to our audit rights as set forth in the Lease." Buyer should resist blanket acceptance of knowledge qualifiers on factual matters (rent amounts, security deposits, lease terms) but may accept them for default/claims items.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Fallback chain:**
1. **Best position:** All tenants complete buyer's attached form
2. **First fallback:** Major Tenants may use their lease-required form if it covers minimum content; all others use buyer's form
3. **Second fallback:** All tenants may use either buyer's form or their lease-required form, provided either covers minimum content
4. **Third fallback:** Any "commercially reasonable" form covering minimum content items
5. **Floor position:** Any written confirmation from tenant covering at minimum: lease identification, term, current rent, security deposit, default status, and absence of claims

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk:** Accepting estoppels that do not identify all lease amendments and modifications. This is the single most common source of post-closing disputes. The UNICO Buyer Side Exhibit K (item 1) and the detailed seller-side PSA (Exhibit B, item 1) both require attachment of a complete copy of the lease and all amendments.
- **Medium risk:** Accepting lease-form estoppels from Major Tenants that omit TI completion confirmation or landlord obligation compliance.
- **Low risk:** Accepting government-form estoppels from government tenants that cover the core items even if in a non-standard format.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** National and regional retailers (e.g., Starbucks, CVS, grocery anchors) almost universally insist on their own corporate form. Confirm their form covers co-tenancy, exclusive use, and operating covenant information.
- **Office:** Corporate tenants may have their own legal department forms. Government agency tenants (GSA, state agencies) will use their own forms exclusively.
- **Industrial:** Logistics and warehouse tenants generally more amenable to landlord-provided forms. Watch for tenants with specialized equipment or TI requirements.
- **Multifamily:** Standard form for commercial tenants within the property; no individual estoppel forms needed for residential tenants (use certified rent roll instead).
- **Data Center:** Hyperscale tenants (AWS, Microsoft, Google) will use their own forms. Ensure the form addresses power and cooling commitments, not just space.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** The NY Checklist specifically addresses form requirements and recommends attaching negotiated forms as exhibits.
- **California:** Some California lease forms incorporate statutory estoppel language under Civil Code provisions.
- **Illinois:** The IL Pro-Buyer Long Form would typically require a comprehensive estoppel form, though the source document was not fully readable.

## 3. Minimum Content Requirements for Estoppels

### Preferred Position

Every estoppel certificate, regardless of form, must confirm at minimum the following items. This list is derived from the combined requirements of the UNICO Buyer Side Exhibit K (14 items), the detailed seller-side PSA Exhibit B (9 items), and the Meadows Exhibit E:

1. **Lease identification:** Complete list of the lease and all amendments, modifications, supplements, side letters, addenda, and riders, with a complete copy attached (UNICO Buyer Side, item 1; detailed seller-side PSA, item 1)
2. **Lease status:** Confirmation that the lease is in full force and effect and has not been cancelled or terminated (UNICO Buyer Side, item 2; detailed seller-side PSA, item 2)
3. **Premises description:** Square footage and location within the building (UNICO Buyer Side, item 3)
4. **Lease term:** Commencement and expiration dates, including any exercised renewal options (UNICO Buyer Side, item 4; detailed seller-side PSA, item 6; Meadows, item 2)
5. **Current rent:** Base monthly rental amount and date through which rent has been paid, plus confirmation of additional rent obligations (UNICO Buyer Side, item 6; detailed seller-side PSA, item 7; Meadows, item 4)
6. **No advance rent payments:** Confirmation that no rent has been paid more than 30 days (or one month) in advance (detailed seller-side PSA, item 7; Meadows, item 4)
7. **Security deposit:** Amount and form (cash or letter of credit) currently held by landlord (UNICO Buyer Side, item 5; detailed seller-side PSA, item 8; Meadows, item 5)
8. **No defaults:** Confirmation that neither tenant nor landlord is in default, and no conditions exist that with notice or passage of time would constitute a default (UNICO Buyer Side, item 7; detailed seller-side PSA, item 9)
9. **No offsets or credits:** Confirmation that tenant has no offsets, defenses, or credits against rent (UNICO Buyer Side, item 8; detailed seller-side PSA, item 3)
10. **No purchase options:** Confirmation of whether tenant has any options or rights of first refusal to purchase the property or any interest therein (UNICO Buyer Side, item 9)
11. **Expansion/additional space rights:** Identification of any options or rights of first refusal for additional space (UNICO Buyer Side, item 10)
12. **No assignment or pledge:** Confirmation that tenant's leasehold interest has not been assigned, hypothecated, or pledged (UNICO Buyer Side, item 11)
13. **No subleases:** Identification of any subleases in effect (UNICO Buyer Side, item 13)
14. **TI/landlord obligation completion:** Confirmation that all landlord construction and improvement obligations have been completed and all tenant improvement allowances have been paid (UNICO Buyer Side, item 14; Meadows, item 7)
15. **Reliance language:** Express statement that buyer, any assignee of buyer, any lender financing the acquisition, and their respective successors and assigns may rely on the estoppel certificate (UNICO Buyer Side, item at top; detailed seller-side PSA, item at bottom; Meadows, item 8)

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Lender reliance:** Buyer's lender will typically require that the estoppel expressly name the lender (or at least "any lender making a loan secured by the Property") as an intended beneficiary. The UNICO Buyer Side Exhibit K and the detailed seller-side PSA Exhibit B both include this language. This is non-negotiable when buyer is financing.
- **Copy of lease attached:** Items 1 above is critical. If the tenant attaches the lease documents, buyer has confirmation of the complete lease file without relying solely on seller's representations.
- **Renewal options and expansion rights:** These directly affect underwriting. If the lease has below-market renewal options or the tenant has rights to significant additional space, buyer needs this confirmed in the estoppel.
- **Percentage rent (retail):** For retail tenants with percentage rent provisions, the estoppel should also confirm gross sales breakpoints and current percentage rent obligations.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Sellers will argue that many tenants will not complete a detailed 14-item estoppel. The fallback is:

**Minimum "floor" content (absolute minimum for any estoppel to count):**
1. Lease identification (with all amendments listed, even if not attached)
2. Lease term (commencement and expiration)
3. Current base rent and date paid through
4. Security deposit amount
5. No landlord or tenant default (may be qualified to knowledge)
6. Reliance language covering buyer and buyer's lender

If an estoppel omits even these six items, it should not count toward the threshold.

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical risk:** Estoppels that fail to list all lease amendments. Undisclosed side letters or amendments granting tenant rights (free rent, early termination, expansion options) are among the most common post-closing surprises in commercial real estate.
- **High risk:** Estoppels that omit TI completion confirmation. Buyer could inherit hundreds of thousands or millions in unfunded TI obligations.
- **Medium risk:** Estoppels that do not address assignment/sublease status, particularly in office properties where sublet space may affect the property's competitive position.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** Add: (a) percentage rent confirmation, (b) co-tenancy requirements and current compliance status, (c) exclusive use provisions, (d) operating covenant confirmation, (e) radius restriction acknowledgment.
- **Office:** Add: (a) parking allocation confirmation, (b) building-specific amenity commitments, (c) signage rights.
- **Industrial:** Add: (a) environmental compliance confirmation regarding tenant's use of hazardous materials, (b) equipment and fixtures identification (what is tenant's vs. landlord's), (c) yard/trailer parking allocation.
- **Data Center:** Add: (a) power allocation and pricing, (b) cooling capacity commitments, (c) redundancy/uptime SLA confirmation, (d) interconnection and fiber rights.
- **Multifamily (commercial tenants):** Standard commercial form plus confirmation of any exclusive arrangements, signage rights, and operating hour commitments.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** The NY Checklist references "a negotiated form of estoppel the tenants must complete" with specific dating and delivery requirements.
- **All jurisdictions:** Confirm that the estoppel form complies with any estoppel-cooperation clause in the lease itself. If the lease specifies required estoppel content, ensure the PSA form does not exceed what the lease permits the landlord to demand, or the tenant will have grounds to refuse.

## 4. Estoppel Delivery Deadline

### Preferred Position

Estoppels should be delivered to buyer no later than **10 business days before the scheduled closing date**. This gives buyer and its counsel adequate time to review, identify variances, and determine whether the estoppel requirement has been satisfied. The NY Checklist recommends "five or ten business days before the closing." Buyer should push for ten.

The process timeline should be:
1. **Within 10 business days after effective date:** Seller delivers draft estoppel certificates to buyer for review (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 7.1)
2. **Within 10 business days after receipt:** Buyer reviews and approves or objects to drafts (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 7.1)
3. **Upon approval:** Seller delivers approved estoppels to tenants
4. **Tenant response period:** Per lease terms, or if not specified, within 10-15 days
5. **Within 2 business days of receipt:** Seller forwards executed estoppels to buyer (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 7.1)
6. **No later than 10 business days before closing:** All required estoppels must be in buyer's possession

The UNICO Buyer Side form also defines an "Estoppel Deadline" (Section 1.8) as a specific date, "as may be extended by operation of Section 7.1," which provides additional certainty.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Draft review right:** The UNICO forms give buyer the right to review draft estoppels before they go to tenants. This is critical to ensure the drafts are accurate and complete. The UNICO Seller Side form shortens buyer's review period to 3 business days (vs. 10 in the buyer side form); push for at least 5-7 business days.
- **Seller's forwarding obligation:** Require seller to forward executed estoppels to buyer within 2 business days of receipt (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 7.1). Do not allow seller to warehouse executed estoppels.
- **Hard deadline vs. floating deadline:** A hard calendar date (the "Estoppel Deadline" in the UNICO form) is cleaner than a floating deadline tied to "X days before closing" because closing itself may be subject to extensions.
- **Deemed approval:** The UNICO forms provide that buyer is "deemed to have approved" draft estoppels if buyer does not object within the specified period. This is acceptable but buyer must calendar the deadline carefully.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Seller will push for: (a) a shorter pre-closing delivery window (5 business days or less), (b) eliminating buyer's right to review drafts, (c) a longer deemed-approval window, and (d) the right to deliver estoppels up to (or even at) closing.

**Fallback chain:**
1. **Best position:** 10 business days before closing, with draft review right
2. **First fallback:** 7 business days before closing, with draft review right
3. **Second fallback:** 5 business days before closing, with draft review right
4. **Third fallback:** 5 business days before closing, without formal draft review (but buyer retains right to object to nonconforming estoppels)
5. **Floor position:** At or before closing -- but this eliminates buyer's ability to assess and creates enormous closing-table pressure. Avoid if possible.

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk:** Accepting estoppel delivery at closing. Buyer loses the ability to review for variances and may be forced to waive defects under time pressure.
- **Medium risk:** Accepting a 5-business-day window without draft review rights.
- **Low risk:** Accepting a 7-business-day window with draft review rights on a property with a small number of tenants.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** Longer lead time needed (10+ business days) because retail tenants (especially national chains) have notoriously slow corporate approval processes for estoppels.
- **Office:** 7-10 business days is standard and achievable for most corporate tenants.
- **Industrial:** Single-tenant or few-tenant properties may need less lead time.
- **Multifamily:** Not applicable for residential units; commercial tenants follow standard timelines.
- **Data Center:** Hyperscale tenants may require 15-20 business days due to corporate legal review processes. Build in extra time.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** The NY Checklist specifically recommends "not more than 30 days before the closing" for the estoppel date and "five or ten business days before the closing" for delivery to buyer.
- **California:** Standard practice is 10 business days before closing for delivery.
- **Multi-state:** For portfolio transactions, set a single estoppel deadline for all properties rather than property-specific deadlines.

## 5. Consequences of Non-Delivery

### Preferred Position

Failure to satisfy the estoppel requirement by the Estoppel Deadline should give buyer the right to **terminate the agreement and receive a full return of the earnest money deposit**, plus a right to extend closing to allow additional time for estoppel collection. The UNICO Buyer Side form structures estoppel delivery as a **closing condition** (Section 10.1.3), and failure of a closing condition triggers buyer's right to terminate and receive the deposit (Section 10.1).

The consequence framework should be:

1. **Closing condition not met:** Buyer may (a) extend closing one time for up to 14 days for seller to continue pursuing estoppels, or (b) terminate and receive deposit, or (c) waive the condition and close
2. **Seller not in default for tenant non-compliance:** The UNICO forms correctly provide that "Seller shall not be in default if any Tenant does not execute and deliver an estoppel certificate" so long as seller has complied with its estoppel-pursuit obligations. This is reasonable because seller cannot force tenants to sign.
3. **But seller IS in default if seller fails to pursue:** Seller's failure to timely request estoppels, to deliver drafts for buyer review, or to forward executed estoppels should constitute a seller default.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Closing condition vs. covenant only:** This is the most heavily negotiated distinction. A **closing condition** (UNICO Buyer Side approach) gives buyer the right to walk away with deposit if estoppels are not obtained. A mere **covenant** (seller agrees to "use commercially reasonable efforts" but failure is not a closing condition) gives buyer only a breach-of-covenant claim. Always insist on closing condition status.
- **Seller's effort standard:** "Commercially reasonable efforts" (UNICO Seller Side, Section 7.1; Meadows, Section 6.1) vs. "good faith, diligent efforts" (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 7.1 cure provisions). Push for "good faith, diligent efforts" at minimum. The detailed seller-side PSA uses "good faith efforts" (Section 6.1(a)(iv)).
- **Closing extension for estoppel pursuit:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 7.1) gives seller a 14-day extension right to cure nonconforming estoppels, and buyer a separate 14-day extension right. The detailed seller-side PSA gives seller up to 60 days of extensions (Section 6.1(b)). Buyer should have its own extension right (separate from seller's) to accommodate estoppel-pursuit timelines.
- **Interaction with earnest money going hard:** On many deals, the deposit goes hard (non-refundable) after the due diligence period. Buyer's termination right for estoppel failure must be carved out from the deposit-going-hard provision.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Fallback chain:**
1. **Best position:** Estoppels as a hard closing condition + buyer's right to terminate with deposit return + buyer's right to extend closing up to 14 days + separate seller cure period
2. **First fallback:** Estoppels as a closing condition + buyer's right to terminate with deposit return + seller's right (not buyer's) to extend closing up to 14 days to continue pursuing
3. **Second fallback:** Estoppels as a closing condition + seller may substitute Seller's Estoppel Certificates for up to 10% of GLA (see Section 6 below) + buyer may terminate only if estoppel threshold (including seller certificates) is still not met
4. **Third fallback:** Estoppels as a closing condition for Major Tenants only; other tenants are "commercially reasonable efforts" covenant only
5. **Floor position:** "Commercially reasonable efforts" covenant only, with seller's estoppel certificate as a substitute for all non-responsive tenants -- this effectively removes the estoppel protection entirely and should be rejected unless the deal dynamics compel it

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical risk:** Accepting estoppels as a covenant only (not a closing condition). Buyer has no practical termination right and must close without estoppel protection, then pursue a breach-of-covenant claim post-closing -- which is expensive, uncertain, and may be time-barred by short survival periods.
- **High risk:** Allowing seller unlimited substitution of Seller's Estoppel Certificates without any cap.
- **Medium risk:** Accepting seller's 14-day extension right without buyer's own independent extension right.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** Stronger closing condition protection is warranted because retail tenant estoppels are more difficult to obtain and retail tenants are more likely to have complex lease provisions (co-tenancy, exclusives, percentage rent) that need estoppel confirmation.
- **Office:** Standard closing condition approach with seller extension right is typical.
- **Industrial:** Single-tenant industrial deals should treat the sole tenant's estoppel as an absolute closing condition with no substitute.
- **Multifamily:** Closing condition for commercial tenants; certified rent roll substitute for residential.
- **Data Center:** Hyperscale tenant estoppels should be absolute closing conditions.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** The NY Checklist (Purchaser's Closing Conditions) lists tenant estoppel delivery as a closing condition: "the seller has delivered all required tenant estoppels."
- **Oregon:** The Meadows form treats estoppels from named tenants as a closing condition (Section 7.2).
- **Colorado:** The detailed seller-side PSA (Denver property) structures estoppels as a closing condition with seller's estoppel certificate substitute rights and a 60-day total extension period.

## 6. Seller's Estoppel Certificate as Substitute

### Preferred Position

Buyer should **resist** any provision allowing seller to substitute a Seller's Estoppel Certificate for a missing tenant estoppel, or at minimum strictly limit its use. A seller's certificate carries far less weight than a tenant estoppel because (a) the tenant is not bound by the seller's statements, (b) the seller's knowledge may be limited, (c) the seller has a financial incentive to close and may be less forthcoming about adverse matters, and (d) most lenders will not accept seller certificates in lieu of tenant estoppels for underwriting purposes.

If seller's estoppel certificates must be accepted, the following limits should apply:

1. **Never for Major Tenants:** Seller's certificates should never be permitted as a substitute for any Major Tenant estoppel
2. **Cap on usage:** Seller's certificates should be limited to no more than 10% of the total GLA threshold (e.g., if the threshold is 80% of GLA, seller may cover at most 10% through seller certificates, meaning at least 70% must come from actual tenant estoppels)
3. **Content parity:** The seller's certificate must contain all the same information as a tenant estoppel (see the detailed seller-side PSA Exhibit B-1 for a comprehensive seller estoppel form)
4. **Survival of representations:** The statements in the seller's estoppel certificate must survive closing with the same survival period as seller's other representations and warranties, and must be subject to the same indemnification cap
5. **Replacement obligation:** Seller must continue to pursue the missing tenant estoppel after closing and must deliver it to buyer upon receipt, with the seller's certificate liability terminating to the extent the tenant estoppel is consistent

### Key Negotiation Points

- **The detailed seller-side PSA approach (Section 6.1(a)(iv))** is the most seller-favorable treatment in the precedents: Seller may substitute seller's certificates for "up to one-half (by number) of the Major Tenants" and all non-major tenants necessary to meet the threshold. This is aggressive and buyer should push back hard.
- **Seller's estoppel form:** The detailed seller-side PSA Exhibit B-1 provides a sophisticated seller estoppel form that includes important buyer protections: (a) the seller's liability is "subject to all time, dollar and other limitations on Seller's liability set forth in the Purchase Agreement," (b) knowledge qualifiers apply, and (c) no officer/director/agent personal liability. If forced to accept seller certificates, negotiate the seller estoppel form to minimize these limitations.
- **Post-closing pursuit:** Require seller to continue pursuing tenant estoppels post-closing and to be released from seller certificate liability only to the extent the tenant's estoppel is consistent with the seller's certificate. The detailed seller-side PSA (Section 6.1(a)(iv)) includes this mechanism.
- **Lender acceptance:** Even if buyer accepts seller certificates, buyer's lender may not. The PSA should provide that buyer's obligation to accept seller certificates is contingent on buyer's lender accepting them.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Fallback chain:**
1. **Best position:** No seller estoppel certificates permitted
2. **First fallback:** Seller certificates permitted for non-Major Tenants only, capped at 5% of GLA, with full survival
3. **Second fallback:** Seller certificates permitted for non-Major Tenants only, capped at 10% of GLA, with full survival and post-closing pursuit obligation
4. **Third fallback:** Seller certificates permitted for non-Major Tenants only, capped at 15% of GLA (but never for Major Tenants)
5. **Floor position:** Seller certificates permitted for up to one-half of Major Tenants (by number, not GLA) plus non-Major Tenants as needed -- only if buyer is in a weak negotiating position or the deal dynamics require it

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical risk:** Accepting seller certificates for Major Tenants without any cap. This eliminates the primary purpose of the estoppel closing condition.
- **High risk:** Accepting seller certificates without a survival period, or with a survival period shorter than the general rep survival.
- **Medium risk:** Accepting seller certificates for non-Major Tenants with appropriate caps and survival.
- **Low risk:** Accepting seller certificates for small tenants (less than 2,500 SF) in a multi-tenant property with full survival.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Single-tenant NNN:** Seller estoppel substitute should be completely rejected. The entire deal risk is on one tenant.
- **Retail:** Seller certificates for anchor tenants should be rejected; acceptable for small inline tenants only.
- **Office:** Acceptable for small tenants, never for credit-tenant floors.
- **Industrial:** Never acceptable for single-tenant; limited acceptance for multi-tenant.
- **Data Center:** Never acceptable for hyperscale tenants; may be acceptable for smaller colocation tenants.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Colorado:** The detailed seller-side PSA (Denver property) includes the most comprehensive seller estoppel mechanism in the precedents, including a separate Exhibit B-1 form.
- **Oregon:** The Meadows form does not include a seller estoppel substitute provision.
- **New York:** Seller estoppel certificates are recognized in NY practice but sophisticated buyers resist them.

## 7. Material Variance in Estoppel

### Preferred Position

The PSA should define what constitutes a "material variance" in an estoppel and specify the consequences. The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 7.1) provides the best buyer-side framework:

**Definition of nonconforming estoppel:** An estoppel that "discloses any material matter that is inconsistent with the Due Diligence Materials (including the Leases), or any representations and warranties made by Seller" is a "Nonconforming Tenant Estoppel."

**Buyer's response:** Buyer has 5 business days after receipt to object and designate the estoppel as nonconforming.

**Seller's cure obligation:** Seller must use "good faith, diligent efforts" to cause the inconsistent matters to be corrected or deleted.

**Consequences if not cured:**
1. Seller may postpone closing up to 14 days to attempt cure
2. Buyer may elect to: (a) postpone closing one time for up to 14 days, (b) terminate and receive deposit, or (c) close despite the variance without purchase price reduction
3. If buyer elects option (a) and seller still cannot cure, buyer may then elect option (b) or (c)

### Key Negotiation Points

- **What is "material"?** The PSA should define material variance. At minimum, the following should be material: (a) disclosure of a landlord default not previously known to buyer, (b) rent amount differing by more than 3-5% from the rent roll, (c) lease term differing by more than 6 months, (d) security deposit amount differing by more than 10%, (e) disclosure of unresolved claims or offsets, (f) disclosure of undisclosed lease amendments or modifications, (g) disclosure of undisclosed renewal options, expansion rights, or purchase options, (h) disclosure of undisclosed subleases or assignments.
- **Buyer's objection window:** The UNICO Buyer Side form gives buyer 5 business days. Push for 5-7 business days. The detailed seller-side PSA gives buyer only 2 business days, which is too short for thorough review on a complex multi-tenant property.
- **Deemed approval trap:** Both the UNICO forms and the detailed seller-side PSA provide that if buyer does not timely object, the estoppel is "deemed" conforming. Buyer must calendar these deadlines rigorously.
- **Purchase price adjustment:** Buyer should push for the right to a purchase price reduction (not just a termination right) if a material variance reduces the economic value of the property. The UNICO Buyer Side form does not include this -- it offers only termination or close-as-is. Consider adding a price adjustment mechanism for quantifiable variances (e.g., if the estoppel reveals a free rent period not disclosed in the rent roll, buyer receives a credit equal to the free rent).
- **Variance vs. estoppel rejection:** Distinguish between (a) an estoppel that is nonconforming because of a variance, and (b) an estoppel that should not count toward the threshold. The detailed seller-side PSA (Section 6.1(a)(iv)) addresses this: estoppels that disclose material defaults or material inconsistencies with the lease schedule do not count toward the Estoppel Requirement unless the inconsistency "was disclosed to Purchaser before the end of the Study Period" or "cannot reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Fallback chain:**
1. **Best position:** Buyer has right to terminate, extend closing, or demand price adjustment for any material variance
2. **First fallback:** Buyer has right to terminate or close-as-is (no price adjustment), with 5+ business day objection window
3. **Second fallback:** Buyer has right to terminate or close-as-is, with 3 business day objection window
4. **Third fallback:** Only variances constituting a Material Adverse Effect give buyer termination rights; lesser variances are close-as-is only
5. **Floor position:** Estoppel-disclosed information modifies seller's representations (the detailed seller-side PSA approach: "the Seller Representation shall be deemed modified by the information contained in such estoppel certificate") -- this effectively eliminates buyer's termination right for estoppel variances

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical risk:** Accepting the "deemed modification" approach from the detailed seller-side PSA without any termination right. This means estoppels can reveal adverse information that retroactively modifies seller's reps, leaving buyer with no remedy.
- **High risk:** Accepting a 2-business-day objection window on a property with 20+ tenants where estoppels may arrive in batches.
- **Medium risk:** Accepting a Material Adverse Effect threshold for termination rights -- "material adverse effect" is a high bar and may not cover individual tenant variances.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** Define material variance to include changes to co-tenancy triggers, exclusive use violations, and percentage rent breakpoints. A retail tenant's estoppel revealing a co-tenancy right failure could justify termination.
- **Office:** Focus on TI completion, rent escalation schedules, and expansion option timing.
- **Industrial:** Focus on environmental representations, use restrictions, and lease term.
- **Data Center:** Focus on power pricing, SLA commitments, and interconnection rights.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** The NY Checklist recommends reserving the right to terminate if an estoppel "discloses material defaults or adverse facts" or "previously undisclosed lease documents."
- **Colorado:** The detailed seller-side PSA provides the most sophisticated variance framework, including the "deemed modification" mechanism and distinction between pre-study-period and post-study-period estoppels.

---

## 8. Estoppel Dating Requirements

### Preferred Position

All estoppels must be dated **no more than 30 days before the scheduled closing date**. The NY Checklist specifically recommends: estoppels "dated not more than 30 days before the closing." This ensures the information is current as of closing.

Additionally:
- If closing is extended for any reason, any estoppel more than 30 days old at the new closing date should be refreshed (re-dated or replaced)
- The detailed seller-side PSA's provision deeming pre-study-period estoppels as "conclusively" counting toward the Estoppel Requirement should be rejected or limited to estoppels that are re-confirmed or brought down within 30 days of closing

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Refreshment obligation on extension:** If closing extends by 30+ days, seller should be obligated to seek updated estoppels. This is particularly important in deals with multiple extension rights.
- **Pre-study-period estoppels:** The detailed seller-side PSA allows estoppels delivered during the study period to count permanently. This is problematic on a long-duration deal where 3-6 months may pass between study period and closing. Push for a freshness requirement.
- **Bring-down certificates:** As an alternative to fully refreshing stale estoppels, consider a mechanism where the tenant confirms in a brief "bring-down" certificate that the prior estoppel remains accurate.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Fallback chain:**
1. **Best position:** All estoppels dated within 30 days of closing, with refresh obligation on extension
2. **First fallback:** All estoppels dated within 45 days of closing
3. **Second fallback:** All estoppels dated within 60 days of closing
4. **Third fallback:** Pre-study-period estoppels accepted if seller provides a bring-down certificate confirming no changes
5. **Floor position:** No dating requirement, but buyer may object to any estoppel that discloses stale or changed information

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk:** Accepting estoppels that are more than 60 days old without any bring-down mechanism. Material changes (tenant defaults, lease modifications, new claims) can occur in this window.
- **Medium risk:** Accepting 45-60 day estoppels on a stable property with no known tenant issues.
- **Low risk:** Accepting 30-day estoppels even without a formal dating requirement if closing is imminent.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** Stricter dating requirements due to retail sector volatility (store closures, co-tenancy failures, bankruptcy filings).
- **Office:** 30-day standard is achievable and appropriate.
- **Industrial:** 30-45 days acceptable for stable industrial tenants.
- **Multifamily:** Commercial tenant estoppels follow standard 30-day rule.
- **Data Center:** 30 days, given the rapidly evolving nature of data center tenant requirements.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** 30-day standard per the NY Checklist.
- **All jurisdictions:** No jurisdiction imposes a statutory dating requirement, so this is entirely contractual.

## 9. SNDA Requirements for Buyer's Lender

### Preferred Position

If buyer is financing the acquisition (which is the assumed context for this playbook, even without a financing contingency), the PSA should require seller to use **reasonable efforts** to deliver executed subordination, non-disturbance, and attornment agreements (SNDAs) from specified tenants before closing. The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 9.3) addresses this: "Such cooperation shall include requesting financial information, estoppel certificates and/or SNDAs from the Tenants, enforcing such requirements for estoppel certificates and SNDAs to the extent the same may be required under the Leases."

The NY Checklist provides: "If the purchaser is financing the purchase of the property, identify the tenants the purchaser's lender will require to enter into a subordination, non-disturbance, and attornment agreement (SNDA). Specify that the seller must use reasonable efforts to deliver an SNDA from the required tenants before closing."

**SNDA requirements should include:**
1. **Identification of required SNDA tenants:** All Major Tenants plus any tenant whose lease is not subordinate to buyer's mortgage by its terms or by a recorded subordination agreement
2. **Form of SNDA:** Buyer's lender's form, or a form reasonably acceptable to buyer's lender
3. **Seller's obligation:** Use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain SNDAs, including enforcing any lease provisions requiring tenant cooperation with SNDAs
4. **Timing:** SNDAs should be requested concurrently with estoppels and delivered no later than the estoppel deadline
5. **Closing condition status:** Whether SNDAs are a closing condition is heavily negotiated (see below)

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Closing condition vs. seller covenant:** Because buyer has assumed no financing contingency, making SNDAs a hard closing condition is difficult to negotiate. The UNICO Buyer Side form explicitly states: "Buyer's ability to obtain financing for the acquisition of the Property is not a condition to Buyer's obligation to close." This means buyer has accepted closing risk if lender-required SNDAs are not obtained. However, buyer should negotiate that seller's obligation to cooperate with SNDA requests is a covenant, and seller's failure to cooperate (not the tenant's failure to sign) is a default.
- **Lease subordination provisions:** Many institutional leases already contain subordination provisions (either automatic subordination or subordination conditioned on non-disturbance protection). If the lease is already subordinate, an SNDA may be unnecessary for subordination but may still be required by the lender for the non-disturbance and attornment provisions.
- **Cost allocation:** SNDA negotiation can be expensive, particularly with national credit tenants whose counsel insists on modifying the lender's form. The PSA should allocate SNDA costs. Typically, buyer (as the party benefiting from financing) bears SNDA negotiation costs, but seller should bear costs of enforcing lease-required SNDA cooperation.
- **The Seller-income-property form (Section 8)** provides a more limited SNDA obligation: seller agrees to "cooperate with Buyer to obtain subordination agreements from tenants" only "provided said tenants' leases permit the landlord to request a subordination agreement" and "Seller shall have no obligation to obtain and deliver any such subordination agreements." This is the seller's preferred position and should be pushed back on.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Fallback chain:**
1. **Best position:** SNDAs from all Major Tenants as a closing condition; seller uses good faith efforts to obtain SNDAs from all other tenants
2. **First fallback:** SNDAs as a seller covenant (not a closing condition) with "commercially reasonable efforts" standard, including enforcing lease-required cooperation
3. **Second fallback:** Seller cooperates in requesting SNDAs but has no obligation to enforce lease provisions or negotiate with tenants
4. **Third fallback:** Seller requests SNDAs concurrently with estoppels but has no further obligation; buyer bears all costs
5. **Floor position:** Seller has no SNDA obligation; buyer handles SNDAs post-closing -- this is unacceptable for any financed transaction

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical risk:** No SNDA provisions in the PSA at all. Buyer may be unable to close financing if lender requires SNDAs from key tenants.
- **High risk:** SNDAs treated as "no obligation" on seller (the Seller-income-property form approach). Buyer is left to negotiate SNDAs post-closing when it has less leverage.
- **Medium risk:** SNDAs as a covenant with reasonable efforts standard. Buyer has a claim against seller for non-cooperation but no right to walk away.
- **Low risk:** SNDAs from all tenants whose leases already require SNDA cooperation.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** Anchor tenant SNDAs are typically the most critical and the most heavily negotiated. National retailers often have their own SNDA forms.
- **Office:** Credit tenant SNDAs are important for CMBS/agency financing. GSA (government) tenants have specific subordination requirements.
- **Industrial:** Single-tenant SNDA is typically a lender hard requirement.
- **Data Center:** Hyperscale tenant SNDAs are essential. These tenants have substantial leverage and their own SNDA forms.
- **Multifamily:** SNDAs are typically not required for residential tenants (residential leases are subordinate by operation of law in most jurisdictions). Commercial tenants within the property require SNDAs.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** The NY Checklist specifically addresses SNDA requirements and recommends identifying required SNDA tenants in the PSA.
- **California:** California Civil Code Section 1946 and related provisions may affect subordination analysis.
- **Texas:** Texas Property Code provisions on landlord liens may interact with SNDA requirements.
- **Oregon:** The Meadows form does not address SNDAs at all, which is a gap in a seller-skewed form.

## 10. SNDA Form and Negotiation

### Preferred Position

Buyer should negotiate the SNDA form early in the transaction -- ideally during due diligence -- and attach the approved form as an exhibit to the PSA (or at minimum, have the lender's form available). The SNDA should be in the **lender's standard form**, with the following tenant protections that buyer should pre-approve to facilitate execution:

1. **Non-disturbance:** Tenant's possession will not be disturbed so long as tenant is not in default
2. **Attornment:** Tenant will attorn to the lender (or purchaser at foreclosure sale)
3. **Lender not bound by certain landlord obligations:** Standard lender carve-outs (lender not liable for prior acts of landlord, not bound by prepaid rent beyond one month, not bound by lease modifications without lender consent)
4. **Tenant notice and cure rights:** Tenant may give lender notice of landlord default and lender has opportunity to cure before tenant exercises remedies

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Pre-negotiation with lender:** Before executing the PSA, buyer should confirm with its lender which tenants require SNDAs and obtain the lender's approved SNDA form. This avoids surprises at closing.
- **Tenant SNDA markup process:** Major credit tenants (especially national retailers, government agencies, and tech companies) will insist on marking up the lender's form. The PSA should allocate time for this negotiation and specify that seller will cooperate in facilitating discussions between the lender and tenants.
- **Lease-form SNDAs:** Some leases contain an SNDA form as an exhibit. If the lease-form SNDA is acceptable to the lender, use it to avoid negotiation delays.
- **Recording:** SNDAs should be recorded in the applicable real property records. The PSA should specify which party is responsible for recording and who bears recording costs.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Seller will argue that SNDA negotiation between buyer's lender and tenants is not seller's responsibility. The practical reality is that seller has the landlord-tenant relationship and can facilitate introductions.

**Fallback chain:**
1. **Best position:** Lender's form SNDA attached as exhibit; seller required to request execution from all identified tenants
2. **First fallback:** Lender's form SNDA; seller facilitates introductions between lender and tenants
3. **Second fallback:** Lease-form SNDA used where available; lender's form for others
4. **Floor position:** Buyer handles all SNDA negotiation directly with tenants post-closing

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk:** Attempting to negotiate complex SNDA markups between closing and the SNDA delivery deadline. This commonly causes closing delays.
- **Medium risk:** Using lease-form SNDAs without confirming lender acceptance.
- **Low risk:** Pre-negotiated SNDA forms with known credit tenants.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** National retailers (Home Depot, Walmart, Target) have their own SNDA forms that they will not negotiate. Confirm lender acceptance of the tenant's form before PSA execution.
- **Office:** Corporate tenants are generally more flexible on SNDA forms.
- **Industrial:** Single-tenant deals make the SNDA negotiation a bilateral discussion.
- **Data Center:** Hyperscale tenants have their own SNDA forms with extensive modifications. Budget significant time and legal cost.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** SNDA recording fees and mortgage recording tax implications should be considered.
- **California:** California anti-deficiency protections may affect SNDA language.
- **All jurisdictions:** Confirm that the SNDA form complies with local recording requirements (acknowledgment, notarization, witness requirements).

## 11. Closing Extension Rights for Estoppel/SNDA Delivery

### Preferred Position

The PSA should provide **mutual extension rights** tied to estoppel and SNDA delivery:

1. **Buyer's extension right:** If the estoppel requirement is not met by the Estoppel Deadline, buyer may extend closing by up to 14-21 days (without additional deposit) to allow seller additional time to obtain estoppels
2. **Seller's extension right:** Seller may extend closing by up to 14 days to cure nonconforming estoppels or obtain missing estoppels
3. **Combined cap:** Total extensions for estoppel/SNDA purposes should not exceed 30 days

The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 7.1) provides a 14-day seller cure period for nonconforming estoppels, plus a separate 14-day buyer postponement right. The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 11.2.2) also provides a general buyer extension right of up to 20 business days (with additional deposit).

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Extension without additional deposit:** Buyer should not be required to increase the deposit for estoppel-related extensions. The delay is caused by third-party tenants, not buyer.
- **Outside date:** Even with extensions, there should be an outside date after which either party may terminate. The detailed seller-side PSA allows seller to extend for up to 60 days total (Section 6.1(b)), which is excessively long.
- **Automatic vs. elective:** Extensions should be elective (party chooses to extend) rather than automatic. Buyer should always retain the right to terminate in lieu of extending.
- **Interaction with other extensions:** Estoppel extension rights should be in addition to any general closing extension rights (e.g., for title cure, loan assumption).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Fallback chain:**
1. **Best position:** Mutual extension rights (14 days each, 30-day cap), no additional deposit required
2. **First fallback:** Buyer extension of 14 days + seller extension of 14 days, small additional deposit ($25,000-$50,000)
3. **Second fallback:** Seller extension only (14 days) + buyer terminates if still not met after extension
4. **Third fallback:** No specific estoppel extension; rely on general closing extension provisions
5. **Floor position:** No extension rights; estoppel condition must be met by original closing date or buyer terminates

### Risk Assessment

- **Medium risk:** Excessive extension periods (60+ days) that delay closing and create uncertainty.
- **Medium risk:** No extension rights at all, forcing a premature termination decision.
- **Low risk:** Reasonable mutual extensions (14-21 days each) with a 30-day cap.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** Longer extensions may be needed (21 days per party) due to national tenant corporate approval timelines.
- **Office:** 14-day extensions are generally sufficient.
- **Industrial:** Shorter extensions (7-14 days) for properties with few tenants.
- **Data Center:** Longer extensions (21 days) for hyperscale tenant SNDA negotiation.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Extension provisions are purely contractual. No jurisdictional restrictions apply, but be mindful of rate-lock expiration on buyer's financing.

## 12. Seller's Obligations to Request and Pursue Estoppels

### Preferred Position

Seller's obligations should include the following specific procedural requirements, drawn from the UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 7.1):

1. **Draft preparation and delivery:** Seller delivers draft estoppel certificates to buyer in electronic format within 10 business days after the effective date
2. **Buyer review:** Buyer has 10 business days to review and approve or object to drafts
3. **Distribution to tenants:** Seller delivers approved estoppels to each tenant promptly after buyer approval (or deemed approval)
4. **Lease enforcement:** Seller asks each tenant to execute within the time period required by the lease, or if no period is specified, within 10 days
5. **Forwarding:** Within 2 business days after receipt, seller forwards executed estoppels to buyer
6. **Follow-up:** Seller shall use good faith, diligent efforts to follow up with non-responsive tenants and shall provide buyer with status updates at least weekly
7. **Records:** Seller shall provide buyer with copies of all estoppel requests, follow-up correspondence, and responses

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Effort standard:** "Good faith, diligent efforts" (stronger) vs. "commercially reasonable efforts" (standard) vs. "reasonable efforts" (weaker). Push for "good faith, diligent efforts" or at least "commercially reasonable efforts."
- **No default for tenant non-compliance:** Both UNICO forms provide that "Seller shall not be in default if any Tenant does not execute and deliver an estoppel certificate" provided seller has complied with the procedural requirements. This is reasonable and market.
- **Lease enforcement:** If the lease contains an estoppel cooperation clause with a specific time period, seller should be required to enforce it, including by sending default notices if the tenant fails to comply. The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 9.3) requires seller to "enforce such requirements for estoppel certificates and SNDAs to the extent the same may be required under the Leases (but without any need to file claims or incur substantial costs)."
- **Seller cooperation with buyer's direct outreach:** Buyer should reserve the right to contact tenants directly regarding estoppels (with seller's knowledge) if seller's efforts are unsuccessful.
- **Status reporting:** Require seller to provide weekly status updates on estoppel pursuit, including identification of responsive and non-responsive tenants.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Fallback chain:**
1. **Best position:** Full procedural obligations as outlined above, "good faith, diligent efforts" standard, lease enforcement obligation, weekly reporting
2. **First fallback:** Same procedural obligations, "commercially reasonable efforts" standard, lease enforcement short of litigation
3. **Second fallback:** Seller requests estoppels from all tenants and forwards results; no specific follow-up or reporting obligations
4. **Third fallback:** Seller requests estoppels and uses reasonable efforts; no default for any failure
5. **Floor position:** Seller cooperates with buyer's estoppel requests but has no independent obligation to pursue

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk:** Vague effort standards without procedural specifics. "Reasonable efforts" without defined steps is effectively unenforceable.
- **Medium risk:** No reporting obligation, leaving buyer in the dark about estoppel status until the deadline.
- **Low risk:** Detailed procedural obligations with regular reporting, even under a "commercially reasonable efforts" standard.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** More active seller involvement needed; retail property managers often have established relationships with tenant store managers that facilitate estoppel execution.
- **Office:** Standard approach; property management companies typically handle estoppel requests efficiently.
- **Industrial:** Fewer tenants means more focused pursuit; seller should have no excuse for not pursuing aggressively.
- **Multifamily:** Commercial tenant estoppels follow standard approach; residential units do not require individual estoppels.
- **Data Center:** Seller should facilitate introductions to tenant legal contacts and participate in SNDA/estoppel discussions.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Seller's obligation to pursue estoppels is purely contractual. There is no statutory obligation on a landlord to request estoppels from tenants (though many leases contain tenant estoppel cooperation clauses).

---

## 13. Allocation of Estoppel Risk

### Preferred Position

The risk allocation framework should distinguish between:

1. **Tenant non-response risk:** This is shared. Seller bears the obligation to pursue diligently. If seller complies with all procedural obligations and the tenant still does not respond, this is not seller's default, but the closing condition is still not met and buyer may terminate.
2. **Variance risk:** This is primarily seller's risk. If an estoppel reveals information inconsistent with seller's representations or the due diligence materials, seller must cure or buyer may terminate.
3. **Stale information risk:** This is seller's risk. Seller must ensure estoppels are current.
4. **Form compliance risk:** This is shared. Seller must deliver the approved form to tenants; if the tenant insists on modifications, seller must work with the tenant and buyer to resolve.
5. **SNDA risk:** In a no-financing-contingency deal, SNDA risk ultimately falls on buyer (buyer has agreed to close regardless of financing). However, seller bears the risk of non-cooperation with SNDA requests.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **The "no default" shield:** The UNICO forms and the detailed seller-side PSA all protect seller from being in "default" if tenants do not respond, provided seller has complied with its obligations. This is a critical distinction: seller is not in default (so buyer cannot pursue default remedies), but the closing condition may still fail (so buyer can terminate).
- **Interaction with reps and warranties:** If an estoppel reveals information inconsistent with seller's reps, the detailed seller-side PSA provides that seller's reps are "deemed modified" by the estoppel. Buyer should resist this or at minimum preserve a termination right for material modifications.
- **Post-closing claims:** If an estoppel is not obtained before closing and buyer closes anyway (waiving the condition), buyer should preserve the right to make claims under seller's reps and warranties if post-closing facts reveal that the lease status was different from seller's representations.
- **Indemnification:** Consider a specific indemnification provision where seller indemnifies buyer for losses arising from inaccuracies in any Seller's Estoppel Certificate or from lease matters not disclosed in the estoppel process.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Risk allocation is ultimately a function of deal leverage and asset quality. In a competitive bidding situation, buyer may need to accept more estoppel risk. In a negotiated off-market deal, buyer has more leverage to allocate risk to seller.

**Fallback chain for variance risk:**
1. **Best position:** Seller indemnifies buyer for all losses arising from estoppel variances; seller's reps survive closing for 12 months
2. **First fallback:** Seller indemnifies buyer for variances from Seller's Estoppel Certificates; tenant estoppel variances modify seller's reps (detailed seller-side PSA approach) but buyer retains termination right for Material Adverse Effect
3. **Second fallback:** Estoppel variances modify seller's reps; buyer may terminate only for Material Adverse Effect; no post-closing indemnification
4. **Floor position:** Buyer accepts all estoppel risk; closing waives all estoppel-related claims

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical risk:** Accepting full estoppel risk waiver at closing without any post-closing protection.
- **High risk:** Allowing estoppel information to retroactively modify seller's reps without any termination right or indemnification.
- **Medium risk:** Standard risk allocation where seller's estoppel certificates carry indemnification but tenant estoppels modify reps.
- **Low risk:** Full buyer protection with seller indemnification and survival -- achievable in buyer's market or off-market deals.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Single-tenant:** All estoppel risk is concentrated. Buyer needs maximum protection.
- **Multi-tenant (diversified):** Risk is spread across tenants. More tolerance for standard risk allocation.
- **Retail (anchor-dependent):** Anchor tenant estoppel risk is critical and should carry maximum protection.
- **Data center:** Hyperscale tenant estoppel risk is concentrated and high-value. Maximum protection warranted.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Estoppel risk allocation is a contractual matter. No jurisdiction imposes a particular allocation by statute.
- **New York:** NY courts will enforce the contractual risk allocation, including "deemed modification" provisions and estoppel waiver clauses.
- **Delaware entities:** If seller is a Delaware LLC (as in most of the precedent forms), confirm that estoppel indemnification obligations are enforceable against the entity and any guarantor.
