# Definitions and Property Description — Buyer Playbook

This playbook addresses the Definitions and Property Description provisions of a commercial real estate purchase and sale agreement from the **buyer/purchaser** perspective. It is designed for use by AI agents conducting contract review on behalf of institutional buyers acquiring income-producing commercial real estate.

---

## Property Definition Breadth

### Preferred Position

The Property definition should be as expansive as possible, capturing every asset, right, and interest associated with the real estate. The definition should be structured as an umbrella term that aggregates defined sub-categories, each of which is itself broadly drafted. The buyer's goal is to ensure that everything of value transfers at Closing without the need for separate negotiations or additional consideration.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Property" means, collectively: (a) the Real Property; (b) the Appurtenances; (c) the Improvements; (d) the Personal Property; (e) the Intangible Property; (f) Seller's interest in the Leases; and (g) Seller's interest in the Assumed Contracts.

Each sub-component should then be separately and broadly defined (see sub-sections below).

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the definition uses an aggregating structure (not a single paragraph) so that each component can be independently referenced, assigned, and warranted.
- The "Property" definition should explicitly state it includes "all of Seller's right, title and interest" in each component — not merely "Seller's interest" alone, which could imply less than the totality.
- Confirm the definition does not contain hidden carve-outs or cross-references to exclusion schedules that have not yet been populated.
- Verify the Property definition aligns with what the deed, bill of sale, assignment of leases, and assignment of contracts actually convey at Closing. A mismatch between the PSA Property definition and the closing documents is a common source of post-closing disputes.
- Include a catch-all clause: "and all other rights, privileges, and appurtenances belonging or in any way appertaining to the foregoing."

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The Property definition should be limited to what Seller actually owns and can convey, and should exclude items that belong to third parties (tenants, equipment lessors, property managers).

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept tenant property exclusions and third-party equipment lease exclusions, but require Seller to schedule all such excluded items so the buyer can verify scope during diligence.
2. Accept a narrower Property definition if Seller provides a representation and warranty that the definition captures all assets used in the operation of the Property.
3. If Seller insists on material exclusions (e.g., retaining trade names, websites, software), negotiate a license-back arrangement or a transition services agreement covering such excluded items.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — The Property definition is the foundational provision of the entire PSA. An under-inclusive definition can result in the buyer paying for assets it does not receive, losing operational continuity, or facing title insurance gaps. Every downstream provision (representations, covenants, closing deliveries, prorations) keys off this definition.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Ensure lobby furniture, signage, fitness center equipment, conference room AV systems, and building management systems (BMS/BAS) are captured in Personal Property.
- **Industrial:** Confirm that dock equipment, cranes, hoists, rail spurs, and truck court improvements are included. Verify whether specialized manufacturing equipment belongs to tenant or landlord.
- **Retail:** Confirm pylon signs, monument signs, and common area furnishings are included. For enclosed malls, verify inclusion of common area HVAC, escalators, and food court improvements.
- **Multifamily:** Ensure appliances, fitness equipment, pool furniture, laundry equipment (distinguish owned from leased), and model unit furnishings are captured.
- **Data Center:** Critical to include raised flooring, UPS systems, generators, fuel tanks, CRAC units, fire suppression systems, and structured cabling. Carefully distinguish landlord-owned infrastructure from tenant-installed equipment. Verify whether dark fiber, interconnection agreements, and utility feeds are included.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Western states (CO, NV, AZ, NM, UT, ID, MT, WY, OR, WA):** Water rights may not automatically transfer with real property. Ensure the Property definition explicitly includes all water rights, water shares, ditch rights, and well permits. In Colorado, water rights are severable and separately adjudicated.
- **Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, North Dakota:** Mineral rights are frequently severed from surface estates. The Property definition must expressly address mineral rights, oil and gas rights, and subsurface rights — or confirm they were previously severed and are not available.
- **New York:** Ensure the Property definition includes development rights (air rights/TDRs) which may be separately owned or encumbered.
- **Hawaii:** Leasehold fee structures are common. Verify whether the transaction involves fee simple or leasehold conveyance.

## Real Property (Land and Improvements)

### Preferred Position

The "Real Property" definition should include the land described in the legal description exhibit, together with all rights, privileges, easements, and appurtenances belonging thereto. The buyer should insist on separate, expansive definitions for "Land" and "Improvements."

**Preferred sample language for Land:**

> "Real Property" means that certain real property located at [ADDRESS], [CITY], [STATE], as more particularly described on Exhibit A attached hereto, together with all right, title, and interest of Seller in and to (i) all streets, alleys, passages, rights-of-way, and other appurtenances included in, adjacent to, or used in connection with such land, (ii) all mineral, oil, gas, and other subsurface rights, (iii) all development rights and air rights, and (iv) all water rights.

**Preferred sample language for Improvements:**

> "Improvements" means all buildings, structures, and other improvements situated upon the Real Property, including without limitation: (i) all structures affixed to the Real Property; (ii) all apparatus, equipment, and appliances used in connection with the operation or occupancy of the Real Property; and (iii) all facilities used to provide any services to the Real Property or the structures affixed thereto, excluding those fixtures owned by Tenants or other occupants of the Property or vendors of the Improvements.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The legal description on Exhibit A must match the survey and title commitment. Flag any PSA that does not require a legal description exhibit or that uses only a street address.
- Insist that the definition includes "all right, title and interest" of Seller — not merely "Seller's interest" — to capture after-acquired title.
- Ensure appurtenances are not limited to "easements" but include the full basket: privileges, rights-of-way, strips, gores, development rights, air rights, water rights, and mineral rights.
- Confirm that the Improvements definition captures building systems (HVAC, elevators, electrical, plumbing, fire suppression) and not just "structures."
- The carve-out for tenant-owned fixtures must be limited to items actually owned by tenants under their Leases — not items "claimed" by tenants.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** It cannot warrant title to appurtenances it may not own (e.g., previously severed mineral rights, disputed easement rights). It may also seek to limit the conveyance to a "special warranty deed" rather than a "general warranty deed."

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept a special warranty deed (standard in institutional transactions), but ensure it covers all claims "by, through, or under Seller."
2. Accept that previously severed mineral/subsurface rights are not included, but require Seller to represent that it has not severed any such rights and has no knowledge of prior severances not disclosed in the title commitment.
3. Accept an "Improvements" definition that excludes tenant fixtures, but only if defined by reference to the Leases (not a separate schedule that could be manipulated).

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — The real property description is the core of the conveyance. Any deficiency in the legal description or the scope of appurtenances can create title insurance gaps, survey discrepancies, or post-closing disputes over property boundaries and associated rights.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Industrial:** Confirm inclusion of truck courts, loading docks, rail sidings, and outdoor storage areas. Verify whether adjacent parcels used for parking or staging are included.
- **Retail:** Confirm inclusion of outparcels, pad sites, and common area improvements. For ground-leased pads, clarify what is being conveyed (fee interest, ground lease, or both).
- **Multifamily:** Confirm inclusion of amenity buildings, pool structures, maintenance facilities, and detached garages or carports.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Louisiana:** Real property law follows the civil law tradition. Ensure definitions account for the distinction between immovables and movables rather than the common law real/personal property framework.
- **Community property states (CA, AZ, NV, WA, ID, NM, TX, WI, LA):** If Seller is an individual or entity with individual beneficial owners, ensure spousal consent is obtained or that the entity structure insulates the conveyance.

---

## Appurtenances

### Preferred Position

Appurtenances should be broadly defined and explicitly enumerated to avoid any argument that a particular right does not "run with the land." The definition should capture rights that benefit the Property even if they are not of record.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Appurtenances" means all rights, privileges, easements, rights-of-way, strips, gores, and other appurtenances benefiting, belonging to, or in any way appertaining to the Real Property, including without limitation: (i) all mineral, oil, gas, and other subsurface rights; (ii) all development rights and air rights; (iii) all water rights, water shares, ditch rights, and well permits; (iv) all rights in and to any streets, roads, or alleys abutting or adjacent to the Real Property; and (v) all other rights and benefits running with the Real Property.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Do not allow Appurtenances to be defined merely as "rights, easements and rights-of-way appurtenant to the Real Property" without the additional enumerated categories. A narrow definition can exclude development rights, air rights, mineral rights, and water rights.
- In urban settings, confirm the definition includes rights under any reciprocal easement agreements (REAs), declarations of covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs), and common area maintenance (CAM) agreements.
- For properties benefiting from off-site parking easements, shared access agreements, or utility easements, verify these are captured.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Appurtenances should only include items that legally run with the land, and the definition should not purport to convey items Seller does not own or that require separate assignment.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept a qualifier "to the extent owned by Seller and legally transferable" for items like development rights and air rights, but insist on a representation that Seller has not severed, transferred, or encumbered any such rights.
2. Accept that water rights require separate conveyance instruments (common in western states), but make delivery of such instruments a condition to Closing.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Failure to capture appurtenances can deprive the buyer of valuable property rights that were priced into the acquisition. Development rights and air rights can represent significant unrealized value.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York City:** Air rights (development rights) are separately valuable and transferable. Ensure the PSA addresses zoning lot mergers, TDR certificates, and any restrictive declarations.
- **Colorado:** Water rights are adjudicated separately and may require transfer through the Water Court. Ensure the PSA provides for cooperation in such proceedings.
- **California:** Ensure inclusion of any Proposition 13 base-year tax benefits and any entitlements under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

## Personal Property Inclusions and Exclusions

### Preferred Position

The Personal Property definition should be broadly drafted to capture all tangible personalty used in the operation of the Property. The buyer should insist on (a) a broad definition with specific illustrative examples, (b) a schedule of excluded personal property (rather than a schedule of included property — the burden should be on Seller to identify what it is retaining), and (c) a representation from Seller that the Personal Property is owned free and clear.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Personal Property" means all tangible personal property located on and used in connection with the Real Property or the Improvements (excluding the personal property of Tenants or other occupants of the Property), including but not limited to: furniture, fixtures (to the extent not part of the Improvements), equipment, machinery, supplies, tools, signage, keys, security cards, access systems, and the items described on Exhibit [__] attached hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Personal Property does not include the items identified on Schedule [__] ("Excluded Personal Property").

### Key Negotiation Points

- Insist that the exclusion mechanism uses a **scheduled list of excluded items** rather than a scheduled list of included items. This forces Seller to affirmatively identify what it is retaining, and everything else transfers by default.
- Verify whether Seller is retaining any personal property that is operationally critical (e.g., building management software, proprietary access control systems, maintenance equipment). If so, negotiate a transition plan.
- Require Seller to represent that it owns all Personal Property free and clear of liens and encumbrances (other than Permitted Exceptions) and that no Personal Property is leased from a third party except as scheduled.
- Negotiate a Purchase Price allocation between Real Property and Personal Property for tax purposes (personal property depreciates faster, benefiting the buyer).
- Confirm that the Bill of Sale form at Closing is consistent with the PSA's Personal Property definition.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** It needs to retain certain items used across its portfolio (e.g., proprietary software, management office equipment, branded materials). It may also resist a broad definition to avoid inadvertently conveying items it did not intend to sell.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept a scheduled list of excluded items, but require the schedule to be delivered and finalized before expiration of the due diligence period, and require a representation that the schedule is complete.
2. Accept that management office personal property and branded materials are excluded, but negotiate for Seller to leave in place any items that are integrated into building systems or necessary for ongoing operations.
3. If Seller leases equipment from third parties (e.g., copiers, laundry machines, vending equipment), require Seller to either (a) assign the equipment lease if Buyer elects, or (b) remove the equipment at Seller's expense.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — Personal property disputes rarely threaten the core transaction, but unscheduled exclusions can create operational gaps or surprise costs. The Purchase Price allocation issue has significant tax implications for institutional buyers.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily:** Personal property (appliances, fitness equipment, pool furniture, laundry machines) is typically a larger percentage of overall value. Verify ownership vs. lease status of all laundry equipment (this is the most commonly litigated personal property item in multifamily transactions).
- **Data Center:** The line between real property fixtures and personal property is critical and often contested by tax assessors. Ensure the PSA addresses this allocation clearly.
- **Retail:** Common area personal property (benches, kiosks, holiday decorations, common area signage) should be inventoried.
- **Office:** Building management system (BMS) hardware and software, lobby artwork (may be leased), and security systems warrant specific attention.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **UCC considerations (all states):** Personal property transfers may implicate Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Ensure the PSA includes appropriate UCC representations and that a UCC search is conducted during diligence.
- **Sales/use tax (varies by state):** The allocation of Purchase Price to personal property may trigger sales or use tax. Consult with tax counsel regarding the applicable state's treatment.

---

## Intangible Property

### Preferred Position

The Intangible Property definition should capture all non-tangible assets used in the ownership, operation, and management of the Property. This is frequently under-drafted in seller-side forms and can result in the buyer losing valuable rights.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Intangible Property" means all rights, warranties, guarantees, utility contracts, approvals (governmental or otherwise), permits, certificates of occupancy, surveys, plans and specifications, trademarks or tradenames, copyrights, websites, social media accounts, domain names, telephone exchange numbers, and any agreements, covenants, or indemnifications that Seller received from a third party, including any prior owner, and relating to the Real Property, Appurtenances, or Improvements, in each case to the extent owned by Seller and legally transferable.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Warranties and guarantees:** Ensure the definition captures contractor warranties, manufacturer warranties (especially roof warranties, elevator warranties, and HVAC warranties), and any indemnities received from prior owners (including environmental indemnities).
- **Permits and approvals:** Capture all building permits, certificates of occupancy, zoning approvals, variances, special use permits, and liquor licenses (if applicable). Flag that many permits are non-transferable by law — the PSA should require Seller to cooperate in the transfer or re-issuance process.
- **Plans and specifications:** Ensure as-built drawings, architectural plans, structural drawings, and MEP (mechanical, electrical, plumbing) specifications transfer. These are essential for future tenant improvement work and capital projects.
- **Trade names and branding:** For properties with established names (e.g., "The Prudential Tower," "One Liberty Plaza"), ensure the trade name and associated domain names, social media accounts, and branding materials transfer or are licensed to the buyer.
- **Software and technology:** Building management software, energy management systems, tenant portals, and smart building platforms should be addressed. Many are licensed rather than owned — verify transferability.
- **Transferability qualifier:** Accept "to the extent owned by Seller and legally transferable" but require Seller to represent which Intangible Property items require third-party consent for transfer and to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Many intangible assets are portfolio-level assets (software licenses, property management platform, branded materials) not specific to the Property and should not transfer. Seller may also exclude internal analyses, appraisals, and attorney-client privileged materials.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept exclusion of portfolio-level assets and privileged materials, but require an exhibit listing all such excluded items.
2. Accept that software licenses must be separately negotiated with the licensor, but require Seller to cooperate in the transfer and not terminate or reassign the license prior to Closing.
3. Accept that Seller's management-related intangibles (its property management platform, proprietary operating procedures) do not transfer, but require a reasonable transition period.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Missing intangible property can create significant operational disruption. Warranty assignments are particularly valuable for properties with recently completed capital improvements. Loss of permits or entitlements can impair the buyer's ability to operate or reposition the asset.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Data Center:** Interconnection agreements, fiber IRU (indefeasible right of use) agreements, and power purchase agreements may be the most valuable intangible assets. Ensure these are captured or separately assigned.
- **Retail:** Liquor licenses, signage permits, and naming rights agreements require special attention.
- **Multifamily:** Low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) regulatory agreements, housing authority agreements, and any Section 8 HAP contracts must be addressed.
- **Office:** Energy Star certifications, LEED certifications, and any green building designations should be captured.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All states:** Governmental permits and licenses are typically non-assignable. The PSA should require Seller cooperation in re-issuance rather than purporting to "assign" such items.
- **New York:** Certificates of occupancy are particularly significant and should be a specific closing condition.
- **California:** Entitlements under CEQA, local coastal permits, and Mello-Roos Community Facilities District participation rights may be relevant.

---

## Leases Definition and Scope

### Preferred Position

The Leases definition must be comprehensive and capture all agreements granting possessory rights in the Property, not merely formal "lease" documents. The buyer should insist on a definition that sweeps in all modifications, amendments, guarantees, side letters, work letter agreements, and license agreements.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Leases" means all leases, lease amendments, lease guaranties, work letter agreements, improvement agreements, subleases (to the extent Seller is the sublandlord), license agreements, concessions, and all other agreements creating a possessory interest in the Real Property or Improvements, together with all modifications, supplements, side letters, and addenda thereto, as set forth on Schedule [__] attached hereto, and any new leases or amendments entered into after the Effective Date in accordance with Section [__] of this Agreement.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Comprehensiveness:** Ensure the definition includes guaranties (personal guarantees, corporate guarantees, letters of credit) as part of the "Leases." A common seller tactic is to define "Leases" narrowly and then address guaranties separately — or not at all — leaving the buyer without recourse against guarantors.
- **Schedule requirement:** Insist that all Leases be scheduled, with the schedule updated through Closing. The schedule should identify, at minimum: tenant name, premises, lease commencement and expiration dates, current rent, security deposit amount, and any unperformed landlord obligations (TI allowances, rent abatements).
- **After-acquired leases:** The definition must capture new leases and amendments entered into between signing and Closing that are approved by Buyer under the PSA's leasing covenant.
- **Subleases:** Clarify whether subleases are included in the definition. In most cases, subleases are between the tenant and subtenant and do not create privity with the landlord. The buyer's interest is typically in the master lease, not the sublease. However, if Seller is the sublandlord on any space, those subleases must transfer.
- **License agreements:** Short-term licenses (antenna licenses, ATM licenses, vending machine agreements, temporary use permits) are often omitted from the Lease definition. Ensure they are captured.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The Lease definition should be limited to "leases of space" and should not include ancillary agreements (license agreements, rooftop antenna agreements) which Seller may wish to retain or which may relate to Seller's broader portfolio.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept a narrower Lease definition that excludes licenses and concessions, but require a separate schedule of all non-lease occupancy agreements and negotiate their transfer independently.
2. Accept that guaranties are defined separately from Leases, but require an express assignment of guaranties at Closing and a Seller representation that all guaranties are in full force and effect.
3. If Seller retains any occupancy agreements (e.g., management office space for Seller's property manager), require a formal lease or license on market terms with a definitive expiration date.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — The Leases are the primary income-producing asset being acquired. An incomplete Leases definition can result in lost rental income, unenforceable guarantees, undisclosed landlord obligations, or gaps in the buyer's estoppel and SNDA processes.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Address co-working/flexible space operators (WeWork, Regus) whose agreements may be structured as licenses or management agreements rather than traditional leases.
- **Industrial:** Address ground leases, billboard leases, cell tower leases, and solar panel leases, which are common additional revenue sources on industrial properties.
- **Retail:** Address percentage rent provisions, radius restrictions, co-tenancy clauses, and exclusive use provisions, all of which should be captured in the Lease definition.
- **Multifamily:** Address month-to-month tenancies, corporate housing agreements, and short-term rental (Airbnb-style) arrangements.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Rent-stabilized and rent-controlled tenancies are subject to special regulatory requirements. Ensure the Lease definition and related representations address the regulatory status of each unit.
- **California:** AB 1482 (Tenant Protection Act) and local rent control ordinances impose restrictions on rent increases and terminations. Lease-related representations must address compliance.
- **Oregon:** Statewide rent control (SB 608) applies to most residential tenancies. Address in the Lease definition and representations.

---

## Assumed Contracts Definition and Mechanism

### Preferred Position

The buyer should have maximum control over which service contracts are assumed at Closing. The preferred mechanism is a "negative election" process: all contracts are disclosed, and the buyer designates which contracts it does NOT wish to assume, with Seller responsible for terminating all non-assumed contracts prior to or at Closing.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Assumed Contracts" means those Contracts listed on Exhibit [__] hereto which Buyer has not, prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, designated by written notice to Seller as contracts that Buyer does not wish to assume. Seller shall terminate or cause to be terminated, at Seller's sole cost and expense and effective on or before the Closing Date, all Contracts that are not Assumed Contracts.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Election timing:** Insist that the buyer's right to elect which contracts to assume runs through the due diligence period (not before signing). This allows the buyer to evaluate each contract during diligence.
- **Seller obligation to terminate:** Require Seller to terminate non-assumed contracts at Seller's sole cost and expense. If a contract cannot be terminated without penalty, require Seller to pay such penalty or credit the buyer at Closing.
- **Contracts definition:** Ensure the underlying "Contracts" definition is broad enough to capture all service agreements, maintenance contracts, equipment leases, management agreements, leasing brokerage agreements, and other third-party agreements. Watch for seller-side forms that define "Contracts" narrowly to exclude management agreements and leasing brokerage agreements.
- **Post-signing contracts:** Require Seller to obtain Buyer's prior written consent before entering into any new contract or materially modifying any existing contract after the Effective Date.
- **Management agreement:** Expressly require that Seller's existing property management agreement be terminated at or before Closing at Seller's expense.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Certain contracts are not terminable on short notice or without penalty, and Seller should not bear the cost of early termination for contracts that were disclosed during diligence.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept that Seller's obligation to terminate non-assumed contracts is limited to contracts terminable on 30 days' notice without penalty. For contracts requiring longer notice or penalties, Buyer receives a credit at Closing for the pro-rated cost of the remaining term or the early termination penalty.
2. Accept a "positive election" mechanism (Buyer designates which contracts it wishes to assume) rather than a "negative election," but only if the Contracts schedule is complete and delivered at signing.
3. Accept that Seller is not obligated to terminate its management agreement if the manager has a contractual right to continue through a specified date, but require Seller to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate an early termination and to cooperate with Buyer's transition to a new manager.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Inheriting unfavorable or above-market service contracts can erode net operating income. Failing to terminate management agreements can create operational conflicts. Commission agreements with leasing brokers can create unexpected liabilities.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Parking management agreements, food service contracts, and conference facility management agreements are commonly overlooked.
- **Industrial:** Verify rail service agreements, environmental monitoring contracts, and specialized maintenance agreements (e.g., crane maintenance).
- **Retail:** Common area maintenance (CAM) vendor contracts, marketing fund contracts, and merchant association agreements require attention.
- **Data Center:** Power purchase agreements (PPAs), cooling system maintenance contracts, and interconnection agreements may be critical operational contracts the buyer will want to assume.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- No material jurisdictional variation for the contract assumption mechanism itself. However, the underlying contracts may be governed by different state laws, and termination provisions should be reviewed under the applicable state's contract law.

---

## Business Day Definition

### Preferred Position

The Business Day definition should be clear, objective, and tied to the location of the Property. The buyer should push for a definition that excludes the fewest possible days, to maximize the buyer's time for diligence, title review, and other time-sensitive activities.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday, or any day that is recognized as a holiday under the laws of the state in which the Property is located or under federal law. Unless this Agreement expressly refers to "Business Days," all references to "days" shall mean calendar days.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Resist definitions that exclude days based on conditions at the seller's home jurisdiction when the Property is in a different state. The relevant jurisdiction should be the state where the Property is located.
- Resist expansive definitions that exclude days for "extraordinary events" (hurricanes, power outages, acts of terrorism) — these are force majeure concepts that should be addressed separately, not baked into the Business Day definition.
- Ensure the PSA specifies what happens when a deadline falls on a non-Business Day (typically: extends to the next Business Day). This should be addressed in the Business Day definition itself or in a general construction provision.
- Confirm whether time-of-day references use the Property's local time zone or another time zone. Push for Property-local time.
- Flag the distinction between "Business Days" and "calendar days" — every deadline in the PSA should clearly specify which applies.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The Business Day definition should account for its own business operations location (e.g., if Seller is in Boston but Property is in Denver, Seller wants Boston holidays included). Seller may also want to include "extraordinary event" exclusions to protect against force majeure situations.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept inclusion of holidays in both the Property's state and Seller's home state, but only if those holidays are "recognized" holidays (not discretionary closures).
2. Accept an "extraordinary events" exclusion, but only if it is narrowly drafted to cover government-mandated closures (not mere weather events or voluntary closures) and only if it is symmetrical (applies to both parties).
3. If Seller insists on a broader definition (more excluded days), negotiate longer numerical deadlines to compensate.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — An overly broad Business Day definition can compress critical time periods (especially title review and estoppel delivery). The risk is procedural rather than substantive, but missed deadlines can result in deemed approvals or waivers.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Additional state holidays (e.g., Election Day) may apply.
- **Multi-state portfolios:** When acquiring properties across multiple states, the Business Day definition should reference the state where each property is located, or use a uniform standard (federal holidays plus weekends).

---

## Knowledge Definition

### Preferred Position

The Knowledge definition is one of the most heavily negotiated definitions in any PSA. From the buyer's perspective, the definition should be as broad as possible — capturing not only the actual knowledge of Seller's designated individuals but also constructive knowledge (what they should know given their responsibilities) and imposing a duty of inquiry.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Seller's Knowledge" or "Knowledge of Seller" means the actual knowledge of [NAME(S)], after reasonable investigation and inquiry consistent with such person's duties and responsibilities with respect to the Property. For purposes of this definition, each such individual shall be deemed to have knowledge of all facts and circumstances that would have been disclosed by a reasonable investigation and inquiry of the files and records maintained by Seller and its property manager at the Property management office and at Seller's principal office.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Named individuals:** Insist on naming specific individuals who have day-to-day responsibility for the Property — not just a C-suite executive who may have limited familiarity with the specific asset. Push for inclusion of: (a) the asset manager, (b) the property manager, (c) the portfolio manager, and (d) any in-house counsel who has reviewed leases or environmental matters.
- **Duty of inquiry:** This is the most contested element. Buyer should push hard for at least a "reasonable inquiry" standard. At minimum, the named individuals should be deemed to know what is in the files maintained by Seller and its property manager.
- **Constructive knowledge:** Push for language providing that the named individuals are "deemed to know" information contained in the due diligence materials, the rent roll, the Leases, and the Contracts.
- **No personal liability shield:** Seller will typically include a provision stating that the named individuals are not personally liable. This is acceptable, but do not allow it to dilute the knowledge standard itself.
- **Anti-sandbagging:** Watch for provisions that deem the buyer to "know" anything contained in the due diligence materials or otherwise made available. These provisions can effectively nullify Seller's representations. If present, negotiate them down or strike them entirely.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Knowledge should be limited to "actual knowledge" of a single designated representative, without any duty of inquiry or imputed knowledge. Seller will also argue that it should not be responsible for knowledge of its property manager, leasing broker, or other agents.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept "actual knowledge without duty of inquiry" but with multiple named individuals (at least two) who have day-to-day responsibility for the Property, plus a provision that such individuals are deemed to know information in Seller's and its property manager's files.
2. Accept "actual knowledge without duty of inquiry" of named individuals, but negotiate broader representations that do not use knowledge qualifiers (e.g., representation that the rent roll is accurate, without a "to knowledge" qualifier).
3. Accept a narrow Knowledge definition but negotiate a longer survival period for representations and warranties and a lower threshold for indemnification claims.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — The Knowledge definition controls the scope of virtually every representation Seller makes. A narrow definition (single individual, no duty of inquiry, actual knowledge only) can render Seller's representations meaningless. This definition directly impacts the buyer's ability to bring post-closing claims for breach of representations.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily (large portfolio):** Ensure the Knowledge definition includes the on-site property manager, as the regional asset manager may not be familiar with unit-level conditions.
- **Data Center:** Include the facilities manager and any environmental health and safety officer, given the critical nature of environmental and operational compliance.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Some practitioners interpret New York law as imposing a constructive knowledge standard on parties to real estate transactions, regardless of the contractual definition. However, this should not be relied upon — always negotiate the contractual definition.
- **All states:** The Knowledge definition interacts with anti-fraud statutes that may impose liability regardless of the contractual knowledge standard. However, the contractual definition governs the scope of contractual representations and warranties.

---

## Material / Materiality Definition

### Preferred Position

Materiality qualifiers appear throughout PSA representations and warranties, conditions precedent, and covenants. The buyer should push for a defined, objective threshold for "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" — ideally tied to a specific dollar amount or a percentage of the Purchase Price.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Material Adverse Effect" means any effect, event, development, or change that, individually or in the aggregate, (i) results in a reduction in the value of the Property of more than [1-2]% of the Purchase Price, or (ii) materially impairs Seller's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Objective threshold:** Push for a dollar-amount or percentage-based threshold. Without one, "material" is undefined and subject to dispute. A common threshold is 1-2% of the Purchase Price for representations and conditions, and a lower threshold (e.g., $25,000-$50,000) for individual claim thresholds.
- **Carve-outs:** Watch for seller-side MAE definitions that contain extensive carve-outs (general market conditions, interest rate changes, acts of war, pandemic effects, changes in law). The more carve-outs, the less protection the MAE provides. Push to limit carve-outs to truly exogenous events and to include a "disproportionate impact" exception (i.e., the carve-out does not apply if the event affects the Property disproportionately relative to comparable properties).
- **Aggregation:** Ensure the definition includes "individually or in the aggregate" to prevent Seller from arguing that multiple small adverse events are individually immaterial.
- **Prospective vs. retrospective:** Push for a definition that captures effects that "can reasonably be expected to result in" a Material Adverse Effect — not just effects that have already occurred.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Materiality should be a qualitative standard, not a quantitative one. Seller will push for broad carve-outs to ensure that general market deterioration does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept a qualitative materiality standard (no defined dollar threshold) if the PSA contains a de minimis threshold below which the buyer cannot bring claims (e.g., $25,000-$50,000 per claim), and a survival period of at least 12 months.
2. Accept broad MAE carve-outs, but ensure the "disproportionate impact" exception is included.
3. Accept Seller's MAE definition for the closing condition, but negotiate a separate, lower threshold for post-closing indemnification claims (basket/deductible structure).

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — An undefined or excessively qualified materiality standard can make it nearly impossible for the buyer to refuse to close based on a representation being "materially" inaccurate, or to bring a post-closing claim for breach. The definition interacts with the claim cap, basket, and survival period to define the buyer's total risk exposure.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Delaware (entity-level):** Delaware courts have interpreted Material Adverse Effect narrowly in M&A contexts (see *Akorn v. Fresenius*). While this caselaw technically applies to entity acquisitions rather than real estate, sophisticated sellers will cite it to justify narrow MAE definitions.

## Affiliate Definition

### Preferred Position

The Affiliate definition matters for several PSA provisions: assignment rights, OFAC/sanctions representations, non-compete or non-solicitation provisions, and the scope of indemnification. The buyer should push for a definition that is broad enough to capture all entities under common control with the counterparty.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Affiliate" means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person. For purposes of this definition, "control" means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the definition is symmetrical (applies equally to Buyer and Seller Affiliates) unless asymmetry is justified by the transaction structure.
- For Buyer: The Affiliate definition is critical for the assignment provision. Buyer should ensure the definition is broad enough to capture its fund entities, co-investment vehicles, and any special purpose entity (SPE) to which it will assign the PSA before Closing.
- For Seller: The Affiliate definition defines the scope of Seller's OFAC/sanctions representation and the scope of the non-recourse/exculpation provision.
- Consider adding a specific carve-out for portfolio companies of a private equity sponsor that are not involved in the transaction.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The Affiliate definition should be narrow to limit the scope of its representations (particularly OFAC) and to avoid creating obligations for unrelated portfolio companies.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept a narrower Affiliate definition for purposes of OFAC/sanctions representations (e.g., limited to direct and indirect equity holders), but retain the broader definition for assignment and indemnification purposes.
2. Accept Seller's proposed definition but ensure the assignment provision separately lists the permitted assignees by category (Affiliates, fund entities, co-investment vehicles, TIC structures).

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — The Affiliate definition is a supporting definition that affects multiple provisions. Getting it wrong can restrict assignment flexibility or create gaps in Seller's representations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- No material jurisdictional variation for the Affiliate definition itself. However, the definition interacts with state-specific assignment and transfer tax provisions.

---

## Permitted Exceptions

### Preferred Position

The Permitted Exceptions definition is one of the most consequential definitions in the PSA because it determines what encumbrances the buyer must accept at Closing. The buyer's goal is a narrow, carefully controlled definition with a robust title objection and cure process.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Permitted Exceptions" means: (a) the lien of real property taxes and assessments not yet due and payable, subject to proration as provided herein; (b) the rights of Tenants under the Leases, as tenants only, without any right of purchase or first refusal; (c) those matters shown on the Title Commitment and approved or deemed approved by Buyer in accordance with Section [__]; and (d) those matters shown on the Survey and approved or deemed approved by Buyer in accordance with Section [__]. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Permitted Exceptions" shall not include (i) any mortgage, deed of trust, or other monetary lien encumbering the Property (other than real property taxes not yet due and payable), (ii) any mechanics' or materialmen's liens, (iii) any judgment liens against Seller, or (iv) any other liens or encumbrances created by Seller after the Effective Date without Buyer's prior written consent.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Mandatory cure items:** Insist that certain categories of exceptions are never "Permitted Exceptions" regardless of the title review process. At minimum, this should include: (a) all monetary liens (mortgages, deeds of trust, judgment liens, mechanics' liens, tax liens), (b) liens or encumbrances placed by Seller after the Effective Date, and (c) any exceptions that Seller voluntarily created.
- **Deemed approval mechanisms:** Watch for provisions that deem title exceptions "approved" if the buyer fails to object within a tight timeframe. Push for adequate review periods (at least 10-15 Business Days after receipt of the title commitment and underlying documents).
- **New exceptions:** Insist on the right to object to new exceptions that appear after the initial title review period, including gap exceptions between the commitment date and Closing.
- **Survey exceptions:** Ensure the definition captures survey-disclosed matters and that the buyer has a right to object to survey matters.
- **Blanket approvals:** Resist seller-side forms that include blanket Permitted Exception categories such as "all matters of record," "such state of facts as a physical inspection would disclose," or "standard printed exceptions in title policies." These can swallow the entire title review process.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The Permitted Exceptions definition should be broad to provide closing certainty, and Seller should not be obligated to cure title defects that existed when the buyer entered into the PSA and had the opportunity to discover during diligence.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept broader Permitted Exception categories only if the buyer retains the right to terminate (with return of deposit) if any title objection is not cured by Seller.
2. Accept that Seller's cure obligation for non-monetary exceptions is limited to "commercially reasonable efforts" (rather than an absolute obligation), but retain the right to terminate if the cure is unsuccessful.
3. Accept a monetary cap on Seller's obligation to cure non-monetary title defects (e.g., $250,000), but ensure that monetary liens have no cap and must be cleared at Closing in all events.
4. Accept a compressed timeline for initial title review if the buyer retains an open-ended right to object to new exceptions.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — The Permitted Exceptions definition directly determines the quality of title the buyer receives. Overbroad Permitted Exceptions can saddle the buyer with encumbrances that impair the use, value, or financability of the Property. Title insurance may not cover exceptions that were "permitted" under the PSA.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** Reciprocal easement agreements (REAs) are common and can significantly restrict the buyer's ability to redevelop or re-tenant. Ensure REAs are reviewed during diligence and not blanketly permitted.
- **Industrial:** Environmental deed restrictions and institutional controls may encumber the Property. These should be specifically addressed, not blanketly permitted.
- **Office (urban):** Shared access agreements, party wall agreements, and air rights restrictions are common. Review each individually.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Section 5-1311 of the General Obligations Law governs risk of loss. Parties typically waive this provision, but its default rules should be understood.
- **Title insurance practices vary by state.** In some states (NY, NJ, CT), the buyer's attorney conducts the title search; in others (CA, WA, CO), a title company handles it. The timeline for title review should reflect local practice.

## Effective Date Mechanics

### Preferred Position

The Effective Date should be objectively determinable and should trigger all subsequent deadlines in the PSA. The buyer should push for an Effective Date defined as the last date of execution by both parties, established by the dates shown below the signatures.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Effective Date" means the date this Agreement is executed and delivered by the last of Buyer and Seller, as established by the dates shown below each of the signatures of Seller and Buyer on the signature page(s) hereof.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Objective determination:** Avoid subjective Effective Date triggers (e.g., "the date the parties agree to be bound"). Use signature dates or delivery dates.
- **Gap between signing and effectiveness:** Some PSAs use a "reference date" (the date at the top of the agreement) and a separate "Effective Date" (the date of last signature). Ensure all deadlines run from the Effective Date, not the reference date.
- **Escrow deposit timing:** The Effective Date triggers the deposit deadline. Ensure the buyer has adequate time (at least 2-3 Business Days) between the Effective Date and the deposit deadline.
- **Due diligence period:** Confirm that the due diligence period commences on the Effective Date, not on some other triggering event.
- **Counter-signatures:** If the PSA will be executed in counterparts, clarify how and when the Effective Date is determined. The buyer should push for delivery of a fully executed counterpart to both parties as a condition to effectiveness.
- **"Not an offer" clause:** Include a provision stating that circulation of a draft PSA does not constitute an offer and the PSA is only binding upon mutual execution. This protects the buyer from claims of binding obligation before it has completed internal approvals.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The Effective Date should be fixed as a specific date agreed upon by the parties (often the date of the last signature) and all deadlines should be determined from that fixed date. Seller may resist mechanisms that allow the buyer to delay the Effective Date.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept a fixed reference date at the top of the agreement if all substantive deadlines (diligence, title review, closing) are defined as specific calendar dates rather than running from the Effective Date.
2. Accept an Effective Date tied to the date the fully executed agreement is delivered to escrow, if the agreement provides for escrow delivery within a short timeframe after last signature.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — Ambiguity in the Effective Date can lead to disputes over whether deadlines have been missed and whether the deposit was timely delivered. The risk is procedural but can have substantive consequences (e.g., loss of diligence period, deemed approval of title exceptions).

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Statute of Frauds (all states):** The PSA must satisfy the applicable state's statute of frauds. Ensure the Effective Date mechanism does not create an argument that the agreement was not "executed" by both parties. Electronic signatures are generally enforceable under UETA and the federal ESIGN Act, but practices vary.

## Parties Identification and SPE Requirements

### Preferred Position

The buyer should verify the Seller's identity against the vesting deed and title commitment, and should ensure the PSA structure allows for assignment to a special purpose entity (SPE) before Closing. The buyer should also require representations regarding Seller's authority, good standing, and entity structure.

**Key structural requirements:**

1. **Seller identification:** Seller's name must exactly match the owner of record per the title commitment and vesting deed. Any discrepancy can create a title defect.
2. **Seller entity type and jurisdiction:** The PSA should identify Seller's entity type and state of organization. Confirm Seller is in good standing in its state of organization and qualified to do business in the state where the Property is located.
3. **Buyer assignment to SPE:** The buyer should negotiate for the right to assign the PSA to a single purpose entity (SPE) created for this acquisition, without Seller's consent. This is standard in institutional transactions and is typically required by the buyer's lender.

**Preferred sample language for assignment:**

> Buyer may, without Seller's consent, assign this Agreement to (a) one or more Affiliates of Buyer, (b) a single purpose entity formed by Buyer for the purpose of acquiring the Property, or (c) one or more Affiliates of Buyer and/or third parties under a tenancy in common structure, provided that an Affiliate of Buyer will serve as the property manager of the Property. No assignment by Buyer shall release Buyer from any liability hereunder.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Seller verification:** Confirm that the Seller entity named in the PSA is the actual owner of the Property. If the Property is owned by multiple entities (e.g., separate entities for land and improvements, or a condominium structure), all owners must be parties to the PSA.
- **Authority representations:** Require Seller to represent that it has all necessary authority to enter into the PSA and consummate the transaction, and that no consents from partners, members, lenders, or other third parties are required (or if required, that they will be obtained).
- **SPE assignment right:** This is non-negotiable for institutional buyers. The right to assign to an SPE must be expressly stated. The typical compromise is that assignment requires notice but not consent, and the assignor remains liable.
- **Multiple Sellers:** If the Seller is more than one entity (e.g., tenants in common, or separate entities owning different parcels), address whether their obligations are joint and several or several only. Buyer should push for joint and several liability.
- **Guarantor:** If Seller is a thinly capitalized SPE (which is common), consider requiring a creditworthy guarantor for Seller's post-closing obligations (representations, indemnities).

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Assignment should require Seller's consent (which Seller may withhold in its sole discretion). Seller may also resist joint and several liability if there are multiple selling entities.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept that assignment requires Seller's consent, but with an express exception for assignment to Affiliates and SPEs (the "permitted transfer" exception). Seller's consent should be required only for assignments to unaffiliated third parties.
2. Accept several (not joint and several) liability among multiple Sellers, but only if each Seller's obligations and liabilities are clearly allocated and each Seller's share of the Purchase Price is specified.
3. Accept that Buyer remains liable notwithstanding any assignment, and that notice of assignment must be provided at least 2-5 Business Days before Closing.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Incorrect party identification can create title defects and recording problems. Inability to assign to an SPE can disrupt the buyer's financing structure and entity planning. Thinly capitalized Sellers without guarantors can render post-closing indemnification rights worthless.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** SPE assignment is standard across all institutional commercial real estate acquisitions. The buyer's lender will virtually always require the borrower to be a single purpose, bankruptcy-remote entity.
- **Portfolio transactions:** When acquiring multiple properties, the buyer may need to assign different properties to different SPEs. Ensure the PSA allows partial assignments.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Transfer taxes:** Some jurisdictions (NY, CT, DC, PA) impose transfer taxes on assignments of PSAs or interests in entities holding real property. Ensure the assignment mechanism does not trigger additional transfer tax liability.
- **New York (RPT Law Section 1402-a):** Transfers of controlling interests in entities that own real property may trigger transfer tax. Structure SPE assignments to avoid this.
- **Delaware:** Most institutional SPEs are formed in Delaware for favorable entity law. Ensure the PSA permits Delaware LLCs as assignees and that the assignment provision does not require the assignee to be organized in the state where the Property is located.

## Excluded Items / Seller Reserved Rights

### Preferred Position

The buyer should narrowly constrain Seller's ability to exclude items from the Property or reserve rights post-Closing. Any exclusions must be specifically scheduled and finalized before the end of the due diligence period.

**Preferred approach:**

> Any items excluded from the definition of "Property" or reserved by Seller shall be specifically identified on Schedule [__] attached hereto. Seller shall have no right to amend Schedule [__] after the expiration of the Due Diligence Period without Buyer's prior written consent. Seller shall remove all Excluded Items from the Property at Seller's sole cost and expense on or before the Closing Date.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Specificity requirement:** Do not accept vague exclusions (e.g., "Seller's proprietary materials," "items used across Seller's portfolio"). Every exclusion must be specifically identified.
- **Finality:** The exclusion schedule must be locked before the due diligence period expires. Any attempt to add items after diligence should require Buyer's consent.
- **Removal obligation:** If Seller is excluding items, Seller must remove them at its own expense. The buyer should not inherit responsibility for items that are neither part of the Property nor removed.
- **Non-exclusive reserved rights:** Watch for provisions where Seller reserves "non-exclusive" rights to assert claims or pursue litigation related to the Property. These can create interference with the buyer's management of the Property. Any reserved rights should be narrowly tailored and time-limited.
- **Warranty and claim reservations:** The seller-side Seller Income Property form contains a provision reserving to Seller, on a "non-exclusive basis with Buyer," the right to assert claims against third parties under warranties and guaranties related to design, construction, or performance. This is seller-favorable and should be resisted. The buyer should own all such claims exclusively after Closing.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** It needs to retain certain items (marketing materials, proprietary analyses, attorney-client privileged documents, appraisals) and to reserve the right to pursue pre-Closing claims.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept exclusion of privileged materials, appraisals, and internal analyses (these are not operational assets), but require Seller to deliver all operational documents and materials.
2. Accept a non-exclusive reservation of claims related to pre-Closing periods, but only for claims that do not interfere with Buyer's use or operation of the Property, and only for a limited time period (e.g., 12-24 months post-Closing).
3. Accept exclusion of Seller's management office personal property if Seller's manager will be replaced at Closing.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — Overbroad exclusions can deprive the buyer of operationally necessary assets. Reserved rights can create post-Closing conflicts. The risk increases in transactions where Seller is an active operating platform (not a passive investor).
