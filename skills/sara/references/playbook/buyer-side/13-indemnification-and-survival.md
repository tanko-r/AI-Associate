# Section 13: Indemnification, Survival, and Liability Limitations -- Buyer's Playbook

This section governs the post-closing economic allocation of risk between buyer and seller. In institutional commercial real estate acquisitions ($50M+), this is one of the most heavily negotiated areas because it determines the buyer's actual remedy if seller's representations prove false after closing. The interplay between survival periods, liability caps, baskets, anti-sandbagging provisions, and the as-is clause creates a complex matrix that defines the buyer's real-world recourse.

---

## Survival Periods for Representations and Warranties

### Preferred Position

Push for the longest survival periods the market will bear, with tiered durations based on the nature of the representation:

- **General representations and warranties**: 18 to 24 months from Closing. This provides sufficient time for a full annual cycle of property operations, tenant reconciliations, and the emergence of latent issues that only surface through operating experience.
- **Fundamental/organizational representations** (authority, due organization, power to convey, no bankruptcy, OFAC/AML compliance): Indefinite survival or coextensive with the applicable statute of limitations. These go to the validity of the transaction itself and should never expire.
- **Tax representations** (FIRPTA, transfer tax): Survival through the later of (a) the applicable statute of limitations (including extensions), or (b) 36 months.
- **Environmental representations**: 36 months minimum, with a strong push for survival coextensive with the applicable statute of limitations under CERCLA (which has none for government claims) or state equivalents. Environmental contamination is often latent and discoverable only after extended ownership and operational experience.
- **Title and conveyance representations**: Indefinite survival -- these are warranted by the deed itself in many jurisdictions and should not be subject to contractual shortening.
- **Lease and tenant representations**: 18 months minimum to capture a full operating cycle, including annual reconciliation statements (see UNICO Buyer Side, Section 7.7, requiring Seller to remain responsible for prior-year reconciliation statements).
- **Brokerage representations**: Indefinite survival, or at minimum coextensive with any applicable statute of limitations for broker commission claims.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The UNICO Seller Side form provides only 6 months of survival (Section 5.4), while the UNICO Buyer Side form provides 12 months (Section 5.4). The Meadows form (seller-skewed) provides only a blank number of months (Section 5.1). The Seller Income Property form provides 6 months (Section 7.3). The Detailed Seller PSA provides only 6 months with a 1% cap (Section 10.4). These reflect the seller-favorable end of the market.
- Frame the argument for longer periods around operational reality: annual tenant reconciliation cycles require 12+ months to complete, tax reassessments may take 18+ months to emerge, and environmental conditions may be latent for years.
- Insist that the survival period is tolled during the pendency of any claim properly noticed within the survival period. This prevents sellers from running out the clock through dilatory litigation tactics.
- Ensure the survival clause expressly states that any claim "commenced" (i.e., written notice delivered) within the survival period survives until final resolution, even if resolution occurs after the survival period expires. The UNICO Seller Side form includes language that claims "not then in litigation" terminate -- use this as a model but broaden "in litigation" to include "subject to a written claim notice."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: 6 months, flat, all representations, no exceptions. This is the most common seller starting position in institutional deals and is reflected in the UNICO Seller Side and Detailed Seller PSA forms.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If seller resists 18-24 months on general reps, accept 12 months but insist on carve-outs for environmental (36 months), fundamental reps (indefinite), and tax reps (statute of limitations).
2. If seller insists on 6 months flat, counter with 9 months plus a tolling provision that pauses the survival clock during pendency of insurance claims (see Insurance-First Requirements below) and during any period seller fails to respond to a claim notice.
3. If seller will not move beyond 6 months, insist that the commencement of a claim (delivery of notice) within the survival period preserves the claim indefinitely until resolved.
4. As a last resort, accept 6 months but require a post-closing escrow/holdback (see Escrow/Holdback section below) that remains in place for 12 months regardless of the rep survival period, creating de facto extended protection.

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk if survival is less than 12 months**: Annual tenant reconciliations, tax reassessments, and insurance audits typically complete 6-12 months post-closing. A 6-month survival period may expire before the buyer has the information needed to identify a breach.
- **Critical risk for environmental**: Contamination claims can emerge years after closing. Any survival period shorter than the applicable statute of limitations leaves the buyer exposed to the full cost of remediation without recourse against the seller.
- **Moderate risk for organizational/fundamental reps**: While these are less likely to be breached, a breach (e.g., seller lacked authority) goes to the validity of the entire transaction.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Industrial/logistics**: Push harder for extended environmental survival (36+ months). Former manufacturing use, loading dock areas, underground storage tanks, and heavy vehicle operations create elevated contamination risk.
- **Data centers**: Environmental survival is critical given cooling system chemicals, diesel fuel storage for generators, and battery waste. Also push for extended survival on utility and infrastructure representations.
- **Multifamily**: Shorter general survival (12 months) may be acceptable given the granularity of tenant-level diligence, but push for extended survival on building code and habitability representations, particularly in rent-regulated jurisdictions.
- **Retail**: Extend survival for tenant representations to 18+ months to capture percentage rent reconciliations and co-tenancy clause triggers that may not manifest until the next full fiscal year.
- **Office**: Standard 12-18 month general survival is appropriate. Focus on extended survival for representations regarding building systems, capital expenditure obligations, and pending lease negotiations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York**: The NY Negotiation Checklist (Practical Law) recommends survival of 1 month to 1 year depending on the representation, with certain reps surviving indefinitely. New York's 6-year statute of limitations for breach of contract (CPLR 213(2)) provides a long tail if the agreement does not contractually shorten it. Sellers will insist on contractual shortening.
- **California**: California Civil Code Section 1542 waivers are frequently included in seller releases (see Meadows form, Section 4.6). Ensure survival provisions are drafted to override any general release language.
- **Illinois**: The IL Pro-Buyer Long Form includes robust survival provisions. Illinois courts generally enforce contractual survival periods that shorten the statute of limitations, so the PSA language controls.
- **Oregon**: The Meadows form is governed by Oregon law. Oregon's 6-year contract statute of limitations (ORS 12.080) can be contractually shortened but not below 1 year under ORS 12.070.
- **Delaware entity considerations**: Where seller is a Delaware LLC (common in institutional deals -- see UNICO forms, Meadows), the risk of post-closing dissolution is elevated. Tie survival provisions to anti-dissolution covenants (see Seller Entity Dissolution Risk below).
- **Massachusetts/Colorado**: The Detailed Seller PSA is governed by Massachusetts law with Colorado venue. Massachusetts enforces contractual survival limitations. Ensure the PSA expressly addresses choice of law for survival provisions.

## Survival of Covenants and Indemnification Obligations

### Preferred Position

Ensure that the following categories of covenants expressly survive Closing without time limitation (or with extended periods):

- **Post-closing adjustment obligations**: Proration true-ups, tenant reconciliation adjustments, delinquent rent collection obligations. The UNICO forms (both Buyer and Seller Side, Section 7.7) expressly provide that annual reconciliation obligations survive Closing. Push for survival of at least 18 months for proration true-ups to capture a full tax year cycle.
- **Indemnification obligations**: All indemnification obligations (for reps, covenants, and third-party claims) should survive for the longer of (a) the survival period of the underlying rep or covenant, or (b) 24 months.
- **Confidentiality obligations**: The UNICO Seller Side form provides 12 months post-termination survival for confidentiality (Section 14.4). If the deal closes, confidentiality should terminate; if the deal terminates, confidentiality should survive for 12-24 months.
- **Access and inspection indemnities**: Buyer's indemnification of seller for pre-closing site inspections (see Meadows, Section 1.2) should survive termination of the agreement indefinitely -- these relate to actual physical damage or injury.
- **Brokerage indemnities**: Indefinite survival, as broker claims can surface years later.
- **Tax indemnities**: Survival coextensive with the applicable statute of limitations, including extensions.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The anti-merger clause is critical: the UNICO forms (Section 16.18) provide that covenants, agreements, representations, and warranties survive Closing and do not merge into the deed. Ensure this language is in every PSA and that it is not undermined by a separate merger clause in the deed or assignment documents.
- Distinguish between "termination survival" (obligations that survive if the deal does not close) and "closing survival" (obligations that survive after closing). Different obligations belong in each category.
- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 10.4) makes the post-closing breach-of-reps remedy the "sole and exclusive remedy" -- ensure that indemnification obligations are carved out from this exclusivity or are themselves characterized as the exclusive remedy mechanism.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Only enumerated obligations survive; everything else merges at Closing.

**Fallback**: Accept enumerated survival but ensure the enumeration is comprehensive. At minimum, the following must be listed: proration true-ups, tenant reconciliations, brokerage indemnities, tax indemnities, confidentiality, access indemnities, and all representation and warranty survival as separately negotiated.

### Risk Assessment

Failure to include a comprehensive anti-merger clause or to enumerate surviving obligations is a structural deficiency. The common-law merger doctrine will extinguish most contractual obligations upon delivery and acceptance of the deed. The UNICO forms address this (Section 16.18), but many seller forms do not.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types**: Post-closing proration adjustments are universal. Ensure the true-up period (typically 90-180 days post-closing) is long enough for the specific asset type's reconciliation complexity.
- **Multifamily**: Utility reconciliation survival is critical where master-metered or where RUBS (ratio utility billing) systems are in place.
- **Retail**: Percentage rent reconciliation survival should extend to 18 months to capture a full fiscal year of tenant sales reporting.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- The merger doctrine is a common-law rule in virtually all US jurisdictions. It must be contractually overridden in every deal. New York courts apply the merger doctrine strictly absent express survival language. See the NY Negotiation Checklist's emphasis on ensuring survival in the purchase agreement and preservation in closing documents.
- California courts recognize contractual anti-merger clauses but may construe ambiguous language against survival. Be explicit.

## Cap on Seller's Aggregate Liability

### Preferred Position

Negotiate for the highest possible cap, expressed as a percentage of the Purchase Price:

- **Preferred**: 5% to 10% of Purchase Price with no cap on fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or willful misconduct.
- **Acceptable**: 3% to 5% of Purchase Price.
- **Minimum acceptable**: 2.5% of Purchase Price (the UNICO Buyer Side form provides the greater of $1,000,000 or 5% of Purchase Price in Section 5.4 -- this is buyer-favorable and should be the model).
- **Resist**: 1% of Purchase Price (the Detailed Seller PSA, Section 10.4) or flat dollar amounts unrelated to the Purchase Price.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The UNICO Seller Side form caps liability at 2.5% of Purchase Price (Section 5.4). The UNICO Buyer Side form provides the greater of $1,000,000 or 5% of Purchase Price (Section 5.4). The Detailed Seller PSA provides 1% of Purchase Price (Section 10.4). The Seller Income Property form uses a blank dollar amount (Section 7.1). These create a clear negotiation range.
- On a $100M deal, the difference between 1% ($1M) and 5% ($5M) is enormous. Frame the argument in terms of the buyer's actual exposure: a single misrepresented environmental condition or tenant lease issue can easily exceed 1% of the Purchase Price.
- Insist that the cap applies only to breach-of-rep claims. The following should be outside the cap entirely:
  - Fraud, intentional misrepresentation, and willful misconduct.
  - Indemnification obligations arising from third-party claims (e.g., broker claims, tax claims).
  - Post-closing proration adjustments and tenant reconciliations.
  - Breach of covenants that expressly survive closing (e.g., cooperation obligations, further assurances).
- Push for the cap to be a "ceiling" on recovery, not a "fund" -- i.e., it does not create an escrow or holdback but rather limits the maximum aggregate amount recoverable.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: 1% to 1.5% of Purchase Price, inclusive of all claims.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If seller insists on 1.5%, accept but carve out fraud/intentional misrepresentation (uncapped), environmental claims (separate cap at 3%), and post-closing prorations (outside the cap entirely).
2. If seller resists carve-outs, negotiate a "two-tier" cap: 1.5% for general reps, and a separate 3% "super-cap" for fundamental reps, environmental reps, and fraud claims.
3. If seller insists on a flat 1%, offset by requiring a larger escrow/holdback (see below) or a guaranty from seller's parent or manager.
4. As a nuclear option, if the cap is unacceptably low, seek a purchase price reduction reflecting the buyer's uninsured risk.

### Risk Assessment

- A 1% cap on a $100M deal provides only $1M of protection. A single lease dispute, environmental remediation, or tax reassessment can easily exceed this amount.
- The gap between the cap and the buyer's actual exposure creates "naked risk" that is not covered by the seller, insurance, or any other source.
- In portfolio or platform deals, consider negotiating per-property sub-caps and a portfolio-level aggregate cap.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Industrial**: Higher cap justified given environmental risk. Push for 5% minimum.
- **Data centers**: Higher cap justified given infrastructure complexity and utility exposure. Push for 5% with separate environmental and utility sub-caps.
- **Office/Retail**: 3-5% is market for institutional deals.
- **Multifamily**: 2.5-5% is market. Lower caps may be acceptable for newer construction with fewer latent defect risks.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Courts in virtually all US jurisdictions enforce contractual liability caps, including caps below what would otherwise be recoverable. There is generally no public-policy floor for contractual limitations on commercial liability between sophisticated parties.
- New York and California courts have enforced caps as low as 1% of purchase price in commercial real estate deals.
- Fraud carve-outs are enforceable everywhere and should never be omitted.

## Basket/Deductible Thresholds

### Preferred Position

- **Tipping basket (preferred)**: Once the aggregate amount of claims exceeds the basket threshold, the seller is liable for the full amount of all claims from dollar one (i.e., the basket "tips" and becomes first-dollar coverage).
- **Basket threshold**: 0.25% to 0.50% of Purchase Price. On a $100M deal, this is $250,000 to $500,000.
- **Resist true deductibles**: In a true deductible structure, the seller is only liable for amounts exceeding the threshold, meaning the buyer permanently absorbs the first $250,000-$500,000 of losses. This significantly reduces the buyer's effective recovery.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The UNICO Seller Side form uses a per-claim minimum of $50,000 (Section 5.4) rather than an aggregate basket. The UNICO Buyer Side form uses a per-claim minimum of $25,000 (Section 5.4). The Detailed Seller PSA uses $100,000 as a tipping basket -- once claims exceed $100,000, the full amount is recoverable up to the cap (Section 10.4).
- The basket and the cap work together: a $100,000 basket with a $1,000,000 cap means the buyer's actual recovery range is between $100,001 and $1,000,000. Negotiate both simultaneously.
- Insist that the basket applies only to breach-of-rep claims, not to indemnification for third-party claims, proration adjustments, or fraud.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: True deductible at 0.50% to 1.00% of Purchase Price.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If seller insists on a true deductible, accept but reduce the threshold to 0.15% to 0.25% of Purchase Price.
2. If seller insists on a higher threshold, convert to a tipping basket at the seller's proposed threshold (this costs the seller nothing in the vast majority of scenarios but provides the buyer with first-dollar recovery in the event of a significant breach).
3. Accept a true deductible at 0.35% but add a "mini-basket" provision: individual claims under $10,000-$25,000 do not count toward the aggregate threshold (a de minimis filter), but claims above that threshold count from the first dollar once the aggregate basket is met.
4. If the basket is high, push for a lower cap or a larger escrow to compensate.

### Risk Assessment

- The difference between a tipping basket and a true deductible is the buyer's permanent absorption of losses up to the threshold amount. On a $100M deal with a 0.50% true deductible, the buyer permanently absorbs the first $500,000 -- this is a meaningful economic concession.
- A tipping basket provides the same screening function (filtering nuisance claims) without permanently shifting loss to the buyer.

### Asset-Type Variations

- Generally consistent across asset types. Adjust the threshold percentage based on the deal's risk profile.
- For older assets or those with known conditions, a lower basket is justified because the probability of claims exceeding any threshold is higher.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Both tipping baskets and true deductibles are enforceable in all US jurisdictions as a matter of freedom of contract between sophisticated commercial parties.
- The structure must be clearly drafted -- ambiguous language has been litigated in multiple jurisdictions. Use explicit "from the first dollar" (tipping) or "only to the extent exceeding" (deductible) language.

---

## Per-Claim Minimums (De Minimis Threshold)

### Preferred Position

- Per-claim minimum of $10,000 to $25,000. Claims below this threshold are excluded entirely and do not count toward the aggregate basket.
- Purpose: Filters trivial claims and reduces administrative burden on both parties without meaningfully reducing buyer protection.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The UNICO Seller Side form sets the per-claim minimum at $50,000 (Section 5.4). The UNICO Buyer Side form sets it at $25,000 (Section 5.4). The Detailed Seller PSA sets it at $100,000 (Section 10.4).
- $50,000 per-claim minimums on $50M-$100M deals are aggressive seller positions. On a $75M deal, a $50,000 per-claim minimum means a tenant dispute, lease misrepresentation, or building code violation under $50,000 is entirely non-recoverable.
- Ensure the de minimis threshold is clearly independent of the aggregate basket -- claims below the de minimis do not count toward the basket.
- Distinguish between per-claim minimums and claim aggregation: if the same underlying facts give rise to multiple claims (e.g., a single misrepresented lease generates claims for lost rent, tenant improvement costs, and leasing commissions), these should be treated as a single claim for de minimis purposes.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: $50,000 to $100,000 per-claim minimum.

**Fallback**: Accept $50,000 per-claim minimum but insist on (a) aggregation of related claims for de minimis purposes, (b) a tipping basket (not true deductible) at the aggregate level, and (c) exclusion of fraud and environmental claims from the de minimis threshold.

### Risk Assessment

- Per-claim minimums primarily affect small operational issues (minor lease discrepancies, minor code violations, small tenant disputes). At the $25,000 level, the filtering effect is appropriate for institutional deals.
- At $100,000 (as in the Detailed Seller PSA), the threshold begins to exclude meaningful claims, particularly for smaller properties in a portfolio.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily**: Lower de minimis thresholds ($10,000-$15,000) are appropriate given the high volume of individual tenant-level issues, each of which may be small but cumulatively significant.
- **Office/Industrial/Retail**: $25,000 is appropriate for institutional single-asset deals.
- **Portfolio deals**: Consider a per-property de minimis as well as an aggregate de minimis.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Universally enforceable. No jurisdiction-specific considerations.

---

## Insurance-First Requirements and Buyer's Fallback

### Preferred Position

Resist any obligation to exhaust insurance remedies before asserting claims against seller. Insurance recovery is slow, uncertain, and may not cover the specific breach. The buyer should have a direct right of action against the seller.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 10.4) requires the buyer to "first seek recovery under any insurance policies, Leases and Contracts prior to seeking recovery from Seller, and Seller shall not be liable to Purchaser if Purchaser's claim is satisfied from such sources." This is a significant seller-favorable provision.
- Insurance-first requirements create multiple problems for the buyer:
  - Insurance claims are subject to deductibles, exclusions, policy limits, and coverage disputes.
  - Insurance carriers may deny coverage or delay payment for months or years.
  - Filing an insurance claim may increase future premiums.
  - The insurance policy may not cover the specific type of loss arising from a seller's breach.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Buyer must exhaust insurance remedies first.

**Fallback sequence (critical -- multi-step strategy)**:
1. **Primary fallback**: Reject insurance-first entirely. Buyer may assert claims directly against seller, and seller may seek subrogation or assignment of buyer's insurance rights after paying the claim.
2. **Secondary fallback**: Accept a "reasonable efforts" obligation to file insurance claims, but the survival period is tolled (frozen) for the duration of the insurance claims process. This prevents the seller from using the insurance-first requirement to run out the survival clock. Draft: "In the event Buyer is required to submit a claim to its insurer prior to seeking recovery from Seller, the Survival Period shall be tolled from the date Buyer submits such claim until the earlier of (a) the date the insurer issues a final determination, or (b) 180 days after submission."
3. **Tertiary fallback**: Accept insurance-first but with a time limit: if the insurer has not responded within 90 days, buyer may proceed directly against seller. The survival period is extended by the number of days between the insurance claim submission and the earlier of the insurer's response or the 90-day deadline.
4. **Final fallback**: Accept insurance-first but with an offset mechanism: seller gets credit for amounts actually recovered from insurance (net of buyer's deductible and premium increases), but buyer is not required to wait for insurance resolution before bringing a claim. Buyer assigns to seller (or grants seller subrogation rights over) any insurance recovery related to the claim, net of buyer's costs.

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk**: An insurance-first requirement combined with a short survival period (e.g., 6 months) can effectively eliminate the buyer's right to assert claims against the seller. If the insurance process takes 4-5 months, the buyer has only 1-2 months to prepare and assert a claim.
- **Mitigation**: The tolling mechanism described in Fallback 2 is the most important protective device in this area.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All types**: Insurance-first provisions are more common in industrial and office deals where the seller expects the buyer to carry comprehensive property and environmental insurance. Less common in multifamily deals.
- **Data centers**: Particularly problematic given the complexity of infrastructure insurance and the potential for coverage disputes over mechanical systems.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Insurance-first provisions are generally enforceable as a matter of contract. No jurisdiction prohibits them outright.
- In subrogation-friendly jurisdictions, the assignment/subrogation approach (Fallback 4) is cleanest because it preserves the buyer's direct claim while giving the seller the benefit of insurance recovery.

---

## Interaction with As-Is/Where-Is Clause

### Preferred Position

The as-is clause must contain an explicit, unambiguous carve-out preserving the buyer's right to assert claims for breach of seller's express representations and warranties, seller's covenants, and seller's indemnification obligations.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Every institutional PSA includes an as-is clause. The question is not whether to include one but how to draft the carve-out. The key language appears across all source forms:
  - The Meadows form (Section 4.6) includes a broad as-is and release clause with the critical carve-out: "Except to the extent set forth in the Seller's Warranties."
  - The Seller Income Property form (Section 7.4) includes: "The foregoing release shall not, however, affect Seller's liability for or under (a) any representations and warranties made specifically by Seller in Section 7.1 above to the extent same survive Closing as provided therein; or (b) any other obligations of Seller identified herein which are to be performed after Closing."
  - The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 7.1(c)) carves out "any rights or remedies that Purchaser may have against Seller as a result of a breach of any of the Seller Representations or of any covenant of Seller expressly set forth in this Agreement that expressly survives the Closing."
- Ensure the carve-out language is mirrored in:
  - The as-is clause itself.
  - The general release clause (if separate from the as-is clause).
  - The deed (see Detailed Seller PSA, Exhibit F, which includes deed language preserving rep survival).
  - The assignment of leases and assignment of contracts.
  - Any bill of sale.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Broad as-is with no carve-out, or a narrowly drafted carve-out that is ambiguous.

**Fallback**: The carve-out for express representations and surviving covenants is market-standard even in seller-favorable forms. If the seller resists, point to the Meadows form (a seller-skewed deal) and the Seller Income Property form -- both include the carve-out. There is no legitimate reason for a seller to refuse this carve-out if the seller is standing behind its own representations.

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical risk**: Without the carve-out, the as-is clause may be construed to waive all post-closing claims, including claims for fraud. While most jurisdictions hold that fraud cannot be contractually waived, ambiguous language creates costly litigation risk.
- Ensure the carve-out is drafted broadly enough to cover claims arising "under, related to, or in connection with" the express representations, not merely claims "for breach of" representations.

### Asset-Type Variations

- The as-is clause is universal across all asset types. The carve-out language should be consistent regardless of asset type.
- For environmental conditions, the as-is clause often includes a specific environmental release (see Meadows, Section 4.6: "Buyer... hereby releases Seller... from, and waives all claims and liability, including Environmental Liability"). Ensure this environmental release also contains the carve-out for seller's express environmental representations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **California**: California Civil Code Section 1542 waivers are frequently included in the release language. Ensure the Section 1542 waiver does not inadvertently waive claims preserved by the carve-out. Draft: "The foregoing waiver of California Civil Code Section 1542 shall not apply to claims arising from a breach of Seller's express representations and warranties."
- **New York**: New York courts strictly construe as-is clauses and have held that they can bar claims for negligent misrepresentation but not fraud. Express carve-out language eliminates ambiguity.
- **Oregon**: Oregon follows general principles. The Meadows form's carve-out language is well-drafted.
- **Illinois**: Illinois courts enforce as-is clauses but require clear and unambiguous language. The IL Pro-Buyer Long Form includes robust carve-outs.

---

## Indemnification Procedures: Notice Requirements

### Preferred Position

- **Notice deadline**: Written notice of a claim must be delivered within the survival period, but the deadline should be measured from the date the buyer first becomes aware of the breach (a "discovery" trigger), not from the date of Closing.
- **Form of notice**: Written notice delivered in accordance with the PSA's general notice provisions. The notice should describe the claim in reasonable detail, including the nature of the breach, the facts giving rise to the claim, and a good-faith estimate of damages.
- **Cure period**: Seller should have 30 days from receipt of notice to cure the breach before the buyer may pursue remedies. However, if the breach is incapable of cure (e.g., a false representation), the buyer should have immediate recourse.
- **Preservation of claim**: Delivery of a conforming notice within the survival period preserves the claim until final resolution, regardless of whether resolution occurs within or after the survival period.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The Meadows form (Section 1.2, indemnity for site access) includes detailed procedures: if Seller notifies Buyer of a claim and Buyer fails to respond within a specified number of business days, Seller may defend and settle the claim. Push for a reciprocal right.
- Ensure that the notice requirement is a covenant (an obligation), not a condition precedent (a prerequisite to recovery). If notice is a condition precedent, failure to deliver timely notice extinguishes the claim entirely, even if the failure was harmless. If notice is a covenant, late notice may reduce recovery but does not extinguish the claim.
- Include a provision that defective notice does not invalidate a claim if the seller was not materially prejudiced by the defect.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Notice is a condition precedent; late or defective notice extinguishes the claim.

**Fallback**: Accept notice as a condition precedent but add: "provided, however, that the failure to deliver timely notice shall not bar a claim to the extent that Seller was not materially prejudiced by such failure."

### Risk Assessment

- Notice provisions are procedural but can be dispositive. A buyer that discovers a breach on month 11 of a 12-month survival period needs sufficient time to investigate and deliver a conforming notice.
- Build in internal compliance procedures to docket survival expiration dates and conduct pre-expiration reviews of all representations.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No material variation by asset type. Procedures are universal.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- New York courts have strictly enforced notice-as-condition-precedent provisions, barring claims where notice was even one day late. The prejudice-based exception is therefore critical.
- California and Illinois courts are more flexible and may excuse late notice if the seller was not prejudiced, even without contractual language to that effect. However, contractual language is always preferable.

---

## Indemnification Procedures: Defense Rights and Cooperation

### Preferred Position

- **Buyer controls defense of indemnified claims**: The indemnified party (buyer) should have the right to control the defense of any claim, including the right to select counsel, direct litigation strategy, and approve settlements.
- **Seller cooperation**: Seller must reasonably cooperate with the buyer's defense at seller's own expense, including providing documents, making personnel available for interviews and testimony, and executing necessary authorizations.
- **Settlement approval**: Neither party may settle a claim for which the other party is liable without the other party's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

### Key Negotiation Points

- The Meadows form (Section 1.2) addresses defense rights in the context of buyer's site-access indemnity: if buyer fails to defend, seller may defend and settle "subject to the indemnification provided for herein." Push for reciprocal provisions.
- Distinguish between first-party claims (buyer claims directly against seller for breach) and third-party claims (claims by third parties against buyer that trigger seller's indemnification obligation). Defense rights are primarily relevant to third-party claims.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Seller controls the defense of third-party claims for which it is the indemnitor.

**Fallback**: Accept seller's control of defense of third-party claims but with the following protections: (a) buyer has the right to participate at its own expense with counsel of its choice, (b) seller may not settle any claim that imposes non-monetary obligations on buyer or that does not include a full release of buyer without buyer's consent, and (c) if seller fails to assume the defense within 30 days of notice, buyer may assume the defense at seller's expense.

### Risk Assessment

- Defense control is a significant right. The party controlling the defense makes strategic decisions that affect the outcome. Ensure that whichever party controls the defense has adequate economic incentive to minimize liability.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No material variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Defense rights provisions are universally enforceable as a matter of contract.

---

## Third-Party Claim Procedures

### Preferred Position

- Upon receiving notice of a third-party claim that may give rise to an indemnification obligation, buyer must promptly notify seller in writing.
- Seller has 30 days to elect to assume the defense. If seller does not assume, buyer defends at seller's expense.
- Seller's obligation to indemnify is not diminished by buyer's failure to give prompt notice unless seller demonstrates material prejudice.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Third-party claim procedures are distinct from first-party (direct breach) claim procedures. First-party claims require only a notice and a demand; third-party claims involve ongoing litigation management.
- Include a "cooperation" obligation: each party must cooperate with the other in the defense of third-party claims, including joint privilege preservation and document sharing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Standard provisions. Sellers generally accept standard third-party claim procedures. The main points of negotiation are defense control (see above) and settlement authority.

### Risk Assessment

- The primary risk is a gap between the third-party claim timeline and the survival period. Third-party claims often take years to resolve. Ensure the survival period for indemnification obligations is not shorter than the likely resolution timeline.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail**: Third-party claims from customers (slip-and-fall, ADA) are more common. Ensure pre-closing incidents are covered by seller's indemnity.
- **Industrial**: Third-party environmental claims (e.g., from neighboring property owners or government agencies) are more common and may take years to surface.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Standard across all jurisdictions. Ensure compliance with any jurisdiction-specific procedural requirements for asserting indemnification claims.

---

## Exclusive Remedy Provisions

### Preferred Position

Resist exclusive remedy clauses that limit the buyer to indemnification as the sole post-closing remedy. The buyer should preserve all remedies available at law and in equity, subject to the negotiated cap and survival limitations.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 10.4) provides that "the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and Purchaser under, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Property and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether based in contract, tort, strict liability, statute, common law or otherwise, shall be as set forth in this Section 10.4." This is a comprehensive exclusive remedy clause.
- Exclusive remedy clauses eliminate common-law remedies (tort, unjust enrichment, fraudulent concealment) that may otherwise be available to the buyer.
- If an exclusive remedy clause is accepted, insist on carve-outs for:
  - Fraud, intentional misrepresentation, and willful misconduct.
  - Equitable remedies (specific performance, injunction).
  - Post-closing proration adjustments and tenant reconciliations.
  - Claims arising under environmental laws (which may be non-waivable under CERCLA).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Indemnification is the exclusive post-closing remedy.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. Accept exclusivity but with robust carve-outs (fraud, equitable remedies, environmental, prorations).
2. Accept exclusivity with fewer carve-outs but negotiate higher cap and longer survival to compensate.
3. Accept exclusivity but ensure the indemnification mechanism itself is comprehensive: direct claims, third-party claims, defense rights, cooperation, and tolling.

### Risk Assessment

- An exclusive remedy clause without adequate carve-outs can eliminate the buyer's ability to assert tort claims, which may have different (and potentially more favorable) limitation periods, damage measures, and procedural advantages.
- The fraud carve-out is non-negotiable. No sophisticated buyer should accept an exclusive remedy clause that bars fraud claims.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No material variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Most US jurisdictions enforce exclusive remedy clauses between sophisticated commercial parties. However, courts in several jurisdictions (including New York and California) have held that exclusive remedy clauses cannot bar claims for fraud.
- CERCLA contribution and cost-recovery claims under federal environmental law may not be waivable by contract. Ensure the exclusive remedy clause does not purport to waive statutory environmental claims.

---

## Anti-Sandbagging Provisions

### Preferred Position

**Pro-sandbagging**: The buyer should be entitled to assert claims for breach of representations and warranties regardless of whether the buyer knew of the breach prior to Closing. Include an express pro-sandbagging clause: "The representations and warranties of Seller shall not be affected or diminished by any investigation or knowledge of Buyer, including any investigation conducted pursuant to the due diligence provisions of this Agreement."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The source forms demonstrate the full spectrum:
  - **Anti-sandbagging (seller-favorable)**: The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 5.4, optional text) and the Detailed Seller PSA (Section 7.4 and Section 10.4) include anti-sandbagging clauses that bar the buyer from asserting claims if the buyer "knew" of the breach at Closing. The Detailed Seller PSA goes further: "All of Seller's representations and warranties shall automatically be deemed modified to reflect Purchaser's Knowledge as of the end of the Study Period."
  - **Modified anti-sandbagging**: The Seller Income Property form (Section 7.1) waives claims if buyer "knew" and defines "deemed to have known" based on information in the Property Materials. This is a constructive knowledge standard, which is broader than actual knowledge.
  - **Pro-sandbagging (buyer-favorable)**: The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 5.3) is more buyer-friendly, allowing termination if reps are inaccurate but also preserving remedies if the inaccuracy is within seller's control. The NY Negotiation Checklist recommends: "Negotiate that the purchaser does not waive any claims for misrepresentation even if the purchaser closes."
- The distinction between "actual knowledge" and "constructive knowledge" (or "deemed knowledge") is critical. An actual-knowledge standard requires the buyer's designated individuals to have subjective awareness of the breach. A constructive-knowledge standard imputes knowledge based on information available to the buyer, which can sweep in thousands of pages of due diligence materials that no individual actually reviewed.
- The UNICO Seller Side form's anti-sandbagging provision defines buyer's deemed knowledge to include anything in the "Property Information furnished or made available to or otherwise obtained by Buyer" -- this could include the entire data room, potentially hundreds of thousands of pages.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Full anti-sandbagging with constructive knowledge.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. **Best**: Full pro-sandbagging. Buyer may assert all claims regardless of knowledge.
2. **Good**: Pro-sandbagging limited to information not provided by seller (i.e., buyer's independent investigations do not impair claims, but seller's express written disclosures may).
3. **Acceptable**: Anti-sandbagging limited to "actual knowledge" of specifically named individuals (buyer's deal lead and in-house counsel only), with no constructive knowledge or deemed knowledge standard. If the named individuals had actual, subjective knowledge of a specific breach and nevertheless closed, the claim is barred.
4. **Worst acceptable**: Anti-sandbagging with constructive knowledge, but narrowly defined: "Buyer shall be deemed to have knowledge only of information expressly and specifically set forth in the Due Diligence Materials that is directly and unambiguously inconsistent with a specific representation or warranty." Exclude general disclosures, summary documents, and third-party reports from the constructive knowledge standard.
5. **Unacceptable**: Seller's reps are "automatically deemed modified" to reflect buyer's knowledge at end of study period (Detailed Seller PSA, Section 7.4). This effectively eliminates all seller reps.

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical risk**: Anti-sandbagging provisions with broad constructive knowledge standards effectively eliminate the buyer's post-closing remedies for breach of reps. If the buyer is "deemed to know" everything in the data room, and reps are "deemed modified" accordingly, the reps become meaningless.
- This is one of the most important provisions in the entire PSA from the buyer's perspective.
- Even with a pro-sandbagging clause, buyers should document pre-closing diligence carefully and ensure that any known issues are addressed through purchase price adjustments, escrows, or specific indemnities rather than relying on post-closing rep claims.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All types**: The anti-sandbagging analysis is the same regardless of asset type. The volume of due diligence materials varies by asset type (data center and industrial deals typically involve more technical documentation), which affects the scope of constructive knowledge.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York**: New York follows a "pro-sandbagging" default rule. Absent an express anti-sandbagging clause, a buyer may assert claims even if it knew of the breach at closing. See CBS Inc. v. Ziff-Davis Publishing Co., 75 N.Y.2d 496 (1990). The NY Negotiation Checklist reflects this.
- **California**: California leans anti-sandbagging under common law. An express pro-sandbagging clause is therefore critical in California deals.
- **Delaware**: Delaware follows New York's pro-sandbagging approach for sophisticated commercial transactions. Given that most institutional seller entities are Delaware LLCs, this is relevant to entity-level disputes.
- **Illinois**: Illinois follows a general anti-sandbagging default but enforces contractual pro-sandbagging clauses.

## Merger Doctrine and Survival Carve-Outs

### Preferred Position

Include an express anti-merger clause in the PSA and ensure that all closing documents (deed, bill of sale, assignment of leases, assignment of contracts) contain parallel anti-merger language or, at minimum, do not contain merger language that contradicts the PSA.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The UNICO forms (both Buyer and Seller Side, Section 16.18) provide: "Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.4 and Section 14, the covenants, agreements, representations, and warranties made herein shall survive the Closing Date and shall not merge into the deed and its recordation in the official records or the delivery at Closing of any assignment of leases, general assignment, or bill of sale."
- The Detailed Seller PSA's deed form (Exhibit F) includes an express carve-out: "Nothing in this Deed shall prevent Grantee from relying on any representations and warranties: (i) that are expressly set forth in [the Agreement]; and (ii) that, under the terms of the Agreement, expressly survive the delivery of this Deed, subject to all time, dollar and other limitations on Grantor's liability set forth in the Agreement."
- This deed language is critical. Without it, the deed's general warranty (or lack thereof) may be construed as the buyer's sole remedy for title-related matters, and the common-law merger doctrine may extinguish other PSA-based claims.
- Ensure the anti-merger clause covers all closing documents, not just the deed. Assignments of leases, contracts, and personal property should contain no merger language.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Sellers generally accept anti-merger clauses because they benefit both parties (seller's surviving rights are also preserved). If seller resists, this is a red flag suggesting the seller intends to rely on the merger doctrine to extinguish its obligations.

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical**: Without anti-merger protection in both the PSA and closing documents, all PSA representations and warranties may be extinguished upon delivery of the deed. This would render the entire survival/indemnification framework meaningless.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No variation by asset type. Anti-merger protection is universal.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- The merger doctrine is applied in all US jurisdictions but with varying strictness. New York applies it strictly; California and Illinois are somewhat more flexible. In all jurisdictions, express anti-merger language overrides the common-law doctrine.

## Post-Closing Covenants Survival

### Preferred Position

The following post-closing covenants should survive Closing without time limitation (or with extended periods as specified):

| Covenant | Survival Period |
|---|---|
| Proration true-ups and tenant reconciliations | 18 months |
| Cooperation with buyer's financing | 12 months |
| Delinquent rent collection | Per UNICO forms: 6 months of billing obligation |
| Annual reconciliation statements | Through completion of prior-year reconciliation |
| Cooperation with tax appeals | Through resolution of pending appeals |
| Further assurances | 12 months |
| Confidentiality (if deal closes) | Terminates at Closing |
| Confidentiality (if deal terminates) | 12-24 months |
| Brokerage indemnity | Indefinite |
| Access/inspection indemnity | Indefinite |
| 1031 exchange cooperation | Through completion of exchange |
| ERISA compliance | Through completion of applicable audit |

### Key Negotiation Points

- The UNICO forms provide detailed post-closing obligations: Section 7.5 (delinquent rents -- 6 months billing obligation), Section 7.7 (annual reconciliation statements -- survives Closing), Section 9.3 (cooperation with buyer's financing -- survives but is not a condition to closing).
- Push for an express list of surviving covenants in the PSA to avoid disputes about which obligations survive.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Sellers may resist open-ended or indefinite survival of post-closing covenants. Fallback: accept time-limited survival for each covenant but ensure the time limits are sufficient for the specific obligation.

### Risk Assessment

- Post-closing covenant survival is often overlooked in negotiation but can be critically important. Failure to preserve the proration true-up obligation, for example, can cost the buyer significant amounts if tax or operating expense reconciliations reveal discrepancies.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail**: Percentage rent reconciliations may require 18+ months of survival.
- **Office**: Operating expense reconciliations typically require 12-18 months.
- **Industrial**: Simpler operating structures may permit shorter survival (12 months).
- **Multifamily**: Utility reconciliations and rent-regulated compliance may require extended survival.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- No jurisdiction-specific variation. Post-closing covenant survival is a matter of contract drafting.

---

## Escrow/Holdback for Post-Closing Claims

### Preferred Position

Require a post-closing escrow or holdback of 3% to 5% of the Purchase Price, held by an independent escrow agent for 12 to 18 months after Closing, to secure seller's indemnification obligations.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The NY Negotiation Checklist recommends: "Negotiate that the seller must post security in case the representations and warranties turn out to be false after the closing. The seller may: deposit funds in escrow; give a letter of credit; or give a guarantee by a corporate parent. Negotiate for the largest possible security amount, which could be between 1% to 10% of the purchase price."
- The escrow provides the buyer with actual recourse against a fund of money, rather than relying on the seller entity's solvency and willingness to pay post-closing claims. This is particularly important given seller entity dissolution risk (see below).
- Structure: The escrow should be released in stages (e.g., 50% at 6 months, remaining 50% at 12-18 months, subject to retention for pending claims). Pending claims should be retained in escrow until resolved.
- Alternative to escrow: A letter of credit or parent guaranty can serve the same function without tying up the seller's sale proceeds.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: No escrow. The buyer's remedies are limited to claims against the seller entity.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If seller refuses escrow, demand a parent or manager guaranty of seller's indemnification obligations up to the cap amount.
2. If seller refuses a guaranty, demand a letter of credit in an amount equal to the cap.
3. If all security mechanisms are refused, negotiate a higher cap and longer survival to compensate for the increased credit risk.
4. If the seller is a single-purpose entity (common in institutional deals), an escrow or guaranty is essential. Point out that the seller entity may be dissolved shortly after closing (see below), leaving the buyer with no recourse.
5. As a deal-structural alternative, negotiate a purchase price reduction equal to the buyer's estimated uninsured risk exposure.

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical**: Without an escrow, holdback, letter of credit, or guaranty, the buyer's post-closing indemnification rights are only as good as the seller entity's assets and solvency. In institutional deals, the seller is typically a single-purpose LLC with no assets other than the property being sold. After closing, the seller may have no assets against which to enforce a judgment.

### Asset-Type Variations

- Consistent across all asset types. The need for an escrow is driven by deal structure (seller entity type) rather than asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Escrow and holdback provisions are universally enforceable. No jurisdiction-specific limitations.
- In New York, the title company or seller's attorney typically serves as escrow agent. In western states, the title company is the standard escrow agent.

---

## Seller Entity Dissolution Risk and Guarantor Requirements

### Preferred Position

- **Anti-dissolution covenant**: Seller covenants not to dissolve, liquidate, wind up, or distribute all or substantially all of its assets for a period equal to the longer of (a) the survival period, or (b) 18 months after Closing.
- **Guaranty**: An affiliate, parent entity, or manager of seller guarantees seller's indemnification obligations up to the cap amount for the duration of the survival period.
- **Asset maintenance covenant**: Seller covenants to maintain assets sufficient to satisfy its indemnification obligations for the duration of the survival period.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The NY Negotiation Checklist recommends: "Negotiate that the seller entity cannot be dissolved or wound-up either: for an agreed period (such as six months or one year) after the closing; or at any time while the purchaser is enforcing its rights under the purchase and sale agreement against the seller entity."
- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.16) limits buyer's recourse to "Seller's interest in the Property (or, following the Closing, to the net proceeds of the sale of the Property actually received by Seller)." This is a critical limitation: once proceeds are distributed (which can happen immediately after closing), the buyer has no recourse.
- Push for a "springing guaranty" that activates if seller dissolves or distributes its assets before the survival period expires.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: No guaranty, no anti-dissolution covenant. Buyer's recourse is limited to the seller entity.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. Demand anti-dissolution covenant for the duration of the survival period.
2. If seller refuses anti-dissolution, demand a parent/manager guaranty.
3. If seller refuses a guaranty, demand an escrow or holdback (see above).
4. If all of the above are refused, insist that seller's post-closing liability is secured by a right of offset against any amounts owed by buyer to seller (e.g., post-closing proration adjustments).
5. At minimum, include a covenant that seller will provide buyer with 30 days' advance written notice of any intended dissolution or distribution, during which period buyer may accelerate and assert any pending or anticipated claims.

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical**: The single-purpose entity structure, which is standard in institutional real estate, creates a fundamental credit risk for buyers. A seller SPE that distributes its sale proceeds and dissolves renders all indemnification rights worthless.
- This risk is compounded by the recourse limitation in the Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.16), which expressly limits buyer's recovery to seller's interest in the property (pre-closing) or net proceeds (post-closing).

### Asset-Type Variations

- Risk is consistent across all asset types and is driven by entity structure rather than asset type.
- In portfolio deals, the risk is magnified because each property-level seller may be a separate SPE.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Delaware law (under which most institutional seller entities are organized) permits rapid dissolution of LLCs. A Delaware LLC can file a Certificate of Cancellation and dissolve within days of closing.
- Anti-dissolution covenants are enforceable contractual obligations. However, enforcing them after dissolution may require pursuing the dissolved entity's members or managers, which can be procedurally complex.
- The DLLCA (Delaware Limited Liability Company Act) provides for continuation of a dissolved LLC for purposes of winding up, including satisfying claims. However, this provides limited practical protection if assets have been distributed.

---

## Mitigation Obligations

### Preferred Position

Include a mutual mitigation obligation: each party must take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate its damages arising from a breach by the other party. However, the mitigation obligation should not be used to shift the cost of remediation or cure from the breaching party to the non-breaching party.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Mitigation is an implied obligation under the common law of most jurisdictions, but an express contractual provision provides clarity and avoids disputes.
- Define "commercially reasonable" mitigation: the non-breaching party must take steps that a reasonable person in the same position would take, but is not required to incur material expense, assume material risk, or prejudice its rights.
- Ensure that mitigation costs incurred by the non-breaching party are recoverable as part of the indemnification claim.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Sellers generally welcome mitigation obligations because they limit potential liability. The buyer's primary concern is ensuring that mitigation does not become a pretext for the seller to argue that the buyer failed to mitigate and thereby bar or reduce the claim.

**Fallback**: Accept a mitigation obligation but add: "The obligation to mitigate shall not require Buyer to incur out-of-pocket costs in excess of $[amount], to commence or participate in litigation, or to take any action that would materially impair Buyer's use, enjoyment, or operation of the Property."

### Risk Assessment

- Moderate. Mitigation obligations can be weaponized by sellers to reduce or eliminate claims. Clear contractual language limiting the scope of mitigation is the best protection.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No material variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Mitigation is a common-law obligation in all US jurisdictions. Contractual provisions override the default rule, so careful drafting is important.

---

## Tax Indemnification

### Preferred Position

- Seller indemnifies buyer for all transfer taxes, documentary stamps, recording fees, and similar charges arising from the conveyance of the Property to the extent such charges are seller's responsibility under applicable law or the PSA.
- Seller indemnifies buyer for any reassessment, rollback, or escape assessment of property taxes attributable to seller's period of ownership or arising from the change of ownership at Closing.
- Survival: Coextensive with the applicable statute of limitations for the relevant tax, including all extensions.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 8.4) includes a buyer indemnification of seller for property tax reassessment: "If the Property has been assessed for property tax purposes at such rates as would result in reassessment (i.e., 'escape assessment' or 'roll-back taxes') based upon the change in land usage or ownership of the Property on or after the Closing Date, Purchaser hereby agrees to pay all such taxes and to indemnify and save Seller harmless." This is seller-favorable. Push for the opposite: seller should bear reassessment costs attributable to events during seller's ownership.
- FIRPTA withholding: The UNICO forms (both Buyer and Seller Side) require seller to deliver a non-foreign person certificate. If seller fails to deliver, buyer must withhold. Include indemnification for buyer's costs and liabilities if seller fails to deliver a compliant certificate.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Reassessment taxes arising from the sale itself are buyer's responsibility (because the sale triggers the reassessment).

**Fallback**: Accept that reassessments triggered solely by the change of ownership are buyer's responsibility, but seller indemnifies for reassessments triggered by events during seller's ownership (e.g., unpermitted improvements, incorrect reporting, failure to apply for exemptions).

### Risk Assessment

- In jurisdictions with Proposition 13-type reassessment regimes (California) or similar change-of-ownership triggers, the tax impact of a sale can be enormous. Ensure the PSA clearly allocates this risk.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **California commercial properties**: Prop 13 reassessment is the primary concern. Annual property taxes can increase dramatically upon sale.
- **New York City**: Transfer taxes (RPTT and state transfer tax) are significant. Ensure allocation is clear.
- **All types in all jurisdictions**: Ensure prorations and allocations are specifically addressed.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Property tax reassessment is jurisdiction-specific. California, Oregon, and several other states have reassessment triggers on change of ownership. Ensure the PSA accounts for the specific jurisdiction's regime.
- FIRPTA withholding applies nationally. The non-foreign person certificate is standard.

---

## Environmental Indemnification

### Preferred Position

Despite the as-is clause, push for a limited environmental indemnification covering:

- **Pre-existing conditions known to seller**: Seller indemnifies buyer for remediation costs arising from Hazardous Materials conditions that (a) existed prior to Closing, (b) were known to seller (or should have been known based on seller's operation of the Property), and (c) were not disclosed to buyer.
- **Ongoing seller-caused contamination**: If seller's operations (including tenant operations under leases entered into by seller) caused or contributed to contamination, seller indemnifies buyer for resulting remediation costs.
- **Third-party claims**: Seller indemnifies buyer for third-party claims (including government enforcement actions) arising from pre-closing environmental conditions.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The as-is clause in every source form includes an environmental release. The Meadows form (Section 4.6) waives "all claims and liability, including Environmental Liability." The Seller Income Property form (Section 7.4) releases seller "of and from any environmental claims" but carves out "reimbursement or contribution claims which Buyer may have against Seller under any state or federal laws regarding the release of any hazardous substances on the Property caused by Seller."
- This Seller Income Property carve-out is the buyer's starting position: even with a broad environmental release, preserve CERCLA contribution rights and claims for seller-caused contamination.
- Environmental indemnification should survive for at least 36 months and should not be subject to the general liability cap (or should have a separate, higher cap).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: No environmental indemnification. The as-is clause and environmental release cover everything. Buyer has had full opportunity for Phase I/II environmental assessment during diligence.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. Accept the as-is clause and environmental release but preserve CERCLA contribution rights (which may not be contractually waivable in many jurisdictions).
2. Negotiate a "known conditions" indemnity: seller indemnifies only for conditions that were known to seller and not disclosed. This is narrow and difficult for the seller to resist.
3. Negotiate a separate environmental escrow funded from the Purchase Price, to be used for remediation of pre-existing conditions discovered within 36 months of Closing.
4. If the seller refuses all environmental indemnification, require environmental insurance (pollution legal liability policy) as a condition to closing, with seller bearing the premium cost.

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical for industrial and older properties**: Environmental remediation costs can easily exceed the entire Purchase Price. Even a Phase I/II assessment conducted during diligence may not reveal all contamination.
- **Lower risk for newer office and multifamily**: But not zero -- even new construction can have contamination from prior site uses.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Industrial**: Highest environmental risk. Push for maximum environmental indemnification and extended survival.
- **Data centers**: Elevated risk from cooling chemicals, diesel fuel, and battery systems.
- **Retail**: Moderate risk, particularly for properties with dry cleaners, gas stations, or auto service tenants.
- **Office**: Lower risk but not negligible, particularly for older buildings with asbestos, lead paint, or PCBs.
- **Multifamily**: Risk profile similar to office for older buildings; lower for new construction.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **CERCLA (federal)**: CERCLA liability is strict, joint, and several. Contractual waivers between buyer and seller do not affect government enforcement actions. Contractual indemnification provides only a right of recovery from the seller, not a defense against EPA.
- **California**: California's Hazardous Substance Account Act imposes strict liability. Contractual releases may not bar DTSC enforcement.
- **New York**: New York's Environmental Conservation Law imposes independent liability. Contractual releases between buyer and seller do not affect state enforcement.
- **Oregon**: Oregon DEQ can pursue current owners for pre-existing contamination. The Meadows form's environmental release does not affect government claims.
- **Illinois**: Illinois EPA can pursue current owners. The IL Pro-Buyer form should address this.

---

## Recourse Limitations and Personal Liability Shields

### Preferred Position

Accept standard non-recourse provisions that limit claims to the seller entity (not its individual members, managers, officers, or directors), but ensure that:

- The seller entity maintains sufficient assets or security (escrow, guaranty) to satisfy indemnification obligations during the survival period.
- Fraud and intentional misrepresentation carve out individual liability protections.
- The non-recourse provision does not limit claims against a parent guarantor.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.16) limits recourse to "Seller's interest in the Property (or, following the Closing, to the net proceeds of the sale of the Property actually received by Seller)" and provides that "no negative capital account or any contribution or payment obligation of any partner or member of Seller shall constitute an asset of Seller." This is highly seller-favorable and effectively limits recovery to what the seller has not yet distributed.
- The Meadows form (Section 9.12, Exculpation) similarly shields all individuals from personal liability.
- Both buyer and seller forms include mutual non-recourse provisions (see UNICO Buyer Side and Detailed Seller PSA, Section 11.16(b)).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Full non-recourse with no exceptions.

**Fallback**: Accept non-recourse but insist on (a) fraud/intentional misrepresentation carve-out for individuals who participated in the fraud, (b) a guaranty from a creditworthy entity (manager, parent, fund), and (c) an anti-dissolution covenant for the seller entity.

### Risk Assessment

- Non-recourse provisions are market standard and generally non-negotiable in institutional deals. The real protection comes from the escrow, guaranty, and anti-dissolution provisions that ensure the seller entity has assets available during the survival period.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Non-recourse provisions are universally enforceable. Delaware LLC law provides robust liability shields for members and managers. New York LLC law is similar.
- Fraud carve-outs for individuals are enforceable in all jurisdictions.
