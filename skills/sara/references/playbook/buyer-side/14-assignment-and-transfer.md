# Assignment and Transfer -- Buyer Playbook

This section governs the buyer's ability to assign or transfer its rights and obligations under the PSA before closing, the seller's corresponding rights, and the mechanics of structuring the ultimate acquisition entity. In institutional commercial real estate acquisitions ($50M+), assignment flexibility is critical for buyers who routinely acquire through single-purpose entities (SPEs), need to accommodate investor co-investment structures, plan 1031 exchanges, or deploy capital through tenancy-in-common (TIC) or Delaware Statutory Trust (DST) structures. The assignment clause directly affects deal certainty for the seller while preserving essential structural flexibility for the buyer. Overly restrictive assignment language can blow up a transaction at the eleventh hour when the buyer's fund counsel determines the acquisition entity must differ from the PSA signatory.

## Buyer's Right to Assign the PSA

### Preferred Position

Secure the broadest possible right to assign the PSA without seller consent, subject only to narrow, objective conditions. The ideal clause reads:

- Buyer may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any Affiliate of Buyer, any SPE formed by or on behalf of Buyer for the purpose of acquiring the Property, any designee entity identified by Buyer, or any qualified intermediary or exchange accommodation titleholder in connection with a 1031 exchange, without the prior consent of Seller.
- Assignment to non-Affiliates should require seller consent, but that consent should be subject to a reasonableness standard (not sole discretion).
- The right to assign should be unconditional -- not contingent on the expiration of the due diligence period, the posting of additional deposits, or any other precondition.

The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 16.6) provides a strong model: after the buyer elects to proceed following due diligence, it may assign without consent to Affiliates and to third parties under a TIC structure (provided an Affiliate serves as property manager). The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 16.6) is more restrictive, permitting assignment only to Affiliates without consent.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Resist any requirement that assignment be conditioned on expiration of the due diligence period. The UNICO forms condition consent-free assignment on buyer having "elect[ed] to proceed with the acquisition of the Property following the Due Diligence Period." While this is common, it restricts pre-due-diligence structural planning and forces the buyer to sign the PSA before the acquisition entity is finalized. Push for consent-free Affiliate assignment at any time.
- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3) requires seller consent "in its sole discretion" with a narrow carve-out requiring 51% common ownership and control. This is the seller's maximum position. Buyer should counter with a broader carve-out that captures the full range of typical institutional structures.
- Ensure the assignment right extends to partial assignments (i.e., assignment of a fractional interest to a co-investor or TIC participant). The UNICO Buyer Side form expressly permits partial assignment -- this is a critical feature for co-investment deals.
- Assignment should not require any increase or mark-up of the purchase price. The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3(d)) includes this protection -- adopt it universally.
- Push for the right to designate the acquisition entity up to and including the closing date, not merely a fixed period before closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: No assignment without seller's prior written consent, which may be withheld in seller's sole and absolute discretion, with a narrow carve-out for controlled Affiliates only. This is the position in the UNICO Seller Side form, the Detailed Seller PSA, and the Meadows form.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If seller insists on a consent requirement for non-Affiliate assignments, accept this but negotiate a reasonableness standard with deemed approval if seller does not respond within 5 business days of receiving the assignment notice and supporting documentation.
2. If seller insists on sole discretion for non-Affiliates, accept sole discretion but broaden the definition of "Affiliate" (see below) and add express carve-outs for (a) SPEs wholly owned by Buyer or its principals, (b) 1031 exchange entities, and (c) TIC co-investors where an Affiliate of Buyer serves as managing co-tenant or property manager.
3. If seller will not expand the Affiliate carve-out, negotiate for a "designee" right that permits Buyer to designate the grantee on the deed at closing without formal assignment of the PSA, provided the designee assumes all obligations. This avoids triggering the assignment clause altogether.
4. As a final fallback, accept the narrow Affiliate-only carve-out but ensure the definition of Affiliate is sufficiently broad (see Definition of Affiliate section below) and secure an express acknowledgment that formation of a new SPE by the same principals does not constitute an "assignment."

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk if assignment requires sole-discretion consent with no carve-outs**: Buyer may be unable to close through the intended acquisition entity, causing either a forced restructuring at closing or a default. In fund transactions, the specific acquisition entity is often not determined until weeks before closing.
- **Moderate risk if Affiliate carve-out is too narrow**: A 51% ownership threshold (as in the Detailed Seller PSA) may not accommodate fund structures where the GP/manager holds a small carried interest and investors hold the majority economic interest. The UNICO Buyer Side form addresses this by deeming an entity an Affiliate if Unico Investment Group LLC serves as manager or holds as little as 2.5-5% of total interests.
- **Low risk if broad Affiliate carve-out is secured**: Most institutional buyers close through controlled Affiliates, and a well-drafted Affiliate definition covers virtually all anticipated structures.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office/industrial**: Standard assignment provisions are generally sufficient. Sellers are accustomed to institutional buyers assigning to SPEs.
- **Multifamily**: Assignment flexibility is especially important for buyers deploying Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae financing, which often requires the borrowing entity to be a single-purpose, bankruptcy-remote entity that may differ from the PSA signatory. Ensure the assignment right expressly accommodates lender-required entity restructuring.
- **Data centers**: Seller may push back on assignment to entities that compete with the seller's data center operations. Negotiate a carve-out from any non-compete or restricted-assignee provisions for Affiliates.
- **Retail**: In ground-lease and master-lease structures, the landlord's consent to assignment of the ground lease or master lease must be coordinated with the PSA assignment -- ensure the PSA assignment clause accounts for any landlord consent requirements at the property level.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Delaware**: Most institutional SPEs are Delaware LLCs or LPs. Delaware's LLC Act (6 Del. C. Section 18-702) and LP Act (6 Del. C. Section 17-702) govern assignment of membership and partnership interests respectively. Ensure the PSA assignment clause does not inadvertently conflict with the operating agreement of the assignee entity.
- **New York**: In New York City, assignment of a PSA for property subject to a ground lease or ICAP benefits may trigger consent requirements beyond the PSA itself. Transfer taxes under NYC Admin. Code Section 11-2102 apply to assignments of economic interests in entities holding NYC real property -- evaluate whether the assignment triggers a transfer tax event.
- **California**: Documentary transfer tax may apply to certain assignments. Cal. Rev. & Tax Code Section 11911 et seq. should be analyzed to determine whether assignment of the PSA (as opposed to the property itself) triggers tax.
- **Oregon**: The Meadows form (Oregon property) flatly prohibits assignment without seller consent. Oregon does not impose a transfer tax, reducing one friction point on assignment.
- **Texas**: Texas does not have a state income tax, but assignment into a TIC structure must comply with Texas Business Organizations Code requirements for the TIC entity.

## Definition of "Affiliate" for Assignment Purposes

### Preferred Position

Negotiate the broadest commercially reasonable definition of "Affiliate" to maximize assignment flexibility without triggering seller consent requirements:

- **Control-based definition**: Any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Buyer or any principal of Buyer. This is the standard formulation used in both UNICO forms (Section 16.4).
- **"Control" should mean**: The possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. This is broader than a pure equity-ownership test.
- **Low ownership thresholds**: The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 16.4) includes a critical qualifier: any LLC or partnership in which Unico Investment Group LLC either (i) serves as manager/managing member or general partner, or (ii) holds as little as 2.5% of total interests, qualifies as an Affiliate. Push for similar language keyed to the buyer's management platform, not merely equity ownership.
- **Include fund vehicles**: Expressly include any fund, investment vehicle, or account managed, advised, or sub-advised by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, including any parallel fund, co-investment vehicle, or alternative investment vehicle.
- **Include SPEs**: Expressly include any single-purpose entity formed by or at the direction of Buyer or an Affiliate for the purpose of acquiring, holding, or financing the Property.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3(a)) requires the assignee to be "controlled by Purchaser or the owners of Purchaser as of the Effective Date" with "at least a fifty-one percent (51%) interest" held directly or indirectly. This is a seller-favorable, narrow definition that excludes many common fund structures. Counter by replacing the 51% test with a management-control test.
- The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 16.4) uses a clean control-based definition without specifying an ownership threshold -- this is the preferred formulation for sellers who will accept a standard Affiliate definition.
- Ensure the definition captures both "upstream" Affiliates (entities that control Buyer) and "downstream" Affiliates (entities controlled by Buyer), as well as "lateral" Affiliates (entities under common control with Buyer through a shared parent).
- If the buyer is a private equity fund, ensure the definition includes the fund's general partner, its management company, and any co-investment or sidecar vehicle.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Standard control-based definition with a 50%+ equity ownership requirement. The Detailed Seller PSA's 51% threshold is representative.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If seller insists on an ownership threshold, negotiate it down to 25% or lower, provided the buyer or its management platform retains management control (managing member, general partner, or contractual management authority).
2. If seller will not go below 50%, add a separate carve-out for entities managed by the same management platform (e.g., "any entity as to which [Buyer Management Co.] or an Affiliate thereof serves as the property manager, asset manager, or investment manager").
3. If seller insists on the 51% threshold, add a "designee" right (separate from the Affiliate assignment right) that permits Buyer to name a non-Affiliate as the grantee at closing, subject to that designee assuming all obligations and original Buyer remaining liable.
4. As a final fallback, accept the narrow definition but secure a side letter listing specific anticipated assignee entities that are pre-approved.

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk if the Affiliate definition is purely equity-based at 50%+**: In typical institutional fund structures, the GP/manager entity holds 1-20% of the economic interest. A 51% equity threshold effectively defeats the Affiliate assignment right for most fund buyers.
- **Moderate risk if the definition excludes fund vehicles**: Parallel funds, sidecar vehicles, and co-investment entities are standard in institutional real estate. Exclusion forces consent requests for routine structural decisions.
- **Low risk with a management-control-based definition**: This captures virtually all anticipated acquisition structures while still giving the seller assurance that a known counterparty controls the assignee.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types**: The Affiliate definition is generally asset-type agnostic. The key variable is the buyer's organizational structure, not the property type.
- **Data centers**: Sellers may push for a narrower Affiliate definition to prevent assignment to competing operators. Resist this as anticompetitive and address competition concerns through separate non-compete provisions if necessary.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Delaware**: The UNICO Buyer Side form's express inclusion of entities where Unico "directly or indirectly serves as a manager, operating as managing member or general partner" tracks Delaware LLC and LP governance structures. Ensure the Affiliate definition aligns with the governance provisions of the assignee entity's operating agreement or partnership agreement.
- **California**: Cal. Corp. Code Section 150 defines "affiliate" for securities law purposes. While not directly applicable to PSA assignments, sophisticated California sellers may invoke this definition as a negotiating anchor.
- **All jurisdictions**: The Affiliate definition should be self-contained in the PSA and should not incorporate by reference any statutory definition, as statutory definitions may change and are often too narrow for commercial real estate purposes.

## Seller Consent Requirements for Assignment

### Preferred Position

Eliminate seller consent requirements entirely for Affiliate assignments, 1031 exchange assignments, and intra-fund restructurings. For non-Affiliate assignments, negotiate a reasonableness standard with procedural protections:

- Seller consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.
- Seller shall respond to any assignment request within 5 business days of receipt of the request together with reasonable supporting documentation regarding the assignee.
- If seller fails to respond within such period, consent shall be deemed granted.
- Seller may not withhold consent based on the financial capacity of the assignee if (a) original Buyer remains jointly and severally liable, or (b) the assignee provides a guaranty from an entity with a net worth of at least $[amount] or provides substitute earnest money or other credit support.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The Meadows form (Section 9.11) gives seller absolute discretion over assignment consent ("which Seller may withhold"). This is the most seller-favorable position and should be resisted.
- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3) also uses sole discretion as the baseline but carves out Affiliate assignments. This two-tier approach (sole discretion for non-Affiliates, consent-free for Affiliates) is the most common institutional structure.
- The UNICO forms take a middle approach: sole discretion as the default, but with automatic consent-free carve-outs for Affiliates (and, in the Buyer Side form, TIC structures).
- Resist any requirement that the assignee post additional earnest money or provide enhanced credit support as a condition of seller consent -- this converts the consent requirement into a de facto economic renegotiation.
- Ensure that seller's consent to an assignment does not constitute a waiver of any representation, warranty, or condition precedent.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Sole discretion over all non-Affiliate assignments, no deemed-consent provisions, no reasonableness standard.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If seller insists on sole discretion for non-Affiliates, accept this but negotiate a broad Affiliate definition and express carve-outs for 1031 exchange entities, SPEs, and TIC structures.
2. If seller will not include TIC/1031 carve-outs, negotiate a separate "1031 cooperation" clause (see below) that effectively permits assignment to a qualified intermediary without triggering the assignment restrictions.
3. If seller insists on sole discretion even for Affiliates, negotiate for a "not to be unreasonably withheld" standard for Affiliates only, with sole discretion remaining for non-Affiliates.
4. As a final fallback, accept sole discretion across the board but secure an express acknowledgment that (a) the formation of a new SPE by Buyer's principals is not an assignment, (b) the designation of a grantee on the deed is not an assignment, and (c) changes in the indirect ownership of Buyer above the Buyer entity level are not assignments.

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical risk if sole discretion applies to all assignments including Affiliates**: Seller can block legitimate structural decisions, potentially holding the buyer hostage for economic concessions at closing.
- **High risk if there is no deemed-consent or response-deadline provision**: Seller can simply fail to respond to an assignment request, creating uncertainty as the closing date approaches.
- **Moderate risk with a reasonableness standard**: Disputes over "reasonableness" are fact-intensive and difficult to resolve on a pre-closing timeline.
- **Low risk if Affiliate assignments are consent-free**: This covers the vast majority of institutional assignments.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily**: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac borrower requirements may necessitate assignment to a specific entity structure. Ensure seller consent cannot be withheld if the assignment is required by the buyer's lender.
- **Retail**: In portfolio deals involving multiple retail properties, buyer may need to assign individual properties to separate SPEs. Ensure the assignment clause permits partial assignments (assignment of rights as to a specific property within a portfolio) without triggering consent for the entire agreement.
- **Data centers**: Seller-operators may condition consent on the assignee not being a competitor. If such a restriction is accepted, ensure it is narrowly defined (e.g., limited to the top 5 data center operators by revenue in the same geographic market).

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York**: NYC RPT transfer tax considerations may affect assignment structuring. An assignment of the PSA itself (as opposed to a change in the grantee on the deed) may not trigger transfer tax if no consideration is paid for the assignment.
- **Illinois**: Illinois courts generally enforce sole-discretion consent provisions in commercial contracts. If the deal is in Illinois, push harder for contractual protections (deemed consent, response deadlines) rather than relying on judicial reasonableness review.
- **California**: California courts may imply a duty of good faith and fair dealing even where the contract provides for sole discretion. However, relying on this implied duty is uncertain -- negotiate express protections instead.

## Conditions on Permitted Assignments (Original Buyer Liability and Assignee Assumption)

### Preferred Position

Negotiate the narrowest possible conditions on permitted assignments while accepting reasonable protections for the seller:

- **Assignee assumption**: The assignee must assume all of Buyer's obligations under the PSA by written instrument delivered to Seller. This is universally required and should be accepted. The UNICO forms, the Detailed Seller PSA, and the Seller Income Property form all require assumption.
- **Original Buyer liability**: Resist joint and several liability of the original Buyer post-assignment. The preferred position is that a valid assignment and assumption releases the original Buyer from all obligations accruing after the assignment date.
- **No mark-up**: The assignment must not involve any increase in the purchase price. The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3(d)) includes this requirement -- it protects the seller from being drawn into a flip transaction.
- **ERISA and AML compliance**: The assignee must be able to make the same ERISA and anti-money-laundering representations as the original Buyer. The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3(c)) includes this requirement -- it is reasonable and should be accepted.
- **Notice**: Buyer shall provide seller with notice of the assignment, including the legal name and signature block of the assignee, within a reasonable period before closing. Negotiate for the shortest practicable notice period (2 business days per the UNICO forms, rather than 5 or 10 days).

### Key Negotiation Points

- The most heavily contested condition is whether the original Buyer remains liable after assignment. Every precedent form reviewed requires ongoing liability: the UNICO forms state "No assignment by Buyer shall release it from any liability hereunder" (Section 16.6); the Detailed Seller PSA requires joint and several liability (Section 11.3(b)); and the Meadows form states "No such assignment or transfer shall release Buyer from any obligation or liability under this Agreement" (Section 9.11). Despite this market consensus, buyer's counsel should negotiate for a release upon closing if the assignment is to a creditworthy Affiliate.
- The Detailed Seller PSA requires that the study period have ended before any permitted assignment (Section 11.3(e)). Resist this -- structural decisions about the acquisition entity should not be artificially linked to the due diligence timeline.
- Ensure the assumption instrument is in a form "reasonably acceptable" to seller (not in seller's sole discretion). The Detailed Seller PSA uses "reasonably acceptable" -- this is appropriate.
- Require seller to execute any documents reasonably necessary to effectuate the assignment, including updated closing documents reflecting the assignee as the grantee, buyer under assignments, and borrower under any loan documents.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Assignee assumes all obligations; original Buyer remains jointly and severally liable; assignment does not extend any deadlines or modify any terms; study period must have ended; 5+ business days' notice required.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If seller insists on ongoing original Buyer liability, accept this for pre-closing obligations but negotiate a release for post-closing obligations upon closing (i.e., original Buyer remains liable for pre-closing defaults and deposit forfeiture, but post-closing indemnification and rep survival claims run only against the assignee).
2. If seller insists on full joint and several liability for all obligations, accept this but negotiate a sunset on original Buyer liability (e.g., original Buyer's liability terminates 12 months after closing or upon the expiration of the survival period, whichever is later).
3. If seller will not agree to any limitation on original Buyer liability, ensure the assignment instrument includes a contribution right between original Buyer and assignee, so original Buyer has contractual recourse against the assignee if seller makes a claim against original Buyer post-closing.
4. As a final fallback, accept full, unlimited joint and several liability but negotiate for notice and cure rights: seller must give original Buyer notice of any claim against the assignee and original Buyer must have 15 business days to cure before seller can pursue original Buyer directly.

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk if original Buyer remains fully liable indefinitely**: The buyer bears exposure for the acts and omissions of the assignee without temporal limitation. In fund transactions, the fund vehicle that signed the PSA may not have a continuing relationship with the property post-closing.
- **Moderate risk if study-period-expiration is a precondition**: Buyer cannot finalize the entity structure until after due diligence, which may not align with actual structural planning timelines.
- **Low risk from assumption and notice requirements**: These are standard and appropriate protections for the seller.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily**: In affordable housing or LIHTC transactions, the assignee entity must comply with the regulatory agreement and extended use agreement. Ensure the PSA conditions on permitted assignment do not conflict with these regulatory requirements.
- **Industrial/logistics**: In sale-leaseback transactions, the seller-tenant may insist that the assignee meet specific financial covenants. Coordinate the PSA assignment conditions with the lease assignment provisions.
- **Office**: In build-to-suit or pre-development acquisitions, the seller may condition assignment on the assignee assuming development obligations and posting replacement guaranties.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions**: The principle that an assignment does not release the assignor without the other party's consent is generally supported by common law. Contractual language is therefore necessary to override this default rule if a release is desired.
- **Delaware**: Delaware courts enforce contractual provisions regarding ongoing assignor liability. 6 Del. C. Section 18-702(b)(3) provides that an assignor remains liable for obligations arising before the assignment unless otherwise agreed.
- **New York**: New York courts strictly enforce no-release-upon-assignment provisions. If the buyer wants a release, it must be express and unambiguous.

---

## Seller's Right to Assign

### Preferred Position

Restrict seller's right to assign the PSA as tightly as possible:

- Seller shall not assign this Agreement or any interest herein without Buyer's prior written consent, which may be withheld in Buyer's sole and absolute discretion.
- No carve-out for Affiliate assignments by seller (or, if a carve-out is accepted, require that the assignee assume all seller obligations and that seller remain jointly and severally liable).
- Any assignment by seller without buyer's consent shall be void and shall constitute a default by seller under the Agreement.

The buyer's interest in restricting seller assignment is to ensure that (a) the buyer's counterparty does not change mid-transaction, (b) the buyer's due diligence on the seller entity remains valid, (c) any representations and warranties run to a known and creditworthy counterparty, and (d) the buyer's title insurance commitment is not affected.

### Key Negotiation Points

- None of the reviewed precedent forms contain detailed seller assignment provisions -- assignment restrictions in these forms run exclusively against the buyer/purchaser. This absence itself is instructive: sellers typically draft the PSA and omit restrictions on their own assignment rights.
- The "Successors and Assigns" clause in all reviewed forms (UNICO Buyer Side Section 16.5; UNICO Seller Side Section 16.5; Detailed Seller PSA Section 11.2; Seller Income Property Section 18; Meadows Section 9.11) binds successors and "permitted assigns" but does not define what constitutes a "permitted" assign for the seller.
- Push for express language: "Seller shall not assign this Agreement without Buyer's prior written consent." In the absence of such language, the default common law rule in most jurisdictions permits assignment of contract rights unless the contract provides otherwise.
- If seller resists an express prohibition, at minimum require that any seller assignment be subject to (a) the assignee assuming all seller obligations, (b) seller remaining jointly and severally liable for all pre-assignment obligations, and (c) buyer's title commitment not being adversely affected.
- Ensure the deed, bill of sale, and assignment documents will be executed by the original seller entity (or an entity acceptable to the title company), regardless of any PSA assignment.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Silence on seller assignment (the default in most seller-drafted forms), or, if pressed, a right to assign to Affiliates without buyer consent.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If seller insists on the right to assign to Affiliates without consent, accept this but require (a) 10 business days' prior written notice, (b) assignee's written assumption of all seller obligations, (c) seller's ongoing joint and several liability, and (d) buyer's right to receive an updated title commitment at seller's expense reflecting the assignee as the titleholder/grantor.
2. If seller will not accept ongoing liability, require the seller's assignee to have a net worth at least equal to the seller as of the effective date, and require the assignee to deliver a guaranty from a creditworthy parent or sponsor.
3. If seller resists all conditions, negotiate for a termination right: if seller assigns the PSA without buyer's consent, buyer may terminate the Agreement and receive a return of the deposit plus reimbursement of documented out-of-pocket due diligence costs.
4. As a final fallback, accept silent assignment provisions but add a condition precedent to buyer's obligation to close that "Seller is the same entity as on the Effective Date, or any successor-in-interest has assumed all of Seller's obligations in a manner reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the Title Company."

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical risk if seller assigns to an uncreditworthy entity**: Buyer loses its recourse for post-closing representation and warranty claims, indemnification obligations, and proration true-ups.
- **High risk if seller assigns to an entity that does not have good title**: The conveyance chain is broken, and the title company may refuse to issue the title policy.
- **Moderate risk if seller assigns to a legitimate Affiliate**: If the Affiliate is part of the same institutional platform, the risk is primarily procedural (updated title commitment, updated closing documents) rather than substantive.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types**: The risk from seller assignment is primarily counterparty credit risk, which is asset-type agnostic. The critical analysis is whether the seller's assignee can deliver good title and honor post-closing obligations.
- **Multifamily (affordable)**: In LIHTC and HUD-financed properties, seller assignment may trigger regulatory consent requirements. Ensure the PSA addresses coordination with the housing authority or regulatory body.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions**: Under the common law of most U.S. states, contract rights are generally assignable unless the contract provides otherwise or the assignment would materially change the other party's duty or risk. Contractual restrictions on seller assignment are therefore critical.
- **New York**: New York courts enforce anti-assignment provisions strictly but construe them narrowly. An anti-assignment clause that prohibits "assignment" may not prevent a change of control of the seller entity (see Change of Control section below).
- **Delaware**: Delaware follows the common law rule permitting assignment unless restricted by contract. 6 Del. C. Section 2-210 (applicable to sales of goods by analogy) permits assignment of rights unless otherwise agreed.

## 1031 Exchange Cooperation

### Preferred Position

Secure the broadest possible 1031 exchange cooperation obligation from the seller, while limiting buyer's own exposure:

- Either party may structure the transaction as part of a like-kind exchange under IRC Section 1031, and the other party agrees to cooperate, including executing such documents and taking such actions as may be reasonably necessary to facilitate the exchange.
- The cooperating party shall not be required to (a) incur any additional cost, expense, or liability, (b) extend or accelerate the closing date, or (c) take title to any property other than the Property.
- Buyer may assign this Agreement to a qualified intermediary (QI) or an exchange accommodation titleholder (EAT) without triggering the assignment restrictions, and such assignment shall not require seller consent.
- Seller shall direct its deed, bill of sale, and assignment documents to the QI, EAT, or other exchange entity as directed by Buyer.

All five precedent forms include 1031 cooperation language. The UNICO forms (Buyer Side Section 16.7; Seller Side Section 16.7) and the Seller Income Property form (Section 20) use nearly identical language: each party cooperates, neither incurs additional liability, and the closing date is not affected. This is the market standard.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the 1031 cooperation clause expressly overrides the general assignment restriction. The UNICO forms place the 1031 clause in a separate section from the assignment clause, creating an interpretive question about whether an assignment to a QI requires seller consent. Resolve this ambiguity with a cross-reference: "Notwithstanding Section [Assignment], Buyer may assign its rights hereunder to a qualified intermediary or exchange accommodation titleholder in connection with a 1031 exchange without Seller's consent."
- Include an express hold-harmless: the exchanging party shall indemnify the cooperating party for any costs, expenses, or liabilities incurred solely as a result of the exchange structure.
- Ensure the 1031 clause permits both forward and reverse exchanges. A reverse exchange requires the EAT to take title before the buyer's relinquished property is sold, which may require the seller to convey the Property to an entity other than the buyer. Include language permitting seller to "convey the Property to such party as Buyer shall direct."
- Negotiate for the right to extend the closing date by up to 10 business days if necessary to accommodate the 1031 exchange, notwithstanding the general "no extension" language. Alternatively, build the extension right into the closing mechanics section and cross-reference it here.
- Ensure that the 1031 structure does not excuse performance of any other obligation under the PSA (e.g., the deposit remains at risk, the buyer's representations remain effective).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Mutual cooperation, but cooperating party bears no cost, closing date is not affected, and cooperating party assumes no additional liability. This is the universal market position and is reasonable.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If seller resists an express override of the assignment restriction for 1031 entities, negotiate for a defined term "Permitted 1031 Transferee" (including QIs, EATs, and single-member LLCs formed for exchange purposes) that is expressly excluded from the assignment restriction.
2. If seller resists a closing extension for 1031 purposes, accept this but negotiate for a right to delay the closing by up to 5 business days "for administrative purposes" (without referencing the 1031 exchange) and use this flexibility to coordinate the exchange.
3. If seller insists that buyer's 1031 exchange is entirely buyer's problem, accept the cooperation clause as-is but ensure buyer's QI has authority to sign closing documents on buyer's behalf, minimizing the impact on seller's closing process.
4. If seller will not agree to cooperate at all (rare in institutional deals), include a unilateral right for buyer to assign its rights to a QI at or immediately before closing, treating this as a closing mechanic rather than an assignment.

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk overall**: 1031 cooperation is universal in institutional deals. The primary risk is a poorly drafted clause that creates ambiguity about whether the assignment to a QI requires consent.
- **Moderate risk for reverse exchanges**: Seller may be uncomfortable conveying to an EAT rather than the buyer. Ensure the clause expressly addresses this.
- **High risk if the 1031 exchange delays closing**: If the buyer's relinquished property sale is delayed and the PSA does not permit a closing extension, the buyer may lose the exchange benefit or default on the PSA.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types**: 1031 exchange cooperation is universally applicable. The structure is the same regardless of whether the property is office, industrial, retail, multifamily, or data center.
- **Portfolio deals**: In multi-property transactions, the buyer may exchange into some but not all properties. Ensure the 1031 clause permits partial exchanges and the assignment of rights to specific properties to a QI.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Federal (IRC)**: Section 1031 was amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to exclude personal property from like-kind exchange treatment. Ensure the PSA's allocation of purchase price between real and personal property is consistent with the buyer's 1031 exchange planning.
- **California**: California conforms to federal 1031 treatment but requires "clawback" reporting under Cal. Rev. & Tax Code Section 18032 if the replacement property is outside California. This does not affect PSA drafting but should be flagged for the buyer's tax counsel.
- **All states**: Some states do not conform to federal 1031 treatment (e.g., historically, certain states have proposed decoupling). Buyer's tax counsel should confirm state conformity before relying on the exchange structure.

---

## TIC/DST Structure Accommodations

### Preferred Position

For buyers deploying capital through tenancy-in-common (TIC) or Delaware Statutory Trust (DST) structures, the PSA must expressly accommodate these structures:

- Buyer may assign its rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to one or more tenants in common (TICs) or to a Delaware Statutory Trust (DST), without seller's prior consent, provided an Affiliate of Buyer serves as the managing co-tenant or signatory trustee of the DST.
- The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 16.6) expressly permits partial assignment "to one or more Affiliates of Buyer and/or third parties under a tenancy in common structure, provided an Affiliate of Buyer will be the property manager of the Property under an agreement with all of the tenants in common." This is an excellent model.
- Seller shall cooperate in the execution of separate closing documents for each TIC interest holder or DST, including separate deeds, lease assignments, and contract assignments, at no additional cost to seller (buyer bears the incremental cost of multiple document sets).
- The formation and funding of the TIC or DST shall not delay the closing or modify any obligation under the PSA.

### Key Negotiation Points

- TIC structures are limited to 35 co-tenants under Revenue Procedure 2002-22 for IRS safe-harbor treatment. Ensure the PSA does not inadvertently limit the number of permitted assignees below this threshold.
- DST structures require the trustee to take title and hold the property in trust. The seller must be comfortable conveying to the DST (rather than to an individual or LLC). Include express language permitting the deed to be issued to "[DST Name], a Delaware statutory trust."
- In TIC structures, the title company must issue separate policies or a single policy with multiple named insureds. Coordinate with the title company early and ensure the PSA permits this flexibility.
- Ensure the PSA's representations, conditions precedent, and closing deliverables apply equally to TIC co-tenants and DST structures. For example, if the PSA requires the buyer to deliver an organizational certificate at closing, clarify whether each TIC must deliver one or whether the managing co-tenant's certificate suffices.
- For DST structures, the master lease structure commonly used (where the DST as landlord leases to a master tenant that subleases to operating tenants) must be coordinated with the PSA's lease assignment provisions.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Resistance to TIC/DST structures due to complexity, delay risk, and multiple-counterparty exposure. Sellers may argue that serving multiple TIC co-tenants increases their closing costs and post-closing administrative burden.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If seller resists TIC assignments to non-Affiliates, accept this but ensure the Affiliate definition is broad enough to capture co-investment vehicles managed by the buyer's platform (see Definition of Affiliate section above).
2. If seller objects to closing complexity, offer to bear all incremental costs of multiple document sets, including seller's legal fees for reviewing additional closing documents, and to coordinate all TIC/DST documentation through buyer's counsel.
3. If seller resists DST structures specifically, negotiate for a right to assign post-closing (i.e., buyer takes title at closing through a single SPE and subsequently contributes the property to a DST). Ensure the PSA does not contain any post-closing transfer restrictions that would prevent this.
4. If seller insists on a single grantee, accept this but ensure the PSA expressly permits buyer to form a DST or TIC post-closing and to transfer the property into the DST/TIC structure without seller's consent or involvement.

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk if TIC/DST structures are not addressed**: Buyer may be unable to deploy investor capital through the intended structure, causing a potential default or requiring a post-closing restructuring that may trigger transfer taxes or reassessments.
- **Moderate risk from closing complexity**: Multiple TIC co-tenants increase the document volume and error risk at closing. Mitigate through detailed closing checklists and pre-closing document review.
- **Low risk if the PSA expressly permits post-closing restructuring**: Even if the seller will not accommodate a TIC/DST at closing, post-closing structuring is within the buyer's control.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily**: DST structures are extremely common in multifamily acquisitions due to the 1031 exchange market (multifamily is the most popular replacement property type for DST investors). Ensure the PSA accommodates this.
- **Industrial/logistics**: TIC structures are increasingly popular for large industrial assets where multiple investors co-invest. Single-tenant, NNN-leased industrial properties are particularly well-suited for DST structuring.
- **Office**: TIC and DST structures are less common for office (given higher management intensity) but still used for stabilized, long-term-leased office assets.
- **Retail**: Net-leased retail (single-tenant) is a prime DST candidate. Multi-tenant retail is less suitable due to management complexity that conflicts with DST passive-investment requirements.
- **Data centers**: Specialized asset class where TIC/DST is unusual but not impossible. The operational complexity of data centers generally makes them less suitable for passive DST structures.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Delaware**: DSTs are formed under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, 12 Del. C. Section 3801 et seq. The DST trust agreement must comply with the Act's requirements, including the appointment of a Delaware trustee. Ensure the PSA does not require the buyer/grantee to be organized in any specific jurisdiction.
- **Federal (IRS)**: Revenue Ruling 2004-86 provides the IRS framework for treating DST interests as direct interests in real property for 1031 purposes. The DST must be structured as a fixed investment trust under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4, which limits the trustee's powers. Coordinate with buyer's tax counsel.
- **California**: California recognizes DSTs but imposes franchise tax on trusts doing business in California. Factor this into the economic analysis.
- **New York**: NYC RPTT and NYS transfer tax may apply to contributions to a DST if the DST holds NYC real property. Structure the DST contribution as a simultaneous close to avoid a separate taxable transfer.

## Restrictions on Change of Control of Buyer Entity

### Preferred Position

Resist any restriction on changes in the direct or indirect ownership of the Buyer entity. The preferred position is:

- Changes in the direct or indirect ownership or control of Buyer shall not be deemed an assignment of this Agreement and shall not require Seller's consent.
- This includes, without limitation, (a) the admission or withdrawal of partners, members, or shareholders, (b) transfers of direct or indirect interests in Buyer, (c) changes in the management or governance structure of Buyer, and (d) any merger, consolidation, or reorganization of Buyer or any direct or indirect owner of Buyer.

### Key Negotiation Points

- None of the reviewed precedent forms contain explicit change-of-control restrictions. However, the Detailed Seller PSA's reference to "the owners of Purchaser as of the Effective Date" in the Affiliate assignment provision (Section 11.3(a)) implies that a change in ownership of the buyer could affect the buyer's ability to make consent-free Affiliate assignments. Ensure this linkage is severed.
- The Meadows form's broad prohibition on assignment "or transfer" of "this Agreement, or any interest in or part of this Agreement" (Section 9.11) could arguably be construed to cover an indirect transfer of the buyer's interest in the PSA via a change of control. Include express language confirming that changes in indirect ownership do not constitute transfers of the Agreement.
- If the seller insists on some change-of-control protection, negotiate for a "Key Person" concept: the PSA restricts changes in control only if a specified individual (the buyer's principal or deal lead) ceases to be involved in the transaction. This is narrower than a full change-of-control provision and addresses the seller's legitimate concern about counterparty identity.
- Ensure that the anti-change-of-control provision (if accepted) does not apply to changes occurring above the buyer entity level (e.g., a corporate reorganization of the buyer's parent or a change in the GP of the buyer's fund).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Silence on change of control (most common), or a broad prohibition on any transfer of "any interest" in the Agreement, which may be construed to include indirect transfers.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If seller insists on a change-of-control restriction, define "change of control" narrowly: a transfer of more than 50% of the direct ownership interests in Buyer to a person or entity that is not an Affiliate of Buyer as of the Effective Date.
2. If seller insists on a lower threshold (e.g., 25%), accept this but exclude from the definition (a) transfers among existing owners, (b) transfers to Affiliates, (c) transfers required by the organizational documents of Buyer or its parent entities, and (d) transfers resulting from the death, disability, or retirement of a principal.
3. If seller insists on consent for any change of control, negotiate for a "not unreasonably withheld" standard rather than sole discretion.
4. As a final fallback, accept the change-of-control restriction but limit its duration to the period before closing only. Post-closing ownership changes should not be restricted by the PSA (they may be restricted by loan documents, but that is a separate matter).

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk if broadly drafted change-of-control restrictions apply**: In fund transactions, investor redemptions, capital calls, and secondary market transfers of fund interests occur routinely. A broad change-of-control provision could inadvertently trigger a consent requirement or default.
- **Moderate risk if the change-of-control provision is linked to the Affiliate definition**: If the Affiliate definition depends on specific ownership percentages "as of the Effective Date" and those percentages change, the buyer may lose its consent-free assignment rights.
- **Low risk if change-of-control provisions are absent**: The buyer has full flexibility to restructure above the PSA signatory level.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types**: Change-of-control risk is primarily a function of the buyer's organizational structure rather than the asset type. However, in sale-leaseback transactions (common in industrial and office), the seller-tenant may separately restrict changes in control of the buyer-landlord through the lease.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Delaware**: Delaware LLC Act Section 18-702 governs the assignment of LLC interests and distinguishes between assignment of economic rights (which is generally permitted) and assignment of governance rights (which requires consent unless the operating agreement provides otherwise). A change of control at the member level may or may not constitute an "assignment" depending on the operating agreement.
- **New York**: New York courts have held that a transfer of a controlling interest in an entity that holds a contract can constitute an "assignment" of the contract under certain circumstances. Include express language in the PSA negating this implication.

## Delaware Statutory Trust Considerations

### Preferred Position

Where the buyer intends to acquire through a DST (either at closing or post-closing), the PSA should include express accommodations:

- The DST is a permitted assignee under the PSA without seller consent.
- Seller shall convey the Property by deed to the DST as directed by Buyer.
- The DST's signatory trustee (typically an Affiliate of the buyer's sponsor) is authorized to execute all closing documents on behalf of the DST.
- The PSA's representations, covenants, and conditions precedent apply to the signatory trustee and the DST, and the seller is not required to obtain representations or deliverables from individual DST beneficial owners.
- Any master-lease structure employed by the DST (where the DST as fee owner leases to a master tenant, typically an Affiliate of the sponsor, which subleases to the operating tenants) shall not constitute a violation of any covenant in the PSA prohibiting new leases or encumbrances prior to closing, provided the master lease is entered into simultaneously with closing.

### Key Negotiation Points

- DSTs are passive investment vehicles. Under IRS Revenue Ruling 2004-86, the trustee's powers are strictly limited -- the trustee cannot renegotiate leases, make capital improvements beyond those required by existing leases, or enter into new leases (other than renewals per existing terms). This passivity requirement may create tension with the PSA's interim operating covenants if the buyer takes title as a DST at closing. Ensure the PSA's operating covenants terminate at closing and do not bind the DST post-closing.
- The typical DST capital structure involves a senior loan secured by the property and DST beneficial interests sold to 1031 exchange investors. Lenders may require the DST to be the borrower, which means the loan closing and the PSA closing must be coordinated. Ensure the PSA permits simultaneous loan closing by the DST.
- DST formation, SEC/state securities compliance, and investor closings are time-intensive. Negotiate for a closing extension right of 30-60 days if the buyer elects a DST structure, or build sufficient time into the base closing date.
- Ensure the PSA's deposit and default provisions run against the buyer's sponsor entity (not the DST itself), as the DST may not be funded until closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Unfamiliarity with DST structures; concern about closing delay, complexity, and counterparty creditworthiness. Seller may insist that the DST is "just another buyer" and should not receive special accommodations.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If seller resists DST-specific accommodations, include a general "designee" right (Buyer may designate the grantee at closing) and structure the DST formation and closing mechanics outside the PSA.
2. If seller objects to conveying to a DST, offer to have the buyer's SPE take title at closing and immediately contribute the property to the DST post-closing. Ensure the PSA does not restrict post-closing transfers.
3. If seller insists on a closing extension premium for DST delays, negotiate for a per-diem extension fee (e.g., $[amount] per day) rather than a flat fee, capped at the extension period.
4. If seller will not accommodate the DST at all, proceed with a standard SPE acquisition and complete the DST structuring post-closing, ensuring no transfer tax, title insurance, or lender-consent issues arise from the post-closing contribution.

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk if DST closing is not coordinated**: DST investor closings, loan closings, and PSA closings must all occur simultaneously. Any misalignment can delay or derail the transaction.
- **Moderate risk if the PSA does not expressly address DST**: The buyer can often work around PSA silence by using a designee or post-closing contribution, but this adds cost and complexity.
- **Low risk if DST is expressly permitted**: With clear PSA language, the closing mechanics are straightforward.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily and NNN industrial/retail**: The most common DST property types due to stable cash flows, long-term leases, and limited management requirements. PSA accommodations for DST are routine in these asset classes.
- **Office**: Less common for DST due to management intensity, but stabilized, long-term-leased office assets (e.g., single-tenant government or credit-tenant office) are suitable.
- **Data centers**: Rarely structured as DSTs due to operational complexity and the DST passivity requirement. If a data center DST is contemplated, ensure the master-lease structure adequately insulates the DST from operational decisions.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Delaware**: DSTs are governed by 12 Del. C. Section 3801 et seq. The trust agreement must appoint a Delaware trustee. Formation costs are modest, but ongoing franchise tax applies.
- **Federal (SEC)**: DST beneficial interests are securities under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933. The offering must be registered or exempt (typically under Regulation D, Rule 506(b) or 506(c)). This does not directly affect the PSA but affects the buyer's timeline for closing.
- **State securities**: Each state has its own securities registration or exemption requirements for DST offerings. This may affect the buyer's investor base and closing timeline but does not directly affect PSA drafting.

## Prohibited Assignment Consequences

### Preferred Position

Ensure that the consequences of a prohibited assignment are proportionate and do not give the seller a windfall:

- A purported assignment in violation of the assignment restrictions shall be voidable at the election of the non-assigning party (not automatically void).
- A prohibited assignment shall not constitute a default unless the assigning party fails to cure within 10 business days of written notice from the non-assigning party.
- If a prohibited assignment constitutes a default, the non-assigning party's remedy is limited to specific performance (requiring reversal of the assignment) or the standard default remedy under the PSA -- not an independent liquidated damages or forfeiture right.
- The buyer should resist any provision that makes a prohibited assignment an automatic termination event or an automatic forfeiture of the deposit.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3) states that any attempted assignment in violation of the restriction "shall, at the election of Seller, be of no force or effect and shall constitute a default by Purchaser." This is the seller-favorable standard: the assignment is voidable at seller's election and simultaneously constitutes a buyer default. Negotiate to decouple these consequences -- the assignment should be void, but the default should require notice and an opportunity to cure (reverse the assignment).
- The Meadows form does not specify consequences of a prohibited assignment beyond the general requirement of seller consent. In this vacuum, the common law remedy is that the assignment is voidable but the underlying contract remains enforceable. Ensure the PSA does not create harsher consequences than the common law default.
- Resist any provision that accelerates the closing date or forfeits the deposit upon a prohibited assignment. Assignment violations are often technical (e.g., the notice period was 4 days instead of 5) and should not result in deal termination or forfeiture.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: Prohibited assignment is a default; seller may terminate and retain the deposit.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If seller insists that a prohibited assignment constitutes a default, accept this but negotiate for a cure period (10 business days) during which the buyer can reverse the assignment or obtain retroactive consent.
2. If seller insists on an immediate termination right, negotiate for a grace period before termination takes effect (e.g., seller may terminate if the prohibited assignment is not reversed within 15 business days of notice).
3. If seller insists on deposit forfeiture, limit the forfeiture to the amount of the initial deposit (not the hard deposit or any additional deposits) and characterize it as liquidated damages (not as a penalty).
4. As a final fallback, accept the seller's position but ensure the assignment restrictions are clear and unambiguous, with bright-line tests, to minimize the risk of an inadvertent violation.

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk if deposit forfeiture is automatic upon prohibited assignment**: Technical violations (late notice, incorrect entity name in the notice) could trigger catastrophic consequences.
- **Moderate risk if the assignment is automatically void**: An automatically void assignment could leave the buyer without a grantee at closing, causing a closing failure.
- **Low risk if notice and cure are provided**: A cure period allows the buyer to correct assignment defects without jeopardizing the transaction.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types**: Prohibited assignment consequences are generally asset-type agnostic. The risk is contractual, not property-specific.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions**: Most U.S. courts distinguish between "void" assignments (which have no legal effect ab initio) and "voidable" assignments (which are effective until set aside by the aggrieved party). "Voidable at the election of Seller" is the preferred formulation because it preserves the seller's ability to ratify the assignment if it is acceptable.
- **California**: California Civil Code Section 1670.5 permits courts to refuse to enforce unconscionable contract provisions. A provision that forfeits the entire deposit upon a technical assignment violation may be subject to challenge as unconscionable, depending on the circumstances.
- **New York**: New York courts generally enforce liquidated damages provisions if the amount is reasonable in light of anticipated or actual harm. A deposit forfeiture provision triggered by a prohibited assignment will be upheld if the deposit amount is reasonable.

## Timing of Assignment Notice

### Preferred Position

Negotiate for the shortest practicable notice period for assignment, with flexibility to provide notice up to and including the closing date:

- Notice of assignment to an Affiliate or permitted assignee shall be given at least 2 business days before closing. This is the UNICO standard (both Buyer and Seller Side forms, Section 16.6).
- The notice shall include the full legal name of the assignee, its state of organization, its principal office address, and its signature block (as required by the UNICO forms).
- If buyer fails to provide timely notice, the assignment shall not be void; rather, seller shall have the right to delay closing by up to 5 business days to review the assignment and update closing documents.
- Buyer should retain the right to designate the grantee (as distinct from assigning the PSA) at any time up to and including the closing date, by providing wire instructions and grantee information to the title company and seller.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The UNICO forms require 2 business days' notice -- this is the most buyer-favorable standard in the reviewed precedents. The Detailed Seller PSA requires 5 days' notice (Section 11.3(f)). Seller-drafted forms will push for 10-15 business days.
- The critical distinction is between "assignment notice" (which triggers a review period and potential consent process) and "grantee designation" (which is a closing mechanic that merely tells the title company and seller where to direct the deed). Push for the grantee designation concept as a supplement to or replacement for the formal assignment notice.
- Ensure the notice period does not create a trap: if the buyer identifies the assignee 3 days before closing but the PSA requires 5 days' notice, the buyer must either delay closing or risk a prohibited assignment. Negotiate for a cure mechanism: if notice is late, seller may delay closing by the number of days the notice was late, but the assignment is not void.
- In portfolio transactions with staggered closings, ensure the notice period runs separately for each property closing, not once for the entire portfolio.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller's likely position**: 5-10 business days' notice, with the notice period running before the closing date (i.e., if closing is Day 30, notice must be given by Day 20-25).

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If seller insists on 5 business days, accept this but define the trigger as "5 business days before the scheduled Closing Date" (not 5 business days before the actual closing date, which may be different due to extensions).
2. If seller insists on 10 business days, accept this but negotiate for a separate "grantee designation" right that permits the buyer to name the grantee on the deed up to 2 business days before closing without triggering the formal assignment notice requirement.
3. If seller insists that late notice voids the assignment, negotiate for a cure period: late notice does not void the assignment if the buyer provides the notice within 2 business days after the deadline, but seller may delay closing by up to 5 business days.
4. As a final fallback, accept the seller's notice period but plan the entity formation and assignment timeline to accommodate it, and build a buffer into the closing date.

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk if late notice triggers automatic voiding**: Last-minute entity formation is common in institutional deals, and rigid notice deadlines can void a legitimate assignment.
- **Moderate risk with a 5-business-day notice period**: This is generally workable if the buyer plans ahead, but leaves little margin for error.
- **Low risk with 2 business days**: Provides sufficient flexibility for most institutional structures while giving the seller enough time to update closing documents.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types**: Assignment notice timing is generally asset-type agnostic. The key variable is the complexity of the buyer's entity structure and the number of closing documents that must be updated to reflect the assignee.
- **Portfolio deals**: In multi-property closings, different properties may be assigned to different entities. Allow for property-specific notices.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions**: Notice provisions are universally enforced as written. There is no implied grace period for late assignment notices in any jurisdiction. Contractual protections are essential.
- **States with recording requirements**: In jurisdictions where the deed must name the grantee and any discrepancy between the PSA buyer and the grantee on the deed creates title issues (most jurisdictions), timely assignment notice is critical to ensure the deed is correctly prepared. Coordinate with the title company on document preparation timelines.

---

## Cross-Referencing Notes

- **Closing Mechanics (Section 9)**: Ensure the closing deliverables section requires updated signature blocks and entity documentation for any assignee, and that the title company is authorized to accept closing documents from the assignee.
- **Representations and Warranties (Section 5)**: Ensure buyer's representations (organizational authority, ERISA, AML) run to the assignee as well as the original buyer. The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3(c)) requires the assignee to make ERISA and AML representations -- this should be standard.
- **Default and Remedies (Section 12)**: Ensure the default provisions cross-reference the assignment restrictions and that prohibited assignment consequences are consistent between the two sections.
- **Definitions (Section 1)**: The Affiliate definition should be in the definitions section and cross-referenced in the assignment clause.
- **Conditions Precedent (Section 7)**: If seller consent to assignment is a condition precedent to closing, ensure the condition is for seller's benefit only and can be waived by seller.
