# Section 10: Prorations and Adjustments -- Buyer Playbook

> **Orientation:** This playbook addresses every proration and adjustment concept a buyer's counsel must negotiate in an institutional commercial real estate acquisition. The buyer's overriding objectives are: (1) ensure the purchase price accurately reflects the economic reality of the property as of closing, (2) shift as much pre-closing expense exposure to the seller as possible, (3) secure robust post-closing reconciliation rights with audit protections, and (4) protect against latent liabilities (reassessment, delinquent rents, unfunded TI/LC obligations) that surface after closing.

## 1. Proration Methodology and Day-of-Closing Allocation

### Preferred Position
The day of closing should be allocated to the **buyer** (i.e., the buyer is deemed to own the property and be entitled to income and responsible for expenses for the entire day of closing). The proration cutoff should be 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the closing date. All prorations should be calculated on an actual-days-elapsed / actual-days-in-month / 365-day-year basis. The preliminary proration schedule should be delivered by the seller at least 5 business days before closing, with the parties using good-faith efforts to agree on the final closing statement at least 2 business days before closing.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 11.7.1-11.7.2) establishes this as the standard: "Buyer shall be deemed to hold title to the Property and be entitled to the income therefrom and responsible for the expenses thereof for the entire day upon which the Closing occurs." The Meadows form (Section 8.4) similarly uses the "end of day immediately preceding the Closing Date" cutoff. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4) uses "12:01 a.m. on the date on which the Closing occurs," which achieves the same result but from a different directional framing.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Cutoff time specificity:** Insist on a stated time (11:59 p.m. local time the day before closing) rather than ambiguous language like "as of closing." The UNICO forms explicitly use "11:59 pm [LOCAL TIME] on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date."
- **Actual-day calculation:** Reject 30/360 or other simplified calculation methods. Require actual days elapsed in the actual month and a 365-day year. All source forms agree on this methodology.
- **Draft proration schedule timing:** Require the seller to deliver a draft proration schedule with supporting documentation at least 5 business days before closing (per UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.8). This gives the buyer's accountants time to verify.
- **Closing Date extension for proration disputes:** Include the right to extend closing by 2 business days if the parties cannot agree on the closing statement despite good-faith efforts (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.8).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller wants day of closing:** Some seller forms allocate the day of closing to the seller. This is a relatively minor economic point on most items but can be significant on high-rent-per-day properties. **Fallback:** Accept seller-gets-the-day only if offset by concessions elsewhere, or if closing is scheduled for the first of the month (minimizing the impact).
- **Seller resists pre-closing proration schedule:** Seller may argue it is burdensome to prepare 5 days in advance. **Fallback:** Accept 3 business days, but never agree to prorations being calculated solely at closing without buyer review.
- **Seller wants 30/360 methodology:** This is outdated and can create inaccuracies in short months (February) and for mid-month closings. **Fallback:** If seller insists, require a true-up to actual days within 60 days post-closing.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** if standard 11:59 p.m. / actual-day methodology is used. The economic difference between buyer-gets-the-day and seller-gets-the-day is typically one day's NOI, which on a $100M asset at a 6% cap rate is approximately $16,400.
- **Medium risk** if the methodology is ambiguous. Ambiguity invites disputes, particularly on properties with irregular income streams.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office/Industrial:** Standard methodology works well. Rents are typically monthly in arrears.
- **Retail:** Percentage rent complications may require year-end reconciliation separate from the base rent proration.
- **Multifamily:** High tenant turnover means more granular daily proration may be needed for move-in/move-out adjustments. Consider whether the proration captures utility reimbursements under RUBS (Ratio Utility Billing Systems).
- **Data Center:** Power cost prorations can be extremely significant. Ensure metered utility pass-throughs are captured in the proration methodology, not just base rent.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** The NY Checklist does not specifically address proration methodology, but NY custom is typically a "day before" cutoff. Transfer tax calculations in NYC are separate from prorations.
- **California:** Fiscal-year tax proration (July 1-June 30) creates complexity. Ensure the methodology accounts for the fiscal year, not the calendar year.
- **Illinois:** Cook County reassessment triennial cycles must be considered when establishing the tax proration basis.
- **Oregon:** The Meadows form (Oregon property) uses the same standard methodology, confirming West Coast consistency.

## 2. Real Property Tax Prorations

### Preferred Position
Real property taxes should be prorated based on the **current year's actual tax bill** whenever available. If the current bill is not yet available at closing, proration should be based on the most recent assessed valuation with the current tax rate applied, subject to mandatory reproration when the actual bill is issued. The seller should bear all taxes attributable to its period of ownership regardless of when such taxes become due and payable. The buyer should be protected from any reassessment or supplemental tax triggered by the sale itself.

**Cross-reference:** The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(c)) bases prorations on "actual current bills" but provides for initial proration using "100% of the tax rate for the period covered by the most current available tax bill to the latest assessed valuation" if the current bill is unavailable. Critically, this seller-side form includes the carve-out: "in no event shall Seller be charged with or responsible for any increase in real estate taxes resulting from the sale of the Property to Purchaser or from any improvements made or Leases entered into on or after the Closing." The buyer must resist this provision.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Current-year vs. prior-year basis:** Always insist on current-year actual taxes. If unavailable, use the most recent assessed value multiplied by the current mill rate, with a post-closing true-up. The Seller Income Property form (Section on Prorations) allows prior-year basis if the current rate is not yet fixed, but mandates reproration "upon receipt of written evidence of the payment thereof."
- **Reassessment risk allocation:** This is the single most contentious tax proration issue. The seller will argue that any reassessment triggered by the change of ownership should be the buyer's responsibility. The buyer should argue that the seller's period of ownership should be prorated based on what the taxes actually are (or will be), not on an artificially low pre-sale assessment.
  - **Preferred:** Seller bears taxes at the reassessed value for its period of ownership in the year of closing.
  - **First fallback:** Seller bears taxes based on the pre-sale assessment for its period, but the buyer receives a credit at closing equal to the estimated increase from reassessment for the seller's portion of the year.
  - **Second fallback:** Accept a proration based on the pre-sale assessment with no reassessment adjustment, but only if the purchase price was negotiated with this understanding.
- **Supplemental taxes:** In states like California (Proposition 13 supplemental tax regime), a change of ownership triggers supplemental tax bills. Insist that supplemental taxes attributable to the seller's period of ownership are the seller's responsibility. This should be an express surviving obligation.
- **Tax appeals and refunds:** The buyer should control all tax appeal proceedings for the year of closing and all subsequent years. For the year of closing, any refund should be allocated between the parties based on their respective periods of ownership, after deducting the costs of obtaining the refund and any amounts owed to tenants under their leases. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(c)) provides: "Any refunds of real estate taxes made after the Closing shall first be applied to the unreimbursed third-party costs incurred by Seller or Purchaser in obtaining the refund, then paid to any Tenants who are entitled to the same and the balance, if any, shall be paid to Seller (for the period prior to the Closing Date) and to Purchaser (for the period commencing on and after the Closing Date)."
- **Tax protest escrow:** If there is a pending tax protest at closing, require an escrow holdback equal to the potential refund attributable to the seller's period, ensuring the buyer is not left holding the bag if the protest succeeds after the seller has dissolved.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller insists on prior-year proration with no true-up:** This is common in seller-favorable forms. **Fallback:** Accept prior-year basis but require a 120-day post-closing true-up window with express surviving obligations.
- **Seller demands buyer bear all reassessment risk:** The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(c)) expressly provides that seller is not charged for tax increases "resulting from the sale of the Property to Purchaser." **Resist aggressively.** Fallback: Accept this only for the buyer's period of ownership in the year of closing, not for the seller's period.
- **Seller wants to retain control of pending tax appeals:** **Fallback:** Seller may retain control of appeals for pre-closing tax years, but the buyer should have consultation rights and the right to approve any settlement that could establish precedent for future years.
- **Seller resists tax protest escrow:** **Fallback:** Accept a survival period of 12 months for tax proration obligations as an alternative to an escrow, but ensure the seller entity will not dissolve within that period.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk** in jurisdictions with frequent reassessment on transfer (California, Illinois, many others). On a $75M office building assessed at $50M, a reassessment to $75M could increase annual taxes by $500,000+ depending on the mill rate.
- **Medium risk** where taxes are relatively stable and tenant pass-throughs cover the exposure.
- **Critical:** Always review whether the property is in a TIF (Tax Increment Financing) district, which can create complex proration issues.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office:** Tenant pass-through provisions may offset some risk, but base-year stops mean the landlord absorbs increases up to the base year. A reassessment in the year of closing can reset the base year under some lease forms.
- **Industrial:** Triple-net leases often pass through 100% of taxes, reducing the buyer's exposure but requiring careful proration of tenant reimbursements.
- **Retail:** Percentage-of-occupancy-cost provisions in some retail leases cap tenant exposure, leaving the landlord with residual risk from tax increases.
- **Multifamily:** No tenant pass-throughs. The full reassessment risk falls on the buyer. This makes the reassessment protection argument even more critical.
- **Data Center:** High-value improvements can lead to significant tax assessments. Some jurisdictions offer data center tax incentives or abatements that must be verified as transferable to the buyer.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **California:** Proposition 13 reassessment on change of ownership is virtually certain. Supplemental tax bills will be issued. Base-year value resets to purchase price. Insist on seller responsibility for supplemental taxes attributable to the seller's period.
- **New York:** NYC has different assessment ratios for different property classes. Transitional assessments can create multi-year complications.
- **Illinois:** Cook County triennial reassessment cycle. If the property is due for reassessment, the buyer faces significant uncertainty. Consider requiring the seller to fund an escrow for the estimated increase.
- **Texas:** No state income tax, but high property taxes. Annual revaluation to market value. Buyer should verify the protest cycle and pending protests.
- **Oregon:** Measure 50 limits assessed value increases to 3% per year, but "exception value" for new construction or improvements can create jumps. The Meadows form does not address reassessment risk.
- **Colorado/Massachusetts:** The Detailed Seller Side form is drafted for Colorado/Massachusetts jurisdictions and includes the strongest seller protections on reassessment (Section 8.4(c)-(d)).

## 3. Rent Prorations (Current Month)

### Preferred Position
Rent for the month of closing should be prorated based on actual days in the month, with the buyer receiving a credit for any rent collected by the seller that is attributable to the buyer's period of ownership from and after the closing date. All prepaid rents should be credited to the buyer. The proration should include base rent, additional rent, percentage rent (if determinable), parking revenue, storage revenue, antenna/telecom rents, and any other income derived from the property.

**Cross-reference:** The Meadows form (Section 8.4(b)) provides: "Buyer shall receive a credit for any rent and other income (and any applicable state or local tax on rent), including operating expenses and other pass-through expenses, under the Leases collected by Seller before the Closing that apply to any period after the Closing." The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 11.7.1) includes "all rentals and other income derived from the Property (including operating costs and other tenant reimbursements)." The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(b)) adds specificity for parking leases with a retroactive reproration mechanism.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Comprehensive income capture:** The rent proration must capture all income streams, not just base rent. Ensure the definition includes CAM reimbursements, tax reimbursements, insurance reimbursements, percentage rent, parking revenue, storage revenue, antenna/rooftop license fees, signage income, and any other income.
- **State/local rent tax:** In jurisdictions that impose taxes on rent (e.g., certain Arizona municipalities), ensure the proration includes applicable rent taxes. The Meadows form expressly includes "any applicable state or local tax on rent."
- **Prepaid rent credit:** Any rent collected by the seller for periods after closing must be credited to the buyer at closing, not merely remitted post-closing.
- **Parking lease reproration:** The Detailed Seller Side form provides a useful mechanism for parking leases where the actual month's rent may not be known at closing: prorate initially based on the prior month's actual rent, then reprorate retroactively when the current month's rent becomes determinable.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller wants to limit proration to "collected" rent only:** This is actually favorable to the buyer for current-month rent (it means only rent the seller has actually received is prorated, avoiding a credit to the seller for rent not yet collected). Accept this formulation for current-month rent but ensure it does not limit the buyer's right to retain future collections.
- **Seller excludes certain income streams:** **Resist.** All income from the property should be prorated. If the seller argues that antenna income or parking income is under a separate agreement, insist those agreements are assigned and the income prorated.
- **Seller wants gross-up for vacant space:** Some sellers try to prorate as if all space were leased ("economic prorations"). **Reject this entirely.** Prorations should be based on actual income, not theoretical income.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** for current-month rent proration if the language is clear and comprehensive. The economic impact is typically one month's rent allocation.
- **Medium risk** if income streams are poorly defined or if there are irregular payment schedules (e.g., quarterly rent payments, annual percentage rent).

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office:** Monthly rent in advance is standard. Proration is straightforward.
- **Industrial:** Some industrial leases have quarterly or semi-annual rent payments. Ensure the proration captures these less-frequent payment schedules.
- **Retail:** Percentage rent is a major complication. See Section 4 below for detailed treatment.
- **Multifamily:** High volume of individual leases. Consider whether the proration methodology can handle hundreds of individual prorations or whether a summary-level approach is needed.
- **Data Center:** Power revenue and interconnection fees can exceed base rent. Ensure these are captured in the income proration.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Arizona:** Certain municipalities impose a Transaction Privilege Tax on rental income. Ensure the proration addresses this.
- **New York:** NYC commercial rent tax (for certain Manhattan tenants) is the tenant's obligation but must be tracked for accurate proration of any landlord pass-through obligations.
- **Florida:** No state income tax but sales tax on commercial rent (currently 5.5% state + local surtax). This must be prorated.

---

## 4. Percentage Rent

### Preferred Position
Percentage rent for the year of closing should be prorated based on the seller's and buyer's respective periods of ownership. The seller should provide the buyer with all tenant sales reports and percentage rent calculations through the closing date. For the year of closing, the breakpoint should be applied to the full year's sales, and the percentage rent above the breakpoint should be allocated based on each party's period of ownership as a proportion of the full lease year. The buyer should have the right to audit tenant sales for the seller's period and to pursue any deficiencies.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Breakpoint allocation:** The natural breakpoint for the full lease year should not be split between the parties. Instead, the full-year breakpoint should be applied to the full-year sales, and only the overage above the breakpoint should be prorated by period of ownership.
- **Reporting timeline:** Percentage rent is typically calculated annually, well after closing. Require the seller to provide all available sales data through closing, and establish that the post-closing reconciliation mechanism covers percentage rent.
- **Tenant audit rights:** Ensure the buyer succeeds to the landlord's audit rights for the seller's period of ownership in the year of closing.
- **Natural vs. artificial breakpoints:** If the lease uses a "natural" breakpoint (base rent / percentage rate), the methodology is straightforward. If the lease uses an artificial breakpoint, ensure the proration formula accounts for this.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller wants percentage rent excluded from prorations:** This is common in seller-side forms. **Resist.** If the seller insists, require an express surviving obligation for the seller to cooperate with the buyer's percentage rent calculation and to pay its proportionate share.
- **Seller wants the breakpoint split:** Some sellers argue the breakpoint should be split by period of ownership (i.e., the seller's breakpoint is the annual breakpoint x seller's fraction of the year). This is economically disadvantageous to the buyer because it lowers the effective breakpoint for the seller's period. **Resist.** The full-year breakpoint should apply to full-year sales.
- **Fallback:** If the seller will not agree to prorate percentage rent, negotiate for the buyer to retain 100% of percentage rent for the year of closing (since the buyer bears the administrative burden of collection) in exchange for a reduction in the purchase price.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium-to-high risk** in retail-heavy properties where percentage rent is a meaningful component of NOI.
- **Low risk** in office, industrial, and multifamily where percentage rent is rare or nonexistent.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Retail:** This is the primary asset type where percentage rent matters. Grocery-anchored centers, lifestyle centers, and regional malls all have significant percentage rent exposure.
- **Office/Industrial/Multifamily/Data Center:** Percentage rent is typically not applicable. Some office leases for co-working operators may have revenue-sharing provisions that function similarly.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant jurisdictional variation. Percentage rent proration is governed by the lease terms and the PSA, not by statute.

---

## 5. Delinquent Rent Collection and Allocation

### Preferred Position
Delinquent rent (rent due but uncollected as of closing) should **not** be prorated at closing. The buyer should not be required to give the seller a credit for uncollected rent. After closing, all payments received from a delinquent tenant should be applied in the following order: (1) first, to amounts owed for the current month at the time of receipt; (2) second, to amounts owed to the buyer for its period of ownership; (3) third, to amounts owed to the seller for its period of ownership. The buyer should have an obligation to bill delinquent tenants in the ordinary course for a reasonable period (6 months) but should not be required to litigate, hire collection agencies, or declare defaults. The seller should retain the right to pursue collection against delinquent tenants independently, provided the seller may not terminate any lease or seek eviction.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 11.7.1 / 7.5) establishes the buyer-favorable waterfall: "(a) first toward the delinquent rent for the actual month in which Closing occurred, (b) second toward the delinquent rent owed to Buyer for its period of ownership and (c) third toward the delinquent rent owed to Seller for its period of ownership." The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(f)) uses a different, more seller-favorable waterfall: current month first, then next month (buyer), then prior month (seller), then subsequent months (buyer), then remaining pre-closing months (seller).

### Key Negotiation Points
- **No credit at closing for delinquencies:** This is the most critical point. The buyer should never give the seller credit for rent the seller failed to collect. The Meadows form (Section 8.4(b)) clearly states: "Uncollected rent and other uncollected income shall not be prorated at the Closing."
- **Waterfall priority:** The buyer's preferred waterfall (current month, then buyer's period, then seller's period) ensures the buyer's operations are funded before the seller receives any delinquent amounts. The Detailed Seller Side form's more granular waterfall (which inserts "the month immediately following the month in which the Closing occurs" as second priority and "the month immediately before the month in which the Closing occurs" as third) is designed to benefit the seller by giving near-closing months priority over the buyer's later months. **Resist this.**
- **Buyer's collection obligations:** The buyer should have a limited, good-faith obligation to bill delinquent tenants in the ordinary course. The UNICO Buyer Side form limits this to billing and attempting to collect "in the ordinary course of business" without obligation to "engage a collection agency or take legal action." The Meadows form similarly limits this. Insist on a time limit (6 months) after which the buyer has no further obligation.
- **Seller's independent collection rights:** Allow the seller to pursue delinquent tenants directly, but with the critical restriction that the seller may not terminate any lease, seek eviction, or otherwise disturb the tenant's occupancy.
- **Prohibition on buyer waiving delinquencies:** The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(b)) includes: "Purchaser shall not waive any Delinquent Rent or modify or amend any Lease so as to reduce the Delinquent Rent owed by the Tenant for any period in which Seller is entitled to receive such Delinquent Rent, without first obtaining Seller's written consent." This is reasonable and the buyer should accept this provision.
- **Collection cost deduction:** Any amounts remitted to the seller should be net of the buyer's reasonable third-party collection costs.
- **Tenant-designated payments:** If a tenant designates its payment as being for a specific period, that designation should control the allocation. The Meadows form provides for this: "unless such Tenant properly identifies the payment as being for a specific item."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller wants credit at closing for delinquencies:** **Reject.** This shifts collection risk to the buyer.
- **Seller wants a more favorable waterfall (seller's period before buyer's future months):** **Fallback:** Accept the Detailed Seller Side waterfall (which gives the month immediately before closing priority over the buyer's future months) only if the buyer's current month and next month are protected first.
- **Seller wants buyer to litigate for collection:** **Reject.** The buyer should never be required to incur legal costs to collect the seller's delinquent rent. **Fallback:** Agree that the buyer will cooperate with the seller's collection efforts (signing consents, providing information) at the seller's expense.
- **Seller wants unlimited collection pursuit period:** **Fallback:** Accept seller's right to pursue collection for 12 months post-closing, after which the right terminates.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk** if the property has significant delinquencies at closing. Due diligence should identify all delinquencies. If delinquencies exceed 5% of annual gross rent, consider a purchase price adjustment rather than relying on post-closing collection mechanics.
- **Medium risk** on standard institutional properties with creditworthy tenants.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office:** Delinquencies are typically low on institutional office properties. The primary risk is a major tenant in financial distress.
- **Industrial:** Similar to office. Single-tenant risk may be higher.
- **Retail:** Higher delinquency risk, particularly in properties with local/regional tenants. Post-COVID, retail delinquencies remain elevated in certain sectors.
- **Multifamily:** High volume of small delinquencies. The waterfall mechanics become administratively burdensome. Consider a simplified approach (e.g., seller retains the right to pursue any tenant more than 60 days delinquent at closing).
- **Data Center:** Delinquencies are rare given the critical nature of the service. Low risk.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** Rent stabilization and rent control laws may limit collection remedies.
- **California:** COVID-era tenant protection laws may still affect collection rights for pre-closing delinquencies.
- **All jurisdictions:** Ensure compliance with state-specific requirements for assignment of claims and standing to sue.

## 6. CAM/Operating Expense Reconciliations

### Preferred Position
Operating expense pass-throughs (CAM, taxes, insurance, management fees, and other reimbursable expenses) should be prorated at closing based on the best available information, with a mandatory post-closing true-up. For the year of closing, actual expenses incurred during the seller's period of ownership should be compared to the estimated payments collected from tenants during that same period. If the seller over-collected (estimates exceeded actuals), the buyer receives a credit. If the seller under-collected, the buyer bills tenants and remits the seller's share upon collection. The seller should provide a complete general ledger and supporting documentation within 60 days after closing.

**Cross-reference:** The Seller Income Property form (Section on Tenant Reconciliations and Post-Closing Adjustments) provides a detailed mechanism: "Within 60 days after closing, Seller shall prepare and present to Buyer a final calculation of Operating Expense Pass-throughs for Seller's period of ownership. Such final calculation shall include a general ledger pertaining to the portion of the year under Seller's ownership along with supporting documentation of tenant's calculations and base year determinations (if applicable). Buyer shall have 60 days from receipt to review said calculations." The Meadows form (Section 8.5) requires Seller to prepare and deliver a prorations schedule within 120 days after closing. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(e)) addresses this from the seller's perspective.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Seller prepares initial reconciliation:** Require the seller to prepare and deliver the initial operating expense reconciliation for its period of ownership, with full supporting documentation, within 60 days after closing. The seller has the historical data; forcing the buyer to reconstruct this from incomplete records is unreasonable.
- **Buyer review period:** The buyer should have at least 60 days to review the seller's reconciliation (per Seller Income Property form). This is essential for the buyer's property accountants to verify the calculations.
- **General ledger and backup:** Require delivery of the actual general ledger, not just a summary. Include base-year determinations, tenant calculation worksheets, and supporting invoices.
- **Over-collection credit:** If the seller over-collected estimated operating expense payments from tenants relative to actual expenses, the buyer must receive a credit equal to the excess. The buyer then becomes responsible for crediting or refunding the appropriate amounts to tenants.
- **Under-collection billing:** If the seller under-collected, the buyer should bill tenants for the deficiency and remit the seller's share upon collection, less reasonable collection costs. The buyer should not be required to fund the seller's under-collection from its own funds before collecting from tenants.
- **Tenant pass-through cap issues:** Some leases cap the tenant's reimbursement obligation (controllable expense caps, percentage increases, etc.). The proration must account for these caps, as the landlord may have incurred expenses that cannot be passed through.
- **Seller's no-obligation carve-out:** The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(c)) includes a provision that the seller has no obligation to prorate taxes or operating expenses to the extent the buyer is entitled to reimbursement from tenants. **Resist this.** The buyer's ability to collect from tenants is uncertain and should not eliminate the seller's proration obligation.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller wants buyer to prepare the reconciliation:** **Fallback:** Accept buyer preparation of the final reconciliation, but require the seller to deliver all books, records, and supporting documentation within 30 days after closing, and to remain available for questions for 90 days.
- **Seller wants to limit reconciliation to 90 days:** **Resist.** Operating expense reconciliation for the year of closing cannot be completed until after year-end. The reconciliation period should extend to at least 120 days after the end of the calendar year in which closing occurs.
- **Seller argues tenant reimbursement eliminates proration obligation:** Per the Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(c)(second paragraph)). **Reject.** The buyer should not bear the collection risk for the seller's operating expenses simply because a lease theoretically entitles the landlord to reimbursement.
- **Seller wants estimated prepayments retained:** If the seller collected estimated operating expense payments attributable to post-closing periods, those amounts must be credited to the buyer at closing. All source forms agree on this point.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk** if the property has complex operating expense structures, multiple base years, or tenants with expense caps. A miscalculated reconciliation can result in six-figure swings.
- **Medium risk** on standard NNN or modified gross properties where expense pass-through structures are straightforward.
- **Critical:** Review all leases for gross-up provisions, cap provisions, and base-year calculations during due diligence. These directly affect the proration.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office:** The most complex asset type for operating expense reconciliations. Base-year stops, controllable expense caps, and gross-up provisions create multiple layers of calculation.
- **Industrial:** Typically simpler NNN structures. Reconciliation is more straightforward.
- **Retail:** CAM reconciliations in retail are notoriously complex. Merchant association dues, marketing fund contributions, and percentage-of-occupancy-cost provisions all add layers. Require the seller to provide tenant-by-tenant CAM reconciliation worksheets.
- **Multifamily:** Typically no operating expense pass-throughs (except RUBS). Proration is simpler but may involve utility billing reconciliation.
- **Data Center:** Power and cooling costs are the dominant operating expense. Ensure metered utility reconciliation is addressed separately from CAM.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** Commercial lease tax implications may affect operating expense structures.
- **California:** Proposition 13 base-year issues create unique tax reconciliation challenges.
- **All jurisdictions:** Confirm that the lease form's definition of "operating expenses" aligns with the PSA's proration provisions.

## 7. Utility Prorations

### Preferred Position
All utility accounts should be read on the closing date and transferred to the buyer's name as of closing. The seller should be responsible for arranging final meter reads as close to closing as practicable. If final reads are not available at closing, utilities should be prorated based on the best available estimate and re-prorated within 30-60 days when actual bills are received. The seller should receive credit for any transferable utility deposits, and the buyer should post its own deposits.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 11.7.3) provides that utilities "shall be read on the Closing Date, and Buyer shall be responsible for all the necessary actions needed to arrange for meters to be read and utilities to be changed to the name of Buyer on the Closing Date." It further provides that "Seller shall be entitled to a credit at the Closing for any utility deposits which it or its predecessors have made prior to the Closing Date, to the extent the same are transferred to Buyer." The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(h)) similarly provides for final readings "if possible" with proration and readjustment within 30 days.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Meter read responsibility:** The UNICO forms place responsibility on the buyer to arrange meter reads. As a practical matter, the seller (who has the existing utility accounts) should cooperate. Negotiate for seller cooperation in arranging meter reads.
- **Estimated proration fallback:** If meters cannot be read on the closing date (common with water/sewer on municipal billing cycles), the parties should use the best estimate and true-up within 30-60 days.
- **Utility deposit credit:** The seller is entitled to a credit for transferable deposits. The buyer should verify the deposit amounts during due diligence.
- **No duplication with tenant pass-throughs:** The Meadows form (Section 8.4(d)) wisely provides "Without duplication of the apportionment for operating expense pass-throughs." Ensure that utility prorations do not double-count amounts already captured in the operating expense proration.
- **Bulk utility accounts:** Some properties (particularly multifamily) have master-metered utilities where the landlord pays the utility company and bills back tenants. Ensure the proration captures both the expense side and the reimbursement side.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller refuses to arrange final reads:** **Fallback:** Accept buyer responsibility for arranging reads, but require seller cooperation and authorization letters.
- **Seller wants to retain non-transferable deposits:** Per the UNICO Buyer Side form, "Seller shall be entitled to recover and retain from the providers of such utilities any refunds or overpayments to the extent applicable to the period prior to the Closing Date, and any utility deposits for which it does not receive a credit hereunder." This is reasonable.
- **Seller wants utility prorations excluded from post-closing true-up:** **Reject.** Utility bills often arrive weeks after closing. A 60-day window for reproration is essential.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** for standard commercial properties with sub-metered tenants.
- **Medium risk** for master-metered properties or properties with high utility costs (data centers, industrial facilities).

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Data Center:** Utility costs can be 30-50% of operating expenses. Final meter reads and accurate proration are critical. Consider whether power purchase agreements (PPAs) need to be assigned and prorated.
- **Industrial:** Large electricity consumers (manufacturing tenants) may have demand charges that are billed in arrears. Ensure demand charges are captured.
- **Multifamily:** RUBS (Ratio Utility Billing Systems) create complexity. The proration should address both the master-meter expense and the tenant reimbursement side.
- **Office/Retail:** Standard.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **All jurisdictions:** Utility deposit transfer rules vary by provider. Some utility companies will not transfer deposits and instead require the buyer to post a new deposit.

---

## 8. Insurance Prorations

### Preferred Position
Insurance policies should **not** be assigned to the buyer. The seller should maintain its insurance through the closing date, and the buyer should arrange its own insurance effective as of the closing date. No proration of insurance premiums should be made at closing.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 11.7.3) expressly provides: "none of the insurance policies relating to the Property will be assigned to Buyer and Buyer shall be responsible for arranging for its own insurance as of the Closing Date." This is the standard institutional approach.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **No assignment of policies:** Institutional buyers universally prefer to place their own insurance through their portfolio programs. Assigning the seller's policies creates coverage gaps, endorsement issues, and potential claims complications.
- **Overlap period:** If closing occurs mid-day, ensure there is no gap in coverage. The buyer's policy should be effective at 12:01 a.m. on the closing date.
- **Tenant insurance requirements:** The buyer should verify during due diligence that all tenants are carrying required insurance. This is not a proration issue but is related to the insurance transition.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller wants buyer to assume existing policy:** This is rare in institutional transactions. **Reject.** If the seller insists (perhaps because the policy is a portfolio policy that provides favorable terms), negotiate for an assignment with the buyer's right to cancel and replace within 30 days.
- **Seller wants credit for prepaid premium:** If policies are assigned, the buyer should receive a credit for the unearned premium. If policies are not assigned (the preferred approach), there is no proration.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** if the standard non-assignment approach is used.
- **Medium risk** if policies are assigned, due to potential coverage gaps and endorsement issues.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No significant variation across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Florida/Gulf Coast:** Windstorm insurance may be placed through state programs (Citizens Property Insurance Corporation). Verify transferability.
- **California:** Earthquake insurance is typically separate. Verify the buyer's ability to obtain earthquake coverage on the same terms.

## 9. Security Deposit Credits

### Preferred Position
All tenant security deposits (cash and non-cash) should be transferred or credited to the buyer at closing. Cash deposits should be credited against the purchase price. Letters of credit should be transferred to the buyer at closing, with the seller executing all documents necessary to effect the transfer. If a letter of credit is not transferable by its terms, the seller should cooperate post-closing to facilitate reissuance in the buyer's name. Any interest accrued on security deposits that is required to be paid to tenants should also be credited to the buyer.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 7.4 / 11.7.1(b)) provides: "Buyer shall receive at Closing a credit for all cash security deposits delivered to Seller pursuant to the Leases." The Meadows form (Section 8.4(b)) provides: "All Tenant security deposits (and interest thereon if required by law or contract to be earned thereon) shall be transferred or credited to Buyer at the Closing. Any letters of credit or other non-cash Tenant security deposits held by Seller shall be transferred and re-issued to Buyer." The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(b)) provides for security deposit credits and requires a "letter agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit K" for letters of credit.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Credit vs. transfer:** Cash deposits should be credited against the purchase price (reducing the cash due at closing). The buyer should not have to rely on a post-closing wire from the seller.
- **Letters of credit:** Require the seller to deliver original letters of credit at closing together with all transfer documents. If the LOC issuing bank charges a transfer fee, negotiate who bears the cost (the buyer's preferred position is that the seller pays, as this is an obligation arising from the seller's period of ownership).
- **Non-transferable LOCs:** If a letter of credit is not transferable, the seller should deliver the original LOC at closing, provide reasonable cooperation to facilitate reissuance, and provide the buyer with the underlying security deposit in cash until the new LOC is in place.
- **Interest on deposits:** In jurisdictions that require interest to be paid on security deposits (New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, and others), the buyer should receive a credit for accrued interest as of closing.
- **Applied deposits:** Verify during due diligence that no security deposits have been applied to cover tenant defaults without proper documentation. The rent roll should reconcile with the security deposit schedule.
- **Assumption of obligations:** Following closing, the buyer assumes the seller's obligations to return security deposits to tenants, but only to the extent deposits were actually credited or transferred to the buyer. The UNICO Buyer Side form includes this important limitation.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller wants to deliver deposits post-closing rather than credit at closing:** **Reject.** Post-closing delivery creates collection risk. Always credit against the purchase price.
- **Seller claims deposits were applied to cure tenant defaults:** Require documentation during due diligence. If deposits were properly applied, the tenant should have replenished them. If not, the buyer should receive a credit for the original deposit amount.
- **Seller wants buyer to bear LOC transfer costs:** **Fallback:** Split transfer fees equally, or have the tenant bear the cost if the lease permits.
- **Seller refuses to cooperate on non-transferable LOC reissuance:** Include an express surviving covenant requiring cooperation for up to 90 days post-closing.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** for cash deposits credited at closing.
- **Medium risk** for letter-of-credit transfers, particularly if the issuing bank is slow or uncooperative.
- **High risk** if the seller has applied deposits without documentation, as the buyer may have liability to return deposits it never received.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office:** Security deposits are common but may be in LOC form for larger tenants. LOC transfer mechanics are critical.
- **Industrial:** Similar to office.
- **Retail:** Security deposits are common for smaller tenants. Major anchors may not have security deposits.
- **Multifamily:** High volume of small cash deposits. State laws governing security deposit handling are strict and vary significantly.
- **Data Center:** Large security deposits (sometimes 3-6 months' rent) are common. LOC form is typical.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** General Obligations Law Section 7-103 requires security deposits to be held in trust and in an interest-bearing account. Specific rules apply to how deposits must be handled upon sale.
- **Illinois:** The Security Deposit Return Act requires return within specified timeframes and imposes penalties for non-compliance.
- **California:** Civil Code Section 1950.7 governs commercial security deposits. Transferee liability is imposed by statute.
- **Massachusetts:** Strict security deposit statutes (Chapter 186, Section 15B) with treble damages for violations. The transfer must comply with statutory notice requirements.

---

## 10. Prepaid Rents

### Preferred Position
Any rents or other tenant charges prepaid to the seller for periods after the closing date should be credited to the buyer at closing. This includes any advance rent payments, prepaid operating expense estimates, prepaid parking fees, and any other prepaid charges. The credit should be applied as a reduction of the purchase price.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 7.4) provides: "Any sums designated as prepaid rent under the Leases shall be credited against the Purchase Price." The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(b)) provides: "any Rent received by Seller and applicable to any period after the month in which the Closing occurs" shall be credited to the buyer.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Comprehensive definition:** Ensure "prepaid rent" includes all forms of advance payment, not just base rent. Operating expense estimates paid in advance, parking prepayments, and any other amounts received for post-closing periods should be included.
- **Credit vs. trust:** The preferred approach is a credit against the purchase price. Some seller forms provide that prepaid amounts will be "held in trust" and remitted post-closing. **Reject** this approach in favor of a closing credit.
- **Last month's rent deposits:** Some leases provide for a "last month's rent" deposit in addition to a security deposit. These should be credited to the buyer at closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller disputes characterization of payment as "prepaid":** Require supporting documentation during due diligence.
- **Seller wants to retain prepaid amounts and remit post-closing:** **Reject.** Always take the credit at closing.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** if properly identified during due diligence and credited at closing.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No significant variation. Applies across all asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Governed primarily by lease terms rather than statute.

---

## 11. Tenant Improvement Allowances and Leasing Commissions

### Preferred Position
All TI allowances and leasing commissions ("Leasing Costs") should be categorized as either (a) existing obligations under leases in effect as of the effective date, or (b) new obligations arising from leases entered into or renewed after the effective date. For existing obligations, the seller should pay all amounts that are due or have been incurred through the closing date, and the buyer should receive a credit at closing for all remaining unpaid Existing Leasing Costs. For new leasing costs arising from leases approved by the buyer during the pre-closing period, the buyer should assume responsibility.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 7.3) provides the most detailed treatment:
- "Leasing Costs" is defined broadly to include "tenant improvement costs, lease buyout payments, and moving, design, and refurbishment costs" (Section 7.3.1).
- "Existing Leasing Costs" are identified on an exhibit, and the buyer receives a credit at closing for all unpaid existing leasing costs less amounts the seller has already paid (Section 7.3.2).
- "New Leasing Costs" (for leases entered into or renewed after the due diligence deadline that were approved by the buyer) are the buyer's responsibility (Section 7.3.3).

The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(m) / definition of "Purchaser Lease Expenses") takes a markedly different approach, making virtually all leasing costs the buyer's responsibility, including costs under existing leases that are payable on or after the closing date.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Existing vs. new cost allocation:** The buyer's position is that the seller should fully fund all leasing costs that were committed before the effective date, regardless of when payment is due. The credit at closing should cover all remaining unpaid amounts under existing leases. The Detailed Seller Side form's approach (making all post-closing-payable leasing costs the buyer's responsibility, even under existing leases) is extremely seller-favorable and should be resisted.
- **Exhibit of existing leasing costs:** Require the seller to prepare and attach an exhibit identifying all outstanding TI allowances, leasing commissions, and other leasing costs as of the effective date (per UNICO Buyer Side, Section 7.3.2, Exhibit L).
- **Updated statement before closing:** Require the seller to deliver an updated statement of leasing costs paid between the effective date and closing, with supporting documentation, no later than 5 business days before closing (per UNICO Buyer Side, Section 7.3.2).
- **Pipeline leases:** Leases that are in negotiation but not yet executed at closing present a special challenge. The buyer should have approval rights over all new leases (per the standard operating covenant), and the allocation of leasing costs should follow the approval:
  - If the lease was approved by the buyer and executed before closing, the costs should be allocated as New Leasing Costs (buyer's responsibility).
  - If the lease was being negotiated at closing but the buyer did not approve it, the buyer has no obligation for its leasing costs.
  - If the seller executed a lease after the due diligence deadline without the buyer's required consent, all leasing costs should be the seller's responsibility.
- **Free rent periods:** The UNICO Buyer Side form does not directly address free rent. The Detailed Seller Side form (definition of "Lease Expenses") provides: "Lease Expenses shall not include loss of income resulting from any free rental period (it being agreed that Seller shall bear such loss resulting from any free rental period with respect to the period prior to the Closing and that Purchaser shall bear such loss with respect to the period from and after the Closing)." This is a reasonable allocation -- each party bears the lost income during its period of ownership. Adopt this approach.
- **In-process TI work:** The Seller Income Property form includes a bracketed provision for "In Process TI Work" that provides for an escrow holdback from the purchase price, with the buyer completing the work and the seller receiving any excess escrowed funds. This is a sound approach and should be negotiated into the PSA.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller wants buyer to assume all post-closing leasing costs:** Per the Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(m)). **Resist.** The purchase price should reflect the in-place income, and the cost to achieve that income (TI/LC) should be the seller's burden for existing leases.
  - **First fallback:** Accept buyer responsibility for leasing costs under existing leases, but only if those costs were already factored into the purchase price (i.e., the price was reduced accordingly).
  - **Second fallback:** Accept buyer responsibility, but require the seller to escrow an amount equal to all unfunded leasing costs.
- **Seller refuses to provide an exhibit of existing leasing costs:** **Reject.** Without this exhibit, the buyer cannot verify the scope of its assumed obligations. Make this a due diligence deliverable and a condition to closing.
- **Seller argues new lease leasing costs should be shared:** Some sellers argue that leasing costs for new leases executed during the contract period should be shared based on the lease's contribution to value. **Reject.** If the buyer approved the lease (which is required under the operating covenant), the buyer should bear the full cost, but this was already accounted for in the buyer's approval decision.
- **Seller wants free rent periods fully borne by the buyer:** **Resist.** Free rent that falls during the seller's period of ownership should reduce the seller's income proration, not be a cost shifted to the buyer.

### Risk Assessment
- **Very high risk.** Unfunded TI/LC obligations can represent millions of dollars on a large office or retail property. Due diligence must include a complete inventory of all existing leasing costs, with verification against the leases and commission agreements.
- **Particular risk areas:**
  - Leases with phased TI delivery (where the full allowance has not been disbursed).
  - Commission agreements with "tail" provisions (commissions payable on renewals).
  - Tenant improvement work that is in progress at closing.
  - Recently executed leases with large concession packages.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office:** The highest exposure. Institutional office leases routinely include TI allowances of $50-$100+ per square foot and leasing commissions of 3-5% of aggregate rent. A 200,000 SF office building with 30% rollover exposure could have $5M+ in unfunded TI/LC.
- **Industrial:** Lower TI costs (often $5-$15/SF for warehouse, higher for lab/flex). Leasing commissions are meaningful.
- **Retail:** TI allowances vary widely. Anchor tenants may have large allowances; inline tenants may have minimal allowances. Tenant coordination fees are an additional cost.
- **Multifamily:** No TI allowances. Unit renovation costs are capital expenditures, not tenant-specific leasing costs.
- **Data Center:** Shell-condition delivery is common, with tenants building out their own spaces. TI allowances may be minimal, but infrastructure contributions can be significant.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant jurisdictional variation. This is primarily a contractual and economic allocation issue.

---

## 12. Free Rent Periods

### Preferred Position
Free rent periods should be allocated based on the period in which the free rent falls. The seller bears the economic loss of free rent for its period of ownership (reduced income proration), and the buyer bears the loss for the post-closing period. The buyer should receive a credit at closing only if the seller collected rent for a period that is subsequently a free rent period for the buyer (which would be unusual).

**Cross-reference:** The Detailed Seller Side form (definition of "Lease Expenses") provides the clearest formulation: "Seller shall bear such loss resulting from any free rental period with respect to the period prior to the Closing and that Purchaser shall bear such loss with respect to the period from and after the Closing."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Distinction between free rent and rent abatement:** Free rent is typically a fixed period at the beginning of a lease term or upon renewal. Rent abatement may be triggered by a landlord default or casualty. Ensure the PSA addresses both.
- **Phased free rent:** Some leases provide free rent in non-consecutive months (e.g., months 1, 7, 13). Ensure the proration captures which specific free-rent months fall within each party's period of ownership.
- **Interaction with TI/LC allocation:** Free rent is sometimes negotiated as part of a broader concession package. Ensure that the free rent allocation is consistent with the TI/LC allocation (i.e., the buyer should not bear both the free rent loss and reimburse the seller for TI costs under the same lease).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller wants buyer to bear all free rent regardless of period:** **Reject.** This would allow the seller to enter into leases with front-loaded free rent and shift the cost to the buyer.
- **Fallback:** If the property has significant free rent exposure in the near term (e.g., a major lease recently signed with 12 months of free rent, 6 of which fall in the buyer's period), consider a purchase price adjustment rather than a proration credit.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk.** Free rent can be a significant cost on newly leased spaces. Due diligence should identify all free rent periods and model the cash flow impact.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office:** Free rent periods of 6-18 months are common on new leases in competitive markets.
- **Industrial:** Shorter free rent periods (1-6 months) are typical.
- **Retail:** Variable. Anchor tenants may negotiate significant free rent; inline tenants typically have minimal free rent.
- **Multifamily:** Concessions (1-2 months free) are common in lease-up or market downturns.
- **Data Center:** Limited free rent, but "ramp-up" periods with reduced power charges may function similarly.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant jurisdictional variation.

---

## 13. Post-Closing Reconciliation Mechanics

### Preferred Position
The PSA should provide for a comprehensive post-closing reconciliation process with the following elements: (1) an initial reconciliation of all items not finally determined at closing, to be completed within 60 days after closing; (2) a year-end operating expense true-up, to be completed within 120 days after the end of the calendar year in which closing occurs; (3) mutual audit rights for 12 months following final reconciliation; (4) express surviving obligations for all proration and reconciliation provisions. The buyer should have the right to inspect the seller's books and records for a period of at least one year after closing.

**Cross-reference:** The Meadows form (Section 8.5) provides for two separate reconciliation processes: (a) an initial proration reconciliation within 60 days after closing, and (b) a pass-through expense true-up within 120 days after closing, with the seller preparing the reconciliation. The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 11.9) provides for a 90-day reconciliation window. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(k)) provides for a 60-day initial reconciliation with a 6-month survival period for proration obligations.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Timeline:** The buyer needs sufficient time for the year-end true-up, which depends on receiving actual expense data for the full calendar year. The initial 60-day reconciliation addresses items that can be determined shortly after closing. The year-end true-up should have a 120-day window after calendar year-end (per Meadows form, Section 8.5(b)).
- **Who prepares the reconciliation:** The buyer prefers that the seller prepare the initial reconciliation (the seller has the historical data). The UNICO Buyer Side form puts the burden on the parties jointly. The Meadows form puts the initial reconciliation on the buyer (Section 8.5(a)) but the pass-through true-up on the seller (Section 8.5(b)). The Seller Income Property form requires the seller to prepare the final operating expense calculation.
- **Finality:** The Meadows form provides that the initial adjusting payment "shall be considered final and no additional post-Closing adjustment for any incorrect proration or adjustment shall be made." **Resist this for the buyer.** The buyer should always have the right to challenge errors discovered within the reconciliation period.
- **Audit rights:** Require access to the seller's books and records for at least 12 months after closing (per Meadows form, Section 8.6). The UNICO Buyer Side form similarly provides for audit access "until final reconciliation." The buyer should push for 12 months regardless of when reconciliation is completed.
- **Survival:** All proration and reconciliation obligations must expressly survive the closing. The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 11.7.1) includes an express survival provision for tax adjustments. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(k)) limits survival to 6 months. **Push for 12 months minimum.**
- **Dispute resolution:** If the parties disagree on the reconciliation, include a mechanism for resolution (e.g., submission to an independent CPA whose determination is binding).
- **Seller entity preservation:** Require that the seller entity not be dissolved or wound up until all reconciliation obligations have been satisfied. This is critical for institutional sellers that may dissolve the single-purpose entity after closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller wants 60-90 day reconciliation window with finality:** **Fallback:** Accept 90 days for the initial reconciliation, but require a separate year-end true-up process with its own timeline extending to 120 days after calendar year-end.
- **Seller wants to limit audit rights to 90 days:** **Fallback:** Accept 6 months minimum, but push for 12 months.
- **Seller resists survival period:** **Fallback:** Accept 6 months for general prorations but insist on 12 months for operating expense reconciliation (which requires year-end data).
- **Seller wants "best efforts" reconciliation standard:** **Reject.** Require actual reconciliation with supporting documentation.
- **Seller refuses entity preservation covenant:** **Fallback:** Require a guaranty from the seller's parent entity or a holdback in escrow equal to the estimated maximum reconciliation exposure.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk** without adequate post-closing reconciliation mechanics. The most common source of post-closing disputes in commercial acquisitions is proration reconciliation.
- **Critical items requiring post-closing reconciliation:** Real property taxes (if current-year bills unavailable), operating expense pass-throughs, utility bills, percentage rent, and any items estimated at closing.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office:** Longest reconciliation periods due to complex operating expense structures.
- **Industrial:** Shorter reconciliation periods (NNN structures simplify the process).
- **Retail:** Lengthy reconciliation due to CAM, percentage rent, and marketing fund true-ups.
- **Multifamily:** Shorter reconciliation periods (fewer tenant-specific adjustments).
- **Data Center:** Power cost reconciliation can extend over several billing cycles.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant jurisdictional variation, though survival periods may interact with statute-of-limitations requirements.

## 14. Rent-Ready Adjustments and Vacancy Cost Allocation

### Preferred Position
The buyer should not be responsible for any costs to bring vacant units or spaces to "rent-ready" condition as of closing, to the extent such costs result from deferred maintenance or damage during the seller's period of ownership. The PSA should require the seller to deliver all common areas and vacant spaces in good condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted. If vacant spaces require capital improvements or deferred maintenance to be leased, the buyer should receive a credit at closing equal to the estimated cost, or the seller should be required to complete the work before closing.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Definition of "rent-ready":** Agree on what constitutes rent-ready condition: broom-clean, all building systems operational, no deferred maintenance, code-compliant. Attach a punch-list protocol to the PSA.
- **Credit vs. escrow vs. seller performance:** The buyer's preferred approach is a credit at closing (allowing the buyer to control the work). Alternatively, an escrow can be established if the costs are not yet determined. Requiring the seller to complete the work before closing creates delay risk.
- **Interaction with "as-is" provisions:** Most institutional PSAs include "as-is" purchase provisions. The rent-ready adjustment must be carved out from the "as-is" provision, or it will be waived. The buyer should negotiate this as a specific proration/adjustment item, not as a general property condition matter.
- **Vacancy cost allocation during contract period:** If a tenant vacates during the contract period (between effective date and closing), the buyer should receive a credit for the lost rent during its period of ownership plus the cost to restore the space to rent-ready condition.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller argues "as-is" purchase precludes rent-ready adjustments:** **Respond:** The proration provisions are separate from the condition-of-property provisions. The rent-ready adjustment is an economic allocation, not a property condition warranty.
- **Seller refuses any credit for vacant spaces:** **Fallback:** Accept no credit for existing vacancies known during due diligence (which should have been priced into the offer), but require a credit for any new vacancies arising between the effective date and closing.
- **Seller wants buyer to bear all vacancy costs:** **Fallback:** Accept vacancy cost responsibility from closing forward, but require the seller to deliver vacant spaces in broom-clean, marketable condition.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk.** The economic exposure depends on the vacancy rate and the condition of vacant spaces. A large office property with 20% vacancy and deferred maintenance could have significant rent-ready costs.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office:** Rent-ready costs can be significant (demolition of prior tenant improvements, asbestos abatement, code upgrades). Typically $15-$40/SF to bring a vacant office floor to "warm vanilla shell" condition.
- **Industrial:** Lower per-SF costs, but large spaces mean the total can be meaningful.
- **Retail:** Varies by tenant type. Anchor boxes may require significant work; inline spaces are typically delivered as warm shells.
- **Multifamily:** Unit turnover costs are well-understood. Standard unit turns cost $2,000-$10,000 depending on market and condition. Major renovations (kitchen/bath) are capital improvements.
- **Data Center:** Vacant data halls may require significant infrastructure investment (power, cooling, connectivity).

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **All jurisdictions:** Building code compliance requirements for vacant spaces vary by jurisdiction and may trigger additional costs.

## 15. Closing Costs Allocation

### Preferred Position
The following allocation of closing costs is the buyer's preferred position, consistent with the UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 11.6):

| Cost Item | Buyer | Seller |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Standard owner's title policy | | X |
| Extended coverage / endorsements | X | |
| Escrow fee | 50% | 50% |
| Transfer taxes / documentary stamps | | X |
| Recording fees (deed) | X | |
| Survey costs | X | |
| Buyer's due diligence costs | X | |
| Seller's legal fees | | X |
| Buyer's legal fees | X | |

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 11.6.1-11.6.3) allocates: Seller pays the standard owner's title policy premium and 50% of escrow fees. Buyer pays extended coverage, endorsements, 50% of escrow fees, survey costs, and due diligence costs. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(l)) splits transfer taxes and escrow fees 50/50 and makes the buyer pay all title and survey costs (more seller-favorable).

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Transfer taxes:** The most significant variable. The buyer's position is that all transfer taxes are the seller's responsibility. The seller will argue for a 50/50 split or full buyer responsibility, depending on local custom.
- **Title insurance:** The seller should pay for the standard owner's policy. The buyer pays for extended coverage and lender's policy costs.
- **Escrow fees:** 50/50 split is standard and generally non-controversial.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller wants buyer to pay transfer taxes:** Follow local custom as the baseline. In many jurisdictions, the seller customarily pays. In others (e.g., certain northeast markets), costs are split.
- **Seller wants buyer to pay the full title premium:** **Resist.** The standard owner's policy premium is customarily the seller's obligation in most western and southern states. In the northeast, this may vary.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk** depending on transfer tax rates. NYC transfer taxes alone can exceed 2.625% of the purchase price.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No significant variation by asset type, but transfer tax rates may differ for commercial vs. residential properties in some jurisdictions.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** Real Property Transfer Tax (state: 0.4%) plus NYC Real Property Transfer Tax (up to 2.625% for properties over $500,000). Mortgage recording tax (up to 2.80%) may apply if a new mortgage is recorded. Per the NY Checklist, the seller customarily pays the transfer tax.
- **California:** Documentary transfer tax varies by county and city. San Francisco has a graduated rate up to 6%.
- **Illinois:** Transfer taxes at state, county, and city (Chicago) levels.
- **Washington:** Real estate excise tax (REET) is paid by the seller per the Seller Income Property form.
- **Colorado:** Low transfer taxes. Documentary fee is nominal.

*This playbook should be read in conjunction with the operating covenant provisions (which govern the seller's ability to enter into new leases and incur new leasing costs during the contract period) and the closing conditions provisions (which may condition closing on satisfactory proration agreement).*
