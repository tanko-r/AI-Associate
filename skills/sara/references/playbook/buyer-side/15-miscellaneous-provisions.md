## Notice Provisions

### Preferred Position

Buyer should ensure that the notice provision permits the broadest range of delivery methods and that email constitutes a valid, standalone notice method without any requirement for a concurrent "hard copy" follow-up. The preferred buyer position treats email as a primary notice method co-equal with overnight courier and certified mail, with notice effective upon transmission during business hours. This is critical because in a fast-moving transaction, the ability to send a timely termination notice, objection notice, or default notice by email can be outcome-determinative.

**Preferred language (derived from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.1):**

> All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the parties at the following addresses [addresses and copies]. All notices must be sent by (a) certified mail, return receipt requested, in which case notice shall be deemed delivered 3 Business Days after deposit, postage prepaid in the U.S. mail, (b) a recognized and reputable overnight courier, in which case notice shall be deemed delivered 1 Business Day after deposit with such courier if deposited with the courier service on or before 5:00 p.m. [local] Time on a Business Day and otherwise 2 Business Days after being deposited with the courier service, or (c) email transmission, in which case notice shall be deemed delivered upon transmission if the transmission is made on a Business Day on or before 5:00 p.m. [local] Time and otherwise the next Business Day after the transmission is made.

Key structural elements:

- Email is an independent, standalone delivery method -- no requirement for a concurrent hard copy.
- Notice is effective upon transmission (not receipt) for email, which protects the sender from arguments about server delays or spam filters.
- The 5:00 p.m. cutoff ties to a specific time zone and uses Business Days for after-hours transmissions.
- Copy recipients (buyer's counsel) are specified but failure to send copies should not invalidate the primary notice.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Insist that email notice is effective without a concurrent hard-copy follow-up. The Meadows form (Section 9.1) requires that if notice is given via email, "an original counterpart of such communication shall concurrently be sent" by hand delivery -- this is a seller-favorable trap that can invalidate an otherwise timely email notice. Reject this formulation.
- Ensure the notice addresses include Buyer's counsel as a copy recipient, and negotiate that notice is not effective against Buyer unless the copy is also sent. This provides a safety net against missed notices.
- Specify that changes of address require actual receipt of a change-of-address notice, not merely compliance with the notice provision itself (both UNICO forms include this).
- For the time-zone reference, use the time zone of the Property location (the UNICO forms use Pacific Time). In multi-property portfolio deals, specify one governing time zone.
- Negotiate that refusal to accept delivery or inability to deliver due to an unreported address change constitutes effective notice on the date of attempted delivery (the Meadows form includes this).
- Include Escrow Agent as a notice party with its own address block, since many critical notices (termination, default, extension) require concurrent delivery to escrow.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Email should not be a standalone notice method because of the risk of spam filters, server outages, and the inability to verify receipt. Seller may insist on overnight courier or certified mail as the only valid methods, or require email to be accompanied by hard copy.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Accept that email notice is effective only upon transmission without a bounce-back or delivery failure notification. This addresses the seller's concern about undeliverable emails while preserving email as a standalone method.
2. **Second fallback:** Accept that email is a valid method but notice is effective upon the sender's receipt of a read receipt or delivery confirmation from the recipient's mail server. This adds a verification step but still avoids the hard-copy requirement.
3. **Third fallback:** Accept that email notice must be followed by overnight courier within one Business Day, but the effective date of notice is the date of email transmission (not the date the hard copy is delivered). This is a compromise that preserves the timing advantage of email.
4. **Last resort:** Accept email only for non-critical, day-to-day communications, with all formal notices (termination, default, extension) requiring overnight courier. This is a significant concession and should be resisted.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** -- In a transaction with tight contractual deadlines (e.g., last day of diligence period, cure period expiration), the difference between email notice being effective upon transmission vs. requiring a concurrent hard copy can determine whether the buyer preserves a termination right or is deemed to have waived it. The Meadows form's concurrent-hard-copy requirement is a known trap in seller-favorable agreements.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Data Center:** Include secure-messaging or encrypted-email protocols as acceptable notice methods if the parties use enterprise communication systems that provide audit trails superior to standard email.
- **Multifamily (scattered site portfolio):** In portfolio transactions with multiple seller entities, ensure the notice provision permits a single notice address for all seller entities rather than requiring separate notices to each entity.
- **Retail (ground lease parcels):** Where the PSA involves assignment of ground leases, verify that the PSA notice provision does not conflict with notice requirements under the ground lease.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** New York courts have enforced strict compliance with contractual notice provisions. Failure to send notice to a required copy recipient can invalidate the notice. Ensure the provision states that failure to send copies does not invalidate the primary notice.
- **California:** California Civil Code Section 1946 and related statutes may impose specific notice requirements for certain lease-related matters that override contractual provisions. Ensure the PSA notice provision is drafted to comply with statutory requirements for any notices that may also serve as lease notices.
- **Texas:** Texas courts generally enforce contractual notice provisions as drafted. There is no statutory override for commercial transactions.
- **Illinois:** Illinois courts have held that email can constitute "written notice" under commercial contracts even absent explicit authorization, but best practice is to include email expressly.

## Confidentiality and Press Releases

### Preferred Position

Buyer should negotiate for the broadest possible set of permitted disclosures while maintaining the confidentiality of Seller's proprietary operating information. The buyer's primary concern is ensuring it can freely share transaction information with its investors, lenders, joint venture partners, consultants, legal counsel, accountants, and potential assignees without restriction. The buyer should also negotiate for the right to issue press releases and marketing materials after Closing without Seller's consent.

**Preferred language framework (derived from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 14):**

The confidentiality provision should include:

1. **Broad definition of Confidential Information** with market-standard carve-outs for: (w) publicly available information, (x) previously known information, (y) information received from non-breaching third parties, and (z) independently developed information.

2. **Extensive list of Permitted Recipients** including: existing and potential investors, joint venture partners, lenders, officers, employees, attorneys, advisors, consultants, Affiliates, and their respective agents. The UNICO forms (both buyer and seller, Section 14.2) include this comprehensive list.

3. **Permitted disclosures for legal/regulatory compliance** including judicial or governmental orders, with the disclosing party giving the other party reasonable opportunity to seek a protective order.

4. **Termination of confidentiality upon Closing** -- The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 14.4) provides that "The parties' obligations under this Section 14 shall terminate if and when Closing occurs." Buyer should insist on this formulation so that post-Closing, the buyer is free to discuss the acquisition with tenants, brokers, market participants, and the public.

5. **Right to issue press releases after Closing** without Seller consent. Pre-Closing press releases should require mutual consent.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the list of Permitted Recipients is not artificially narrowed. Some seller forms limit disclosures to "existing" investors and lenders only -- buyer needs "existing and potential" to cover capital-raising and financing efforts.
- Negotiate that the obligation to inform Permitted Recipients of the confidential nature of the information is sufficient -- do not accept language requiring Buyer to obtain signed NDAs from every Permitted Recipient before disclosure.
- Verify that the confidentiality provision does not restrict Buyer's ability to share information with rating agencies, insurance underwriters, appraisers, and environmental consultants, all of whom are essential to the diligence and financing process.
- Resist any "return or destroy" obligation that requires Buyer to return all diligence materials if the deal does not close. Buyer needs to retain materials for record-keeping, potential litigation, and re-evaluation of future opportunities. At most, accept a requirement to use reasonable efforts to return or destroy Seller's proprietary materials (but not copies in legal files or electronic backups).
- The NY Checklist (Confidentiality and Press Releases) notes that buyers should "Negotiate the right for the purchaser to issue a press release after the closing" and should expect sellers to negotiate for "nondisclosure agreements from all parties accessing the seller's information" and "a ban on disclosing the financial terms of the transaction without the seller's consent." Push back on both.
- Confirm that the confidentiality provision explicitly supersedes any prior NDA or confidentiality agreement (see UNICO Seller Side, Section 14.5: the Prior NDA is "hereby deemed superseded, replaced and terminated by this Agreement").

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** (1) Confidentiality should survive Closing because sensitive operating data (NOI, tenant financials, cap rates) remains commercially sensitive; (2) Buyer should be required to obtain NDAs from all Permitted Recipients; (3) Press releases, even post-Closing, should require mutual consent to protect Seller's market reputation and relationships.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Accept that confidentiality of specific categories of information (e.g., tenant financial statements, pending lease negotiations) survives Closing for 6 months, but all other confidentiality obligations terminate at Closing.
2. **Second fallback:** Accept a 12-month post-Closing survival period (matching the UNICO Seller Side, Section 14.4 post-termination survival) but only for non-public financial information -- not for the existence of the transaction or the purchase price.
3. **Third fallback:** Accept that post-Closing press releases require "reasonable consultation" with Seller (not consent) and that neither party will disclose the purchase price in a press release unless it is publicly available through recording or transfer tax records.
4. **Last resort:** Accept mutual consent for press releases but with a deemed-consent mechanism if the other party does not respond within 3 Business Days.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** -- Overly restrictive confidentiality provisions can impede the buyer's ability to raise equity, secure financing, and market the asset post-Closing. The most significant risk is a confidentiality provision that survives Closing indefinitely and restricts the buyer's ability to share operating data with lenders during refinancing or with brokers during a future disposition.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily:** Marketing materials and rent comparables are commonly shared with market data services (CoStar, RealPage, Yardi Matrix). Ensure the confidentiality provision does not restrict participation in market surveys.
- **Data Center:** Data center transactions often involve highly sensitive tenant information (customer identities, power consumption, SLAs). Additional confidentiality protections for tenant-specific data may be appropriate even in a buyer-favorable agreement.
- **Retail:** Tenant sales data is typically confidential under lease provisions. Ensure the PSA confidentiality provision does not create obligations beyond what the leases already require.
- **Office (trophy/HQ):** High-profile office acquisitions frequently attract press attention. Negotiate an explicit carve-out permitting buyer to respond to media inquiries about publicly available information (recording data, transfer taxes).

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Transfer tax filings are public record, making the purchase price publicly available shortly after Closing. Confidentiality provisions purporting to prohibit disclosure of the purchase price are effectively moot in NYC transactions.
- **California:** The purchase price is not typically disclosed in public recordings (California does not require transfer tax stamps on the deed). Documentary transfer tax declarations are confidential in some counties.
- **Massachusetts:** Transfer taxes are public, making price confidentiality difficult to maintain.
- **Delaware (entity-level transfers):** Where the transaction is structured as an entity-level transfer rather than a deed conveyance, the purchase price may not appear in any public record, making confidentiality provisions more meaningful.

## Brokerage Provisions

### Preferred Position

Buyer should ensure that: (1) Seller bears sole responsibility for paying all brokerage commissions, including any commission owed to Buyer's broker (if the deal was sourced through a seller-engaged listing broker who agreed to cooperate with buyer's broker); (2) each party provides mutual cross-indemnities against brokerage claims arising from the other party's contacts; and (3) the brokerage provision expressly survives Closing and termination.

**Preferred language (derived from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 15):**

> Each of Buyer and Seller represents and warrants to the other that it did not employ or use any broker or finder to arrange or bring about this transaction, except for Seller's Broker and Buyer's Broker (if any are identified in Section 1.12 or 1.13 above) and that there are no claims or rights for brokerage commissions or finder's fees in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising out of actions or statements by the representing party except to the extent otherwise provided in this Section. If any person brings a claim against Seller for a commission or finder's fee based upon any contact, dealings or communication with Buyer... then Buyer shall defend Seller from such claim, and shall indemnify Seller and hold Seller harmless from any and all costs, damages, claims, liabilities or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements).... [Reciprocal indemnity from Seller to Buyer for claims based on Seller's contacts.]

### Key Negotiation Points

- Confirm that Seller's separate brokerage agreement (typically with a listing broker) obligates Seller to pay the full commission, including any cooperating commission to Buyer's broker. Buyer should not be responsible for any commission.
- The representation should be mutual -- each party warrants it has not engaged brokers other than those identified. The indemnification should likewise be mutual and reciprocal.
- The NY Checklist notes: "Confirm that the seller must pay the brokerage commission to the seller's broker; and the purchaser's broker, if any, shares the commission with the seller's broker." This is the standard institutional structure.
- Include a representation that there are no tail provisions or override agreements that could give rise to a claim by a previously engaged broker.
- The income property seller form (Section 31) includes additional buyer-protective language: "Broker shall not be entitled to any monies or other recovery realized by Seller arising out of Buyer's default. Broker shall not be entitled to any commission if Buyer or Seller elect to terminate this Agreement." Buyer should ensure similar language appears.
- The brokerage indemnity should expressly survive Closing and termination (see income property seller form, Section 31: "This Section shall expressly survive any Closing or any termination of this Agreement").

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Buyer should bear the cost of its own broker, or at minimum, Buyer should indemnify Seller against any claims by Buyer's broker if Seller has not separately agreed to pay a cooperating commission.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Accept that if Buyer has separately engaged a buyer's broker who is not a cooperating broker under Seller's listing agreement, Buyer is responsible for that commission -- but only pursuant to a separate agreement between Buyer and Buyer's broker that does not create any obligation on Seller.
2. **Second fallback:** Accept a cap on the cooperating commission that Seller will pay to Buyer's broker, with Buyer responsible for any excess.
3. **Third fallback:** If Buyer is using no broker, add an affirmative representation to that effect and obtain Seller's indemnity against any claim by Seller's broker against Buyer.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** -- Brokerage disputes are among the most common post-Closing claims in commercial real estate transactions. An incomplete brokerage provision can expose the buyer to commission claims by brokers it never engaged. The indemnification provisions are the primary protection against this risk.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail (NNN):** Net lease transactions frequently involve multiple brokers (listing broker, cooperating broker, tenant-rep broker). Ensure the provision accounts for all potential claimants.
- **Multifamily:** Multifamily transactions are frequently marketed through platforms (CBRE MHC, Newmark, Eastdil) with pre-negotiated commission structures. Verify alignment.
- **Data Center:** Data center brokers frequently claim entitlement to commissions on follow-on transactions (expansions, renewals). Ensure the brokerage provision addresses the scope of the engagement.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Real estate brokers in New York must be licensed under the New York Real Property Law. An unlicensed broker cannot enforce a commission claim. Verify licensure.
- **California:** California Business and Professions Code Section 10136 requires a written listing agreement for a broker to collect a commission. Oral brokerage agreements are unenforceable.
- **Texas:** Texas Property Code Section 62.004 similarly requires written agreements. No oral commission claims.
- **Illinois:** Illinois Real Estate License Act requires licensure and generally requires written agreements for commercial transactions.

## Escrow Agent Provisions

### Preferred Position

Buyer's primary interest in the escrow provisions is to ensure that: (1) the Deposit is held by a neutral, creditworthy escrow agent (typically the title company, not Seller's attorney); (2) the Deposit earns interest for Buyer's benefit; (3) the escrow agent has clear instructions for disbursement upon termination; and (4) the escrow agent's interpleader rights and liability limitations do not prejudice Buyer's ability to recover the Deposit promptly if the agreement is terminated.

**Preferred structure (synthesized from the Detailed Seller Form, Section 11.21, and UNICO forms):**

The escrow provision should address:

1. **Escrow agent identity:** Title company selected by Buyer, not Seller's counsel (per NY Checklist: "Negotiate that the escrow agent is the purchaser's title insurance company; and not the seller's attorney").
2. **Investment of Deposit:** In an interest-bearing account selected or approved by Buyer (Detailed Seller Form, Section 11.21(f): "All deposits into the escrow shall be held by the Escrow Agent in an interest bearing account selected by or approved by Purchaser").
3. **Interest allocation:** All interest accrues to Buyer except when Deposit becomes payable to Seller as liquidated damages.
4. **Disbursement instructions:** Clear, self-executing instructions for return of Deposit upon termination events.
5. **Interpleader right:** Escrow agent may file an interpleader action if the parties dispute disbursement.
6. **Liability limitation:** Escrow agent not liable except for negligence or willful misconduct.
7. **Indemnification:** Mutual indemnification of escrow agent by both Seller and Buyer (unless escrow agent is negligent or guilty of willful misconduct).

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the escrow agent is obligated to disburse the Deposit to Buyer promptly upon Buyer's delivery of a termination notice that satisfies the contractual requirements. Avoid language that requires "mutual written instructions" or "joint direction" for any disbursement -- this gives Seller a unilateral veto over return of the Deposit.
- Negotiate a "deemed consent" mechanism: if one party delivers disbursement instructions to the escrow agent with a copy to the other party, and the other party does not object within 5 Business Days, the escrow agent may disburse accordingly.
- The Detailed Seller Form (Section 11.21(d)) provides that if the parties disagree, the escrow agent "may hold the Deposit until the receipt of written instructions from both Purchaser and Seller or a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction." Buyer should resist this "hold until agreement" formulation and insist on the interpleader mechanism instead (Section 11.21(d) also permits interpleader).
- Confirm that the escrow agent's acknowledgment at the end of the agreement evidences its acceptance of all escrow obligations, including IRS reporting obligations (UNICO forms, Acknowledgment of Escrow Agent section).
- Buyer should resist any provision that allows the escrow agent to resign without providing a successor escrow agent acceptable to both parties.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Escrow agent should require mutual instructions for all disbursements to protect against wrongful release of the Deposit. Seller may also insist on its own title company or attorney as escrow agent.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Accept mutual instruction requirement for contested disbursements, but with a mandatory interpleader obligation (not merely permissive) if the parties do not agree within 10 Business Days.
2. **Second fallback:** Accept Seller's title company as escrow agent if Buyer's title company issues the title policy (split functions).
3. **Third fallback:** Accept a "notice and objection" mechanism where the party requesting disbursement sends a notice to escrow agent and the other party, and disbursement occurs unless the other party delivers a written objection within 5 Business Days.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE TO HIGH** -- The escrow provisions become critical when a deal terminates and the parties dispute entitlement to the Deposit. In institutional transactions, the Deposit can be $2M-$10M+. The difference between a provision that allows prompt return upon termination notice vs. one that requires mutual written instructions can result in months or years of delay and litigation.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations. Escrow provisions are structural and apply uniformly across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Escrow agents in New York must comply with the Interest on Lawyer Account (IOLA) rules if the escrow agent is an attorney. Title company escrow is generally preferable.
- **California:** California escrow law (Financial Code Sections 17000-17702) regulates escrow agents. Title companies acting as escrow agents are exempt from these regulations but subject to Insurance Code oversight.
- **Texas:** Texas does not have a separate escrow licensing regime. Title companies routinely serve as escrow agents.
- **Colorado/Massachusetts:** Same general principles apply; title company escrow is standard.

## Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Venue

### Preferred Position

Buyer should insist that the agreement is governed by the law of the state where the Property is located, without regard to conflicts-of-law principles. This is the universal standard in commercial real estate PSAs and is non-negotiable in virtually all institutional transactions. Venue should be in the state and county where the Property is located, with concurrent jurisdiction in the applicable federal district court.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.8):**

> This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state in which the Property is located, without regard to any otherwise applicable principles of conflicts of laws. Venue for any action arising out of this Agreement shall be in the state courts in the state and county in which the Property is located, or in U.S. Federal District Court for the applicable district in which the Property is located.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Always include the "without regard to conflicts of laws" qualifier. Without it, a court could apply the choice-of-law rules of the governing state and end up applying a different state's substantive law.
- In portfolio transactions involving properties in multiple states, designate one state's law as governing the PSA itself, while acknowledging that local law governs title, recording, transfer taxes, and property-specific matters.
- Include both state court and federal court as acceptable venues. Federal court may be preferable for complex disputes involving diverse citizenship.
- The Detailed Seller Form (Section 11.5) uses a different jurisdiction/venue approach -- specifying Colorado courts and the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado regardless of property location. This is a seller-favorable provision (forum selection to seller's home jurisdiction) and should be resisted.
- Consider whether the agreement should include a consent-to-jurisdiction clause and a waiver of inconvenient-forum objections (the Detailed Seller Form, Section 11.5(c)(iii) includes such waivers). Buyer should accept these only if the venue is the Property jurisdiction, not Seller's home jurisdiction.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Governing law and venue should be Seller's home state (e.g., if Seller is a Colorado-based fund, Colorado law and Denver venue). This is common in institutional seller forms.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Reject seller's home-state law entirely. Property-state law is the overwhelming market standard and any deviation creates uncertainty about the enforceability of property-specific provisions (recording requirements, transfer taxes, title insurance, tenant rights).
2. **Second fallback:** If Seller insists on its home-state venue for "convenience," accept a provision permitting either party to file in either the Property-state courts or Seller's home-state courts, with the first-filed action controlling.
3. **Last resort:** Accept Seller's home-state venue but only if governing law remains the law of the Property state.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW TO MODERATE** -- This is generally a settled provision in institutional transactions. The risk increases when the seller inserts its home-state governing law, which can create ambiguity about the application of property-specific statutes (homestead, recording, transfer tax, commercial lease laws).

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Portfolio (multi-state):** In multi-state portfolio deals, a single governing law (typically the state with the greatest asset concentration or the state where the buyer is based) is applied to the PSA, with carve-outs for local law on title, recording, and property-specific matters.
- **Data Center:** Data center transactions may involve regulatory considerations (CFIUS, export controls) that implicate federal law. Consider whether the governing-law clause should acknowledge the application of federal law where applicable.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** New York General Obligations Law Section 5-1401 permits parties to a contract involving at least $250,000 to select New York law regardless of any connection to the state. Section 5-1402 permits consent to New York jurisdiction for contracts of $1M+. These provisions make New York a common choice for governing law in multi-state deals.
- **Delaware:** Similar to New York, Delaware is frequently selected as governing law for entity-level transactions.
- **California:** California courts may refuse to enforce a choice-of-law provision if California has a materially greater interest in the transaction. For California properties, always use California law.

---

## Jury Trial Waiver

### Preferred Position

Buyer should include a mutual, broad jury trial waiver covering all claims arising under or related to the agreement. Jury trial waivers are standard in institutional commercial real estate transactions and benefit both parties by reducing litigation risk and unpredictability.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.9):**

> EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO OR THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE.

Key elements:
- ALL CAPS formatting, which is required in some jurisdictions for enforceability.
- Broad scope covering contract, tort, and all related instruments.
- Acknowledgment that the provision was negotiated at arm's length with the benefit of counsel (the UNICO language includes this).

### Key Negotiation Points

- This is typically a non-controversial provision. Both institutional buyers and sellers benefit from bench trials over jury trials.
- Ensure the waiver covers claims "in any way connected with or related or incidental to" the agreement -- not just claims "arising under" the agreement. The broader formulation prevents a party from circumventing the waiver by characterizing a claim as a tort rather than a contract dispute.
- The Detailed Seller Form (Section 11.5) includes the jury waiver within the governing law section, which is acceptable structurally.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Pushback on this provision is rare in institutional transactions. If a counterparty resists, it may indicate unsophisticated counsel or a litigious posture -- either is a red flag.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- Standard provision. The primary risk is omission rather than adverse drafting.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **California:** Jury trial waivers in pre-dispute agreements are unenforceable in California under California Constitution Article I, Section 16, and Grafton Partners v. Superior Court (2005). For California properties, this provision will not be enforced. Consider an alternative dispute resolution mechanism (e.g., judicial reference under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 638).
- **Georgia:** Georgia courts have been reluctant to enforce pre-dispute jury trial waivers. Use caution.
- **New York:** Enforceable if knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made. The acknowledgment language in the UNICO form (negotiated at arm's length with benefit of counsel) supports enforceability.
- **Texas:** Generally enforceable in commercial transactions between sophisticated parties.
- **Federal courts:** Enforceable in most federal circuits for commercial transactions.

---

## Entire Agreement / Merger Clause

### Preferred Position

Buyer should insist on a comprehensive merger clause that expressly supersedes all prior agreements, including any previously executed letter of intent (LOI), early access agreement, and non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement (NDA). This protects the buyer from seller claims that oral promises or prior written agreements create obligations beyond the four corners of the PSA.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.16):**

> This Agreement (including any and all exhibits and/or schedules attached hereto) and any other document to be furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof embody the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto as to the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings other than those expressly set forth or referred to in such documents. This Agreement and such documents supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the parties and/or their affiliates with respect to the subject matter hereof (including, without limitation, any previously executed letters of intent, early access agreements and/or non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements).

### Key Negotiation Points

- Expressly list the types of prior agreements being superseded: LOIs, NDAs, early access agreements, term sheets. The UNICO forms include this enumeration.
- Ensure the merger clause references "exhibits and schedules" so that the attached forms and schedules are part of the integrated agreement.
- Verify consistency with the confidentiality provision -- if the confidentiality section supersedes the prior NDA (as in UNICO Seller Side, Section 14.5), the merger clause should not independently purport to terminate the NDA's obligations without the replacement confidentiality terms taking effect.
- The Detailed Seller Form (Section 11.1) uses a more concise formulation: "This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated herein, and it supersedes all prior discussions, understandings or agreements between the parties." This is adequate but the UNICO version is more protective because it enumerates specific superseded documents.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

This is generally non-controversial. If Seller resists inclusion of specific superseded documents (e.g., wants the NDA to survive), negotiate within the confidentiality provision rather than weakening the merger clause.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- Standard boilerplate. The risk is primarily in omission or in failing to enumerate specific prior agreements that should be superseded.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** New York General Obligations Law Section 15-301 provides that a properly drafted merger clause will prevent a party from introducing extrinsic evidence to vary the terms of the written agreement. This statutory backstop makes New York one of the most favorable jurisdictions for merger clauses.
- **California:** California courts apply the parol evidence rule (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. Section 1856) but may still consider extrinsic evidence to determine the meaning of ambiguous terms.

---

## Amendments (Written Only)

### Preferred Position

All amendments, modifications, and supplements to the agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties. No oral modifications. No modifications by course of conduct.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.19):**

> This Agreement may only be amended, modified or supplemented by a written agreement signed by Buyer and Seller.

The Detailed Seller Form (Section 11.10) adds a useful qualifier: the written agreement must "expressly state that it is intended to amend this Agreement." This is a stronger formulation that prevents inadvertent amendments through side letters or emails.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Consider adopting the Detailed Seller Form's requirement that amendments must "expressly state" their intent to amend. This prevents a party from arguing that an informal email exchange constitutes an amendment.
- Confirm that the amendment provision does not conflict with the notice provision -- i.e., email notice is valid for notices but not for amendments.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

This is universally accepted boilerplate. No pushback expected.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- Standard provision.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- All U.S. jurisdictions enforce written-amendment provisions for commercial real estate contracts.
- **New York:** Strongly enforceable under N.Y. General Obligations Law Section 15-301.

---

## No Recording of Agreement

### Preferred Position

Buyer should accept a mutual prohibition on recording a memorandum of the agreement. While in some contexts a buyer might want to record a memorandum to protect its equitable interest (e.g., against a subsequent sale to a third party), in institutional transactions this is not standard practice and recording can create title clouds that complicate the transaction for both parties.

**Standard language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.11):**

> Buyer shall not record any memorandum disclosing this Agreement.

Note that this is a unilateral obligation of Buyer. The Detailed Seller Form (Section 11.18) goes further and includes: (1) a termination right for Seller if Buyer breaches; (2) forfeiture of Deposit as liquidated damages; and (3) an irrevocable power of attorney from Buyer to Seller to execute and record documents terminating any wrongful recording. This is the most aggressive no-recording provision in the precedent set.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Accept the basic no-recording obligation but resist the Detailed Seller Form's power-of-attorney provision, which is seller-overreach.
- Resist any provision that makes a breach of the no-recording obligation a material default entitling Seller to terminate and retain the Deposit.
- If Buyer needs protection against a double-sale by Seller, consider negotiating a pre-Closing escrow instruction to the title company requiring notice to Buyer of any other pending transaction affecting the property, rather than recording a memorandum.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Recording a memorandum creates a title cloud that can survive termination and impede Seller's ability to sell the property to a backup buyer. Seller may insist on the power-of-attorney remedy.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Accept the no-recording obligation with a cure right -- Buyer must remove any wrongful recording within 3 Business Days of notice.
2. **Second fallback:** Accept that a wrongful recording constitutes a default, but with a right to cure before Seller can terminate or retain the Deposit.
3. **Last resort:** Accept the power of attorney as a remedy for wrongful recording only, limited to removing the specific recorded instrument.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- This is standard in institutional transactions. Buyers rarely have reason to record a memorandum.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- All jurisdictions permit recording of memoranda of contract, but the no-recording provision contractually waives this right.
- **New York:** Lis pendens (CPLR 6501) is available as an alternative to a memorandum of contract if Buyer needs to protect its interest in the context of litigation.

---

## Time of the Essence

### Preferred Position

Buyer should accept a general "time is of the essence" clause but ensure it is coupled with adequate cure periods for non-monetary defaults and clear Business Day extension mechanisms. A bald "time is of the essence" clause without cure periods can make every deadline a drop-dead date, exposing Buyer to forfeiture of the Deposit for minor timing failures.

**Acceptable language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.2):**

> Time is of the essence in the performance of all obligations under this Agreement.

This should be read in conjunction with the Business Day definition and the time-computation rules in the same section.

**More aggressive (seller-favorable) language to resist (from the Detailed Seller Form, Section 11.14):**

> Time is of the essence of this Agreement and all covenants and deadlines hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser and Seller hereby confirm their intention and agreement that time shall be of the essence of each and every provision of this Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent modification or extension of any date or time period... The agreement that time is of the essence may only be modified or waived by the express written agreement of Purchaser and Seller...

This language is intentionally designed to prevent any argument that time-of-the-essence was implicitly waived by course of conduct (e.g., by accepting late performance). Buyer should resist this super-charged formulation because it eliminates equitable defenses.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Accept the general "time is of the essence" clause but ensure that critical buyer deadlines (diligence period, title objection period, Closing) have adequate business-day extension mechanisms.
- The Meadows form (Section 9.9) includes a business-day computation rule: "the day of the act or event from which the period of time runs shall be excluded, and the last day of such period shall be included, unless it is not a [Business Day], in which case the period shall be deemed to run until the end of the next day which is a [Business Day]." Ensure this or equivalent language is included.
- Resist language that time of the essence "may only be modified or waived by express written agreement" -- this prevents Buyer from arguing that Seller's acceptance of late performance constituted a waiver.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Time is of the essence is non-negotiable and must apply without exception. This is generally accepted in institutional transactions.

**Fallback:** Accept the standard clause but negotiate adequate cure periods in the default provision (typically 5 Business Days for monetary defaults and 10-30 days for non-monetary defaults with diligent pursuit extensions).

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** -- The interaction between "time is of the essence" and specific deadline provisions (diligence period, Closing date, cure periods) can create traps. Ensure each critical deadline section has its own extension mechanism.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** New York courts strictly enforce time-of-the-essence clauses, particularly after a party has given a "time of the essence" letter setting a law day for Closing. A failure to close on the law day is treated as a material breach.
- **California:** California courts are somewhat more willing to consider equitable defenses (waiver, estoppel) even in the presence of a time-of-the-essence clause.

---

## Severability

### Preferred Position

Standard severability clause providing that if any provision is found invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect. Buyer should ensure the clause also provides that the invalid provision will be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable while preserving the parties' economic intent.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.17):**

> Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement, or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement.

The Detailed Seller Form (Section 11.17) adds a useful "reformation" concept: "such provision shall be given force and effect to the fullest possible extent." This is the stronger formulation.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the clause includes the "as to such jurisdiction" qualifier for multi-jurisdictional portfolio transactions, so that a ruling in one state does not affect the provision's enforceability in another.
- Standard boilerplate -- minimal negotiation expected.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

No material pushback expected. This is universally accepted boilerplate.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- Standard provision.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Universally enforced across U.S. jurisdictions.

---

## Further Assurances

### Preferred Position

Include a mutual obligation for each party to execute and deliver additional documents reasonably necessary to accomplish the intent of the agreement. This is particularly important for Buyer because post-Closing issues frequently require Seller's cooperation (e.g., corrective deeds, estoppel responses to Buyer's lender, assignment consents, tax appeals).

**Preferred language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.20):**

> Each party, at the request of the other, shall execute, acknowledge or have notarized (if appropriate) and deliver in a timely manner such additional documents, and do such other additional acts, also in a timely manner, as may be reasonably required in order to accomplish the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the obligation survives Closing. Without survival language, Seller may argue it has no post-Closing obligation to cooperate.
- Add a cost-allocation provision: the requesting party bears the cost of preparation, the executing party bears no out-of-pocket cost.
- The Meadows form (Section 9.6) uses slightly different language ("from and after the Effective Date") that makes the obligation effective from signing, not just at Closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Minimal pushback expected. Seller may request that the obligation be limited to actions that do not impose material additional liability or cost.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- Standard provision, but its absence can create complications when post-Closing corrective documents are needed.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Portfolio transactions:** Further-assurances obligations are particularly important when conveying multiple properties through multiple deeds and assignments.
- **Data Center:** May require post-Closing cooperation for utility transfer applications, interconnection agreements, and regulatory filings.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Universally enforceable. Some jurisdictions (e.g., California) have statutory further-assurances obligations for real property conveyances.

---

## Counterparts and Electronic Signatures

### Preferred Position

The agreement should be executable in counterparts with electronic signatures (including DocuSign, AdobeSign, and PDF/email signatures) having the same legal effect as original ink signatures. This is standard in modern institutional transactions.

**Preferred language (synthesized from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.22, and Meadows, Section 9.10):**

> This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute the same agreement. The words "execution," "signed" and "signature" and words of like import in this Agreement shall include images of manually executed signatures transmitted by electronic format (including ".pdf", ".tif" or ".jpg") and other electronic signatures (including DocuSign and AdobeSign). The use of electronic signatures and electronic records shall be of the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a manually executed signature to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, any state law based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, and the Uniform Commercial Code.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the electronic signature provision references both federal (E-SIGN Act) and state (UETA) electronic signature laws.
- Confirm that the provision covers not just the PSA itself but all "instruments, documents or agreements executed or delivered in connection herewith."
- The Detailed Seller Form (Section 11.20) includes a reciprocal obligation to deliver originals "promptly" after electronic execution "but a failure to do so shall not affect the enforceability." This is a helpful clarification.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

No material pushback expected. Electronic signatures are universally accepted in institutional commercial real estate.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- Standard provision.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- All 50 U.S. states have adopted some version of the UETA or equivalent legislation permitting electronic signatures in commercial transactions.
- **New York:** The Electronic Signatures and Records Act (ESRA) governs. Enforceable for commercial real estate.
- **Illinois:** Illinois Electronic Commerce Security Act provides an additional framework.
- Note: Certain documents delivered at Closing (deeds, transfer tax returns, affidavits) may require notarization. Remote online notarization (RON) is now permitted in the majority of U.S. states.

---

## No Third-Party Beneficiaries

### Preferred Position

The agreement should expressly disclaim any intent to benefit third parties or create third-party beneficiary rights.

**Standard language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.14):**

> Nothing in this Agreement is intended to benefit any third party or create any third party beneficiary.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure this provision does not conflict with any indemnification obligations that may extend benefits to third parties (e.g., Buyer's lender, Buyer's Affiliates).
- Verify that the provision does not inadvertently negate the rights of assignees or successors, which should be addressed separately in the assignment and successors-and-assigns provisions.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

No pushback expected. This is universally accepted boilerplate.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- Standard provision.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Universally enforceable.

---

## Construction / Interpretation (No Rule of Construction Against Drafter)

### Preferred Position

Include a mutual acknowledgment that both parties contributed to drafting the agreement and that ambiguities will not be construed against either party.

**Preferred language (from Meadows, Section 9.4):**

> Seller and Buyer acknowledge that each party and its counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and that the rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement or any document executed and delivered by either party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The Detailed Seller Form (Section 11.15) contains essentially identical language: "This Agreement shall not be construed more strictly against one party than against the other merely by virtue of the fact that it may have been prepared primarily by counsel for one of the parties."

### Key Negotiation Points

- This is important when Buyer is reviewing a Seller-drafted form. Without this clause, any ambiguities in Seller's form would be construed in Buyer's favor (contra proferentem). The clause eliminates this advantage but is considered standard in institutional transactions because both parties' counsel typically negotiate the document extensively.
- Include related interpretive rules (from Meadows, Section 9.5): singular/plural interchangeability, "include/including" means "without limitation," "approval/consent/notice" means "written approval/consent/notice."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

No pushback expected. This benefits whichever party drafted the initial form.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- Standard provision. Note that by accepting this clause on a seller-drafted form, Buyer gives up the contra proferentem rule, which could otherwise be a powerful interpretive tool.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Universally applied and enforced. The contra proferentem rule is a common-law default that parties can contractually waive.

---

## Exculpation / Limited Liability (No Personal Liability)

### Preferred Position

Buyer should accept a mutual exculpation provision that shields the individuals behind both parties (members, managers, officers, directors, employees, agents) from personal liability under the agreement. However, Buyer must carefully limit the scope of the seller-side exculpation to avoid eliminating recourse entirely.

**Acceptable mutual language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.12):**

> Neither the members, managers, employees or agents of Seller, nor the shareholders, officers, directors, employees or agents of any of them, shall be liable under this Agreement and all parties hereto shall look solely to the assets of Seller for the payment of any claim or the performance of any obligation by Seller. None of the individual members, managers, employees or agents of Buyer, nor the shareholders, officers, directors, partners, members, employees or agents of any of them, shall be liable under this Agreement.

The Meadows form (Section 9.11, "Exculpation") includes similar language but also adds that Buyer "hereby [waives] any and all such personal liability" -- this is a broader waiver that buyer should ensure applies symmetrically.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The critical issue from the buyer's perspective is the "look solely to the assets of Seller" formulation. This means that if Seller is a single-purpose entity (SPE) that distributes all sale proceeds to its members immediately after Closing, Buyer may have no practical recourse for post-Closing claims (rep breaches, proration adjustments, indemnification obligations).
- **Negotiate that "assets of Seller" includes the net proceeds of the sale received by Seller, not just assets remaining in the entity.** The Detailed Seller Form (Section 11.16(a)) includes this critical language: "following the Closing, [recourse limited] to the net proceeds of the sale of the Property actually received by Seller."
- The Detailed Seller Form (Section 11.16(a)) also states: "no negative capital account or any contribution or payment obligation of any partner or member of Seller shall constitute an asset of Seller." This eliminates any argument that Buyer can reach through the entity to the individuals. Buyer should resist this formulation or negotiate a post-Closing holdback or rep-and-warranty escrow to ensure a source of recovery.
- Negotiate for a "no-dissolution" covenant -- Seller may not dissolve or wind up the entity for an agreed period after Closing (the NY Checklist suggests 6 months to 1 year).
- Consider whether to negotiate a guaranty from Seller's parent entity or sponsor of Seller's post-Closing obligations (rep-and-warranty indemnities, proration true-ups, tenant-related obligations).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** SPE sellers are standard in institutional transactions and Buyer should look to the rep-and-warranty survival period and claim cap rather than attempting to pierce the SPE.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Accept the limited-liability provision but negotiate a post-Closing escrow holdback (typically 1-3% of purchase price) to secure Seller's post-Closing obligations for the rep-and-warranty survival period.
2. **Second fallback:** Accept the provision but obtain a guaranty from Seller's parent entity or fund-level entity, limited to Seller's post-Closing indemnification obligations.
3. **Third fallback:** Accept the provision but negotiate that Seller may not dissolve or distribute all proceeds for 12 months post-Closing (or such longer period as the rep-and-warranty survival period).
4. **Last resort:** Accept the provision as drafted but negotiate a higher claim cap or longer rep-and-warranty survival period to compensate for the limited recourse.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** -- This is one of the most important provisions from the buyer's perspective. An aggressive exculpation clause combined with a short rep-and-warranty survival period and a low claim cap can render Buyer's post-Closing remedies essentially worthless. The Detailed Seller Form's approach (recourse limited to net proceeds, no capital account clawback, 1% claim cap, 6-month survival) is the most aggressive seller position in the precedent set.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The concern is structural, not asset-type specific. However, the magnitude of post-Closing risk varies by asset type:
  - **Office and Retail (multi-tenant):** Higher proration-adjustment and tenant-reconciliation risk, making post-Closing recourse more important.
  - **Industrial (NNN):** Lower post-Closing adjustment risk, so limited recourse is less concerning.
  - **Multifamily:** Operating expense reconciliations and security deposit obligations create post-Closing exposure.
  - **Data Center:** Complex tenant relationships and infrastructure warranties may generate post-Closing claims.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Delaware:** Most institutional SPEs are formed in Delaware. Delaware LLC Act Section 18-303 provides broad statutory protection against member liability, which the contractual exculpation reinforces.
- **New York:** New York courts will enforce contractual exculpation provisions but may permit piercing-the-veil claims in cases of fraud.
- **Texas:** Texas Business Organizations Code provides similar SPE protections.

---

## Joint and Several Liability

### Preferred Position

Where there are multiple Seller entities (portfolio transactions, TIC structures), Buyer should insist that all Seller entities be jointly and severally liable for all obligations under the agreement, including post-Closing indemnification obligations. This prevents a Seller entity from arguing that its liability is limited to the specific property it sold.

Where there are multiple Buyer entities (TIC or JV structures), Buyer should resist joint-and-several liability and instead insist on several (proportionate) liability based on each entity's ownership interest.

### Key Negotiation Points

- In portfolio transactions with multiple Seller entities, joint-and-several liability is critical because post-Closing claims may relate to shared infrastructure, common-area obligations, or portfolio-level representations.
- If Buyer assigns the agreement to an Affiliate or TIC structure, Seller will insist that the original Buyer remain liable (see UNICO forms, Section 16.6: "No assignment by Buyer shall release it from any liability hereunder"). This is acceptable but Buyer should negotiate that the assignee's liability is limited to its proportionate interest.
- In the Detailed Seller Form (Section 11.3), Seller requires that any assignee become "jointly and severally liable with Purchaser for all such obligations." Buyer should accept this for the assignee but negotiate that the original Buyer's liability terminates upon assignment to a controlled Affiliate.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** If Buyer assigns to a thinly capitalized Affiliate, Seller needs the original Buyer's credit behind the deal.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Accept that original Buyer remains liable but only for obligations that accrue before or as of Closing (not indefinite post-Closing liability).
2. **Second fallback:** Accept joint-and-several liability of Buyer and its assignee, but with the understanding that Seller must exhaust claims against the assignee (the entity that took title) before proceeding against the original Buyer.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** -- Primarily relevant in portfolio and TIC transactions.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Portfolio (multi-property):** Joint-and-several liability of multiple Sellers is most critical here.
- **TIC structures:** Where Buyer is acquiring through a TIC, the allocation of liability among co-tenants must be addressed.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Joint-and-several liability is enforceable in all U.S. jurisdictions for contractual obligations.

---

## Business Day Definition

### Preferred Position

The Business Day definition should include all standard federal holidays and the state holidays of the Property state. The UNICO forms use a clean definition tied to both Washington State holidays and the state in which the Property is located.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.2):**

> "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday, or any day that is recognized as a holiday in Washington State or in the state in which the Property is located.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Include the time-computation rule in the same section: exclude the first day, include the last day, extend to the next Business Day if the last day falls on a non-Business Day or on a day when the county recording office is closed.
- Specify the cutoff time (typically 5:00 p.m. local time of the Property) for actions required on a Business Day (see Meadows, Section 9.12).
- For portfolio transactions spanning multiple time zones, designate one controlling time zone.
- Consider adding "or any day on which national banking institutions are closed" to capture bank-specific closures (e.g., Juneteenth before it was universally adopted).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Minimal pushback expected. The definition is mechanical.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- But errors in the Business Day definition or time-computation rules can cause missed deadlines, which are catastrophic in a "time is of the essence" agreement.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- State-specific holidays vary. For example, Oregon includes Indigenous Peoples' Day; Washington includes Presidents' Day (state offices closed). Ensure the definition captures relevant state closures.
- **New York:** NYC has extensive banking holidays. Consider "days on which commercial banks in New York City are open for business" formulation for NY deals.

---

## Force Majeure

### Preferred Position

Buyer should negotiate for a force majeure provision that excuses delays in performance (but not payment obligations) caused by events beyond the parties' reasonable control. In institutional PSAs without financing contingencies, force majeure is particularly important because Buyer has no other mechanism to extend Closing if external events (natural disasters, government shutdowns, pandemics, wars, title company or recording office closures) prevent timely performance.

**Preferred language elements:**

> Neither party shall be deemed in default of this Agreement to the extent that any delay or failure in performance results from Force Majeure Events, which shall include: acts of God, fire, flood, earthquake, epidemic, pandemic, quarantine restrictions, war, terrorism, labor disputes, strikes, government orders or restrictions, failure of utilities, inability to obtain materials or services, or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of the affected party. The affected party must provide prompt notice of the Force Majeure Event and its expected duration. The Closing Date and all other deadlines shall be extended day-for-day during the continuance of a Force Majeure Event, but in no event for more than [60/90] days. Force majeure shall not excuse any obligation to make monetary payments when due.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Many institutional PSAs do not include a force majeure provision at all. The UNICO forms, Meadows form, and Detailed Seller Form all omit force majeure. Buyer should advocate for inclusion, particularly in a post-pandemic market.
- If a standalone force majeure clause is rejected, negotiate for specific extensions tied to recording-office closures, title-company delays, and government shutdowns.
- Ensure the force majeure clause does not excuse Seller's obligation to deliver clear title or cure title objections.
- Cap the extension period (e.g., 60 or 90 days) with a right for either party to terminate if the force majeure event continues beyond the cap.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Force majeure clauses create uncertainty about the Closing Date and are disfavored in institutional transactions where both parties are expected to perform regardless of external events.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Limit force majeure to events that physically prevent Closing (recording office closure, government-mandated shutdown) rather than broader commercial-impracticability events.
2. **Second fallback:** Include force majeure only for the Closing Date, not for pre-Closing deadlines (diligence period, title objection period).
3. **Last resort:** Omit force majeure but negotiate a mutual right to extend the Closing Date by up to 30 days upon written notice if recording offices or escrow agents are unable to function.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** -- The absence of a force majeure clause in a "time is of the essence" agreement means that no external event (short of impossibility under common law) excuses a failure to close on the scheduled date. This became a real issue during COVID-19 when recording offices and banks shut down, trapping parties in PSAs with immovable Closing dates.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The concern is structural. However, certain asset types face additional force majeure risks:
  - **Industrial (port-adjacent):** Port closures, labor strikes.
  - **Data Center:** Power grid failures, utility moratoriums.
  - **Retail (tourist markets):** Travel restrictions, government-mandated closures.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** New York courts interpret force majeure clauses narrowly and generally require the specific event to be enumerated. A generic catch-all may be insufficient.
- **California:** California courts apply impossibility/impracticability doctrines more liberally than New York.
- **Texas:** Texas courts enforce force majeure clauses as written but also require the event to be beyond the party's control and not caused by the party's negligence.
- **Florida:** Post-hurricane force majeure provisions are common in Florida PSAs.

---

## IRS Reporting (Section 6045(e))

### Preferred Position

Designate the Escrow Agent as the "Reporting Person" responsible for all IRS information reporting under Section 6045(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, including filing Form 1099-S. Both parties must provide their taxpayer identification numbers and W-9 forms.

**Standard language (from the Detailed Seller Form, Section 11.9):**

> Purchaser and Seller hereby agree that the Escrow Agent shall act as "the person responsible for closing" the transaction which is the subject of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6045(e) of the Code and shall prepare and file all informational returns, including IRS Form 1099-S, and shall otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 6045(e) of the Code.

The UNICO forms (Section 11.12) provide more detail, including: (a) W-9 requirements, (b) taxpayer identification number certification, and (c) a 4-year document retention obligation.

### Key Negotiation Points

- This is standard boilerplate. The key issue is ensuring Escrow Agent agrees to serve as Reporting Person (the UNICO forms condition this on Escrow Agent's execution of the agreement).
- If Escrow Agent refuses, the parties must agree on an alternative third-party Reporting Person (see UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.12.1).
- This provision should survive Closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

No pushback expected.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- Regulatory compliance provision.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Federal law applies uniformly.

---

## No Implied Agreement

### Preferred Position

Include a provision confirming that no contract arises until the agreement is fully executed by both parties, and that the exchange of drafts, correspondence, or oral discussions does not create binding obligations.

**Preferred language (from the Detailed Seller Form, Section 11.19):**

> Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall have any obligations in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement unless both Seller and Purchaser, each acting in its sole discretion, elects to execute and deliver this Agreement to the other party. No correspondence, course of dealing or submission of drafts or final versions of this Agreement between Seller and Purchaser shall be deemed to create any binding obligations... Once executed and delivered by Seller and Purchaser, this Agreement shall be binding upon them notwithstanding the failure of Escrow Agent or any broker or other Person to execute this Agreement.

The UNICO forms include similar language (Section 16.21: "Presentation of any draft of this Agreement by one party to the other shall not be deemed an offer").

### Key Negotiation Points

- This is important in institutional transactions where multiple drafts are exchanged over weeks or months. Without this clause, Seller could argue that Buyer's acceptance of a term sheet or LOI created a binding obligation.
- Ensure the provision confirms that the agreement is binding even without Escrow Agent's or broker's signature.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

No pushback expected.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- Standard provision.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** New York statute of frauds (General Obligations Law Section 5-703) requires a signed writing for real property contracts. The no-implied-agreement provision reinforces this.
- **California:** California statute of frauds (Civil Code Section 1624) similarly requires a signed writing.

---

## Limitation on Liability of Seller Post-Closing (Look-to-Entity-Only)

### Preferred Position

This is closely related to the Exculpation provision above but addresses the specific limitation on the dollar amount and duration of Seller's post-Closing liability. The Buyer should negotiate to maximize the claim cap, extend the survival period, and ensure there is an identifiable source of recovery (escrow holdback, guaranty, or undistributed proceeds).

**Key provisions from the Detailed Seller Form (Section 10.4 and 11.16):**

The most aggressive seller position includes:
- Claim cap: 1% of Purchase Price (the "Claim Cap").
- Survival period: 6 months post-Closing.
- Basket/deductible: $100,000 threshold before any claim is actionable.
- No consequential, incidental, indirect, punitive, special, or exemplary damages.
- Purchaser must exhaust insurance, lease, and contract remedies before claiming against Seller.
- Recourse limited to Seller's interest in the Property (pre-Closing) or net proceeds (post-Closing).
- No negative capital accounts or contribution obligations constitute Seller assets.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Claim cap:** Negotiate for 2-5% of Purchase Price rather than the 1% floor in the Detailed Seller Form.
- **Survival period:** Negotiate for 12-18 months rather than the 6-month period in the Detailed Seller Form. For environmental representations, negotiate 24-36 months or until statute-of-limitations expiration.
- **Basket/deductible:** Reduce from $100,000 to $25,000-$50,000 for a $50M+ transaction, or eliminate entirely with a "tipping basket" (once the threshold is met, the full amount is recoverable, not just the excess).
- **Exhaustion requirement:** Resist the requirement to seek recovery under insurance and leases before claiming against Seller. At most, accept a provision allowing Seller a credit for amounts actually recovered from third parties.
- **No-dissolution covenant:** Negotiate that Seller will not dissolve or distribute all net proceeds for the duration of the survival period.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

(See the fallback chain under Exculpation / Limited Liability above, which addresses the same economic issues.)

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** -- The combination of a low claim cap, short survival period, high basket, and exhaustion requirement can effectively eliminate Buyer's post-Closing remedies. This is the single most important economic negotiation in the miscellaneous provisions.

### Asset-Type Variations

- See Exculpation section above.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- See Exculpation section above.

---

## Statutory Disclaimers

### Preferred Position

Certain states require specific statutory disclaimers in real property transfer documents. Buyer should ensure compliance with all applicable statutory disclaimer requirements but should resist any attempt by Seller to use statutory disclaimers as a basis for expanding contractual disclaimers beyond what the statute requires.

**Example: Oregon (from Meadows form, Section 9.13):**

> THE PROPERTY DESCRIBED IN THIS INSTRUMENT MAY NOT BE WITHIN A FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT PROTECTING STRUCTURES. THE PROPERTY IS SUBJECT TO LAND USE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT, IN FARM OR FOREST ZONES, MAY NOT AUTHORIZE CONSTRUCTION OR SITING OF A RESIDENCE AND THAT LIMIT LAWSUITS AGAINST FARMING OR FOREST PRACTICES, AS DEFINED IN ORS 30.930, IN ALL ZONES. BEFORE SIGNING OR ACCEPTING THIS INSTRUMENT, THE PERSON TRANSFERRING FEE TITLE SHOULD INQUIRE ABOUT THE PERSON'S RIGHTS, IF ANY, UNDER ORS 195.300, 195.301 AND 195.305 TO 195.336...

**Example: Washington (from income property seller form, Section 32):**

> PURSUANT TO RCW CH. 64.06, AS AMENDED, BUYER HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE SELLER DISCLOSURE STATEMENT REFERRED TO THEREIN. THIS WAIVER DOES NOT EXTEND TO THE SECTION OF THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT ENTITLED "ENVIRONMENTAL."

### Key Negotiation Points

- In commercial transactions, statutory seller disclosure requirements are frequently waived (as in the Washington example above). Buyer should confirm that any waiver of the seller disclosure statement does not waive the environmental section.
- For Oregon properties, the ORS land-use disclaimer is required in all transfer instruments, including the PSA and the deed. Ensure it appears in both.
- Verify that the statutory disclaimers are the current versions, as legislatures periodically amend these requirements.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Statutory disclaimers are mandatory and non-negotiable. The only negotiation is around the scope of any related contractual waiver of disclosure rights.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- Compliance issue. The primary risk is omission (failing to include a required disclaimer) rather than adverse drafting.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Commercial properties in residential-focused states:** Statutory disclosure requirements are often designed for residential transactions. For commercial properties, the buyer typically waives the residential disclosure statement, and the parties rely on the PSA representations and due diligence process instead.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Oregon:** ORS 93.040 requires the land-use disclaimer in all transfer instruments.
- **Washington:** RCW 64.06 seller disclosure statement applies but is waivable in commercial transactions.
- **California:** The Transfer Disclosure Statement (Cal. Civ. Code Section 1102) is required for residential but not commercial transfers.
- **New York:** No equivalent statutory disclaimer for commercial transactions, but various city-specific requirements may apply (e.g., NYC HPD filings, RPT forms).
- **Texas:** Property Condition Disclosure (Tex. Prop. Code Section 5.008) applies primarily to residential; commercial transactions are typically exempt.

## Attorneys' Fees

### Preferred Position

Include a mutual prevailing-party attorneys' fees provision covering all actions to enforce or interpret the agreement. This incentivizes both parties to comply with the agreement and deters frivolous claims.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.10):**

> If any action is brought by any party to this Agreement to enforce or interpret its terms or provisions, the prevailing party will be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action prior to and at trial and on any appeal therefrom.

The Detailed Seller Form (Section 11.8) adds broader scope: "whether at the investigative, pretrial, trial or appellate level." This broader formulation is preferable.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the provision is mutual. Some seller forms limit fee-shifting to actions by the buyer only.
- Include pre-trial, trial, and appellate fees.
- Specify that the prevailing party is determined by the court "based upon an assessment of which party's major arguments or position prevailed" (Detailed Seller Form language).
- This provision should survive Closing and termination.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Generally accepted in all jurisdictions except New York, where attorneys' fees provisions are less common in commercial contracts (New York follows the "American Rule" absent contractual override).

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- Standard provision that benefits the buyer by deterring Seller from asserting frivolous claims or refusing to honor post-Closing obligations.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** The American Rule applies absent contractual override. The contractual provision is enforceable.
- **California:** California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1021 similarly follows the American Rule, but contractual fee-shifting is common and enforceable.
- **Texas, Oregon, Washington:** All enforce contractual attorneys' fees provisions.

## No Joint Venture / No Partnership

### Preferred Position

Include a provision confirming that the agreement does not create a joint venture, partnership, or agency relationship between Buyer and Seller.

**Standard language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.13):**

> Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a joint venture between Buyer and Seller.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Standard boilerplate. The primary purpose is to prevent third-party claims that Buyer and Seller are engaged in a joint venture (which could create joint-and-several tort liability).
- Particularly important if the agreement contemplates a transition period or shared management during interim operations.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

No pushback expected.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- Standard provision.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Universally enforceable.

## No Waiver

### Preferred Position

Include a provision confirming that no waiver of any provision is effective unless in writing, that a waiver of one provision does not constitute a waiver of any other provision, and that a waiver in one instance does not constitute a continuing waiver.

**Standard language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.15):**

> No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver, nor shall a waiver in any instance constitute a waiver in any subsequent instance. No waiver shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party making the waiver.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the waiver provision requires a writing "signed by the party making the waiver" -- not merely a writing. Email communications could otherwise be construed as waivers.
- This provision works in conjunction with the written-amendment requirement and the time-of-the-essence clause to prevent arguments of waiver by course of conduct.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

No pushback expected.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- Standard provision.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Universally enforceable.

## No Merger (Anti-Merger)

### Preferred Position

Include an anti-merger provision confirming that the covenants, agreements, representations, and warranties in the PSA survive Closing and do not merge into the deed. Without this provision, the common-law doctrine of merger would extinguish the PSA's representations and warranties upon delivery and acceptance of the deed.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.18):**

> Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.4 and Section 14, the covenants, agreements, representations, and warranties made herein shall survive the Closing Date and shall not merge into the deed and its recordation in the official records or the delivery at Closing of any assignment of leases, general assignment, or bill of sale.

### Key Negotiation Points

- This is critical for preserving post-Closing claims for rep-and-warranty breaches.
- Note that the UNICO language includes "Subject to the limitations set forth in [rep survival and confidentiality sections]" -- this means the anti-merger is itself limited by the survival period and claim cap. Buyer should ensure the cross-references are accurate and do not inadvertently narrow the scope of surviving obligations.
- Ensure the anti-merger clause covers not just the deed but all closing documents (assignments of leases, assignments of contracts, bill of sale).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Seller may accept the anti-merger clause but argue that it should be subject to the rep-and-warranty survival limitations. This is reasonable and standard.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** -- Omission of this clause could result in loss of all post-Closing claims. The merger doctrine is a powerful common-law rule that extinguishes PSA obligations upon deed delivery.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** New York courts rigorously apply the merger doctrine absent an express anti-merger clause. This provision is essential in New York transactions.
- **California:** California courts also apply the merger doctrine but may be more willing to find exceptions based on the parties' intent.
- **All jurisdictions:** The anti-merger clause is considered standard and essential in institutional transactions.

## 1031 Exchange Cooperation

### Preferred Position

Include a mutual cooperation provision permitting either party to structure the transaction as a Section 1031 tax-deferred exchange, provided that: (1) the cooperating party incurs no additional liability or cost; (2) the Closing Date is not extended; and (3) the exchange does not modify the economic terms of the agreement.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.7):**

> Buyer may purchase the Property and Seller may sell the Property by completing one or more Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 tax-deferred exchange(s). Each party agrees to cooperate with the other in effecting such an exchange; provided, however, the cooperating party shall not incur any additional liability or financial obligations and the Closing Date shall not be extended or accelerated as a consequence of any such exchange.

The Detailed Seller Form (Section 11.22) provides more elaborate 1031 exchange mechanics, including: (a) 20-day advance notice requirement; (b) assignment to a qualified intermediary; (c) indemnification of the cooperating party; and (d) confirmation that the exchange does not condition Closing.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the 1031 provision does not make Closing contingent on completion of the exchange.
- The indemnification language in the Detailed Seller Form (the exchanging party indemnifies the cooperating party against third-party claims arising from the exchange, including claims by the qualified intermediary) is a reasonable protection that Buyer should accept.
- For Buyer-side 1031 exchanges involving reverse exchanges or build-to-suit exchanges, additional provisions may be needed (exchange accommodation titleholder, parking arrangements).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Minimal pushback expected. Both parties benefit from 1031 cooperation.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** -- Standard provision. The primary risk is that the exchange mechanics create Closing complications if not properly documented.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Federal tax law (IRC Section 1031) applies uniformly. State conformity to Section 1031 varies (California requires additional state-level reporting for exchanges involving California property via FTB Form 3840).
