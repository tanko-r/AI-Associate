# Due Diligence and Inspections -- Buyer Side Playbook

This playbook addresses the negotiation of due diligence and inspection provisions in commercial real estate purchase and sale agreements from the buyer/purchaser's perspective. It synthesizes institutional practice across seven precedent forms, including pro-buyer, pro-seller, and balanced forms, and is designed for use by AI agents during contract review.

---

## 1. Due Diligence Period Length and Structure

### Preferred Position
- Secure the longest possible DD period, measured in calendar days from the Effective Date. For institutional-grade acquisitions ($50M+), target 45-60 calendar days as the initial period, with the right to extend (see Section 14 below).
- The DD period should commence on the Effective Date (not on a later "DD Commencement Date"), unless buyer negotiates a floating start tied to receipt of all DD materials (as in the IL Pro-Buyer Form, Section 4.03, which defines the "Due Diligence Commencement Date" as the later of execution or delivery of all DD materials).
- The period should be defined by a specific calendar date and time (with time zone specified), not a "number of days" calculation, to avoid disputes. UNICO forms define the "Due Diligence Deadline" as a specific date and time with explicit time zone (e.g., "______p.m. Pacific Time, on ______, 20__").
- Structure: single continuous period, not bifurcated (i.e., no separate "physical inspection period" and "financial DD period" unless buyer benefits from staggered deadlines).

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Fixed date vs. rolling period**: A fixed calendar date is market standard and preferred by both sides for certainty. However, buyer should insist that the DD deadline auto-extends if seller fails to deliver all DD materials on time (see Section 3 below).
- **Commencement trigger**: Buyer should push for commencement tied to the later of (a) Effective Date and (b) full delivery of all DD materials listed on the exhibit. The IL Pro-Buyer Form (Section 4.03) expressly ties the "Due Diligence Commencement Date" to the later of mutual execution and delivery of all listed DD materials -- this is the strongest buyer position.
- **Business Days vs. Calendar Days**: Ensure the DD period is stated in calendar days (not business days) for longer periods, but critical sub-deadlines (e.g., notice periods, delivery dates) should be in business days to account for weekends and holidays.
- **Time-of-day cutoff**: Specify time of day and time zone. The UNICO Buyer Side form uses "___p.m. ***INSERT LOCAL TIME***" with explicit time zone instructions. The Detailed Seller Side form uses "5:00 p.m. East Coast time." The IL form uses "Central Time." Always confirm time zone matches operational reality.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller insists on 30 days or fewer**: Counter with 45 days minimum. If seller resists, accept 30 days only if (a) buyer receives a meaningful DD extension right (see Section 14), (b) DD commencement is tied to full delivery of all DD materials, and (c) seller has pre-populated a comprehensive data room.
- **Seller insists on fixed date with no extension**: Accept only if the data room is already substantially complete before PSA execution and buyer has had pre-contract access. Negotiate that the DD deadline auto-extends day-for-day for any delay in DD material delivery (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 3.3).
- **Seller insists on bifurcated periods**: Accept only if each component period is independently sufficient. Resist any structure that forces buyer to make a financial commitment (e.g., deposit going hard) before all physical and environmental DD is complete.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk**: Short DD period combined with no extension right and no floating start date. Buyer may be forced to waive DD contingency before completing Phase I environmental, zoning review, or financial underwriting.
- **Medium risk**: Adequate period but no auto-extension for delayed DD material delivery. Buyer bears risk that seller drags feet on data room access.
- **Low risk**: Period starts on full DD material delivery with auto-extension for delays and buyer has extension right.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office/Industrial**: 30-45 days is typical for stabilized, single-tenant NNN properties. 45-60 days for multi-tenant.
- **Retail (shopping center)**: 45-60 days minimum due to complexity of lease abstractions, co-tenancy clauses, and exclusive use provisions.
- **Multifamily**: 30-45 days typical for stabilized; 45-60 for value-add with significant deferred maintenance.
- **Data Center**: 60-90 days due to specialized MEP/infrastructure inspections, power capacity verification, and interconnection agreements.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: PSA Checklist (Purchaser) emphasizes negotiating for a "long due diligence review period" and attaching a schedule of required DD documents. NY practice often features no DD period at all in competitive deals, with buyer relying on pre-contract access.
- **California**: Strict time-is-of-the-essence culture. Ensure DD deadline is clearly stated.
- **Illinois**: The IL Pro-Buyer Form establishes a floating DD Commencement Date tied to full DD material delivery -- a structure that is less common in other jurisdictions but highly protective of buyer.
- **Oregon**: The Meadows form uses a "Property Approval Period" with a specific calendar end date.
- **Washington**: The Income Property Seller form (WA) ties DD period to a specific calendar date.

## 2. DD Deadline Mechanics: Approval Notice vs. Deemed Approval vs. Deemed Termination

### Preferred Position
- **Deemed termination on silence (strongest buyer position)**: If buyer fails to deliver an affirmative approval notice by the DD deadline, the agreement automatically terminates and the deposit is returned. This is the structure in the UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 3.2): "If Buyer fails to deliver the Buyer Approval Notice by the Due Diligence Deadline or if Buyer delivers the Buyer Disapproval Notice on or before the Due Diligence Deadline, then this Agreement shall terminate and Escrow Agent shall refund the Earnest Money Deposit to Buyer."
- This structure protects buyer from inadvertent waiver of the DD contingency if buyer's investment committee has not yet approved the deal.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Three possible structures**:
  1. **Affirmative approval required; silence = termination** (UNICO Buyer Side): Buyer must deliver "Buyer Approval Notice" to proceed; failure to deliver = automatic termination and deposit refund. STRONGEST BUYER POSITION.
  2. **Affirmative termination required; silence = deemed approval** (UNICO Seller Side, Detailed Seller Side, Meadows, Income Property Seller): Buyer must deliver termination notice by deadline; failure to deliver = deemed approval and deposit goes hard. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.2) states: "If Purchaser fails to give such notice prior to the expiration of the Study Period, it shall conclusively be deemed to have elected to waive its right to terminate." The Income Property Seller form (Section 5.3) similarly provides: "If Buyer fails to deliver the Termination Notice to Seller on or before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall be deemed to have timely provided an Approval Notice." STRONGEST SELLER POSITION.
  3. **Affirmative notice required either way; silence = termination** (IL Pro-Buyer Form, Section 4.03): Buyer must send termination notice; failure to terminate = deemed election to proceed. However, this form conditions the deemed election on buyer having had a complete DD period.
- **Deposit consequences**: In all forms, delivery of the approval notice (or deemed approval) triggers the deposit becoming non-refundable (subject to specified carve-outs such as seller default, title failure, casualty/condemnation, and estoppel failures). Ensure these carve-outs are expressly stated.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller insists on deemed approval on silence**: This is the market-standard seller position and is found in the majority of the precedent forms. If buyer must accept this structure:
  - Ensure the DD deadline is on a business day, not a weekend or holiday.
  - Implement robust internal calendaring and tickler systems.
  - Negotiate that the termination notice can be delivered by email to a specified address (not just formal notice).
  - Negotiate a "Buyer Approval Notice" mechanism where buyer's silence results in termination (the UNICO Buyer Side approach), or at minimum, require seller to send a reminder notice 3-5 business days before the DD deadline.
- **Compromise**: Buyer delivers a notice of its election (either to proceed or to terminate) by the deadline. Silence is treated as termination. This gives seller certainty that buyer will affirmatively communicate, while protecting buyer from inadvertent commitment.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk**: Deemed approval on silence combined with a short DD period. If buyer's investment committee meeting is delayed or notice is not timely delivered, buyer could be bound to purchase with a non-refundable deposit.
- **Mitigation**: Internal docketing, dual-notice requirements (email + formal), and negotiation of a reminder notice obligation on seller.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No meaningful variation by asset type. This is a pure deal-structure issue.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: PSA Checklist (Purchaser) explicitly warns buyer to "confirm whether the purchaser must affirmatively elect to proceed with the transaction, in which case the purchaser risks losing the deal if it does not act in time; or the transaction proceeds unless the purchaser expressly elects to terminate the agreement, in which case the purchaser risks being bound to complete the deal if it does not act in time."
- **All jurisdictions**: Time-is-of-the-essence provisions are generally enforceable. Courts will not excuse buyer's failure to deliver timely notice absent fraud or impossibility.

## 3. Seller's Delivery Obligations: DD Materials List, Data Room, and Timing

### Preferred Position
- Seller must deliver, or post to an online data room to which buyer has been given unlimited access, complete copies of all items on a comprehensive exhibit, within 3-5 business days after the Effective Date.
- The DD materials list should be attached as a detailed exhibit to the PSA (UNICO forms use "Exhibit C -- Delivered Due Diligence Items"). The list should be exhaustive, including at minimum:
  - All Leases (including all amendments, addenda, guaranties, SNDAs, commencement date agreements, and correspondence files)
  - Rent roll (current, with specific data fields required -- see IL form Section 4.01(g) for the most detailed specification)
  - Operating statements for prior 3 years, year-to-date, and current year budget
  - Real estate tax bills and assessment notices for prior 3 years, plus any tax appeal documentation
  - All Service Contracts (including property management, leasing, maintenance, security, landscaping, HVAC, elevator, janitorial, etc.)
  - All environmental reports (Phase I, Phase II, remediation reports, closure letters, agency correspondence)
  - Engineering/building condition reports
  - Roof warranty and maintenance records
  - As-built plans and specifications
  - Surveys (most recent ALTA survey)
  - Title policy or commitment with underlying exception documents
  - Certificates of occupancy, building permits, zoning approvals, variances
  - Insurance certificates and loss history for prior 3-5 years
  - Utility bills for prior 12-24 months
  - All warranties and guaranties (including construction, roof, systems)
  - Capital expenditure history for prior 3-5 years
  - Tenant correspondence files (including default notices, complaints)
  - ADA compliance reports
  - Seismic reports (if applicable)
  - Flood zone determinations
- **Day-for-day extension**: If seller fails to deliver all listed DD items by the DD Items Delivery Date, the DD deadline automatically extends day-for-day for each day of delay. UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 3.3) expressly provides this protection. The NY PSA Checklist also recommends this approach: "Include a day-for-day extension to the due diligence review period for each day of delay in delivering the due diligence materials to the purchaser."
- **Ongoing access**: Beyond the initial delivery, seller must make available any other written information concerning the Property in seller's possession or control, upon 2 business days' notice from buyer (UNICO forms, Section 3.3).
- **Data Room requirement**: All forms contemplate either physical delivery or data room posting. Buyer should insist on "unlimited access" to the data room (UNICO forms) and that the data room remain accessible through Closing.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **"Possession or control" definition**: UNICO forms define this narrowly as "information or materials located in files maintained by Seller or its property manager at the property management office serving the Property or at Seller's main office." Buyer should push to include materials held by seller's affiliates, advisors, and consultants.
- **Completeness obligation**: UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 3.3) requires seller to deliver "true, correct and complete copies." Seller Side forms water this down. Buyer should insist on the stronger formulation.
- **Timing**: 3 business days is the UNICO standard. IL form requires delivery within a specified number of days. Buyer should push for delivery within 3 business days or, better yet, have the data room populated before PSA execution.
- **Supplemental materials**: Buyer should have the right to request additional materials throughout the DD period, not just the initial list. IL form Section 4.02 provides broad ongoing access to seller's "nonconfidential property management files" and requires seller to "promptly and in good faith, comply with any reasonable request by Purchaser."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller objects to day-for-day extension**: This is a critical buyer protection. If seller resists, alternative is to require seller to certify completeness of the data room and toll the DD period only for materials that seller acknowledges are missing.
- **Seller objects to broad materials list**: Accept a narrower initial list, but preserve buyer's right to request additional materials and negotiate that seller must provide them promptly. Flag any missing categories as a DD issue.
- **Seller objects to "true, correct and complete" standard**: Accept "copies of" without the accuracy qualifier, but ensure buyer's DD disclaimer carve-out protects against material misrepresentation (see Section 16 below).

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk**: No day-for-day extension and no remedy if seller delays DD material delivery. Buyer may be forced to make a go/no-go decision on incomplete information.
- **Medium risk**: Day-for-day extension exists but materials list is too narrow, excluding key categories like environmental reports or tenant correspondence.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office**: Emphasize HVAC maintenance records, elevator inspection certificates, facade inspection reports (especially in NYC -- Local Law 11), fire/life safety compliance.
- **Industrial**: Environmental reports are critical (especially for former manufacturing sites). Confirm Phase I scope covers vapor intrusion. Request loading dock specifications, clear height certifications, power capacity documentation.
- **Retail**: Emphasize lease abstractions with co-tenancy, exclusivity, and kick-out provisions. Request CAM reconciliation history. Request percentage rent reports.
- **Multifamily**: Unit condition reports, rent-controlled/stabilized unit registers, regulatory agreements, Section 8 HAP contracts.
- **Data Center**: Power infrastructure documentation (including utility agreements, redundancy certifications, PUE data), interconnection agreements, SLAs with tenants, generator maintenance logs, UPS testing records.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: PSA Checklist recommends attaching a "schedule of required due diligence documents" as an exhibit and negotiating that seller deliver all materials within an agreed period.
- **Washington (RCW 64.06)**: Seller Disclosure Statement required for residential but generally waived in commercial deals. The Income Property Seller form includes an express waiver of right to receive Seller Disclosure Statement -- "This waiver does not extend to the section of the disclosure statement entitled 'Environmental.'" Buyer should ensure it still receives the Environmental section.
- **All jurisdictions**: Buyer should conduct independent verification and not rely solely on seller-provided materials.

## 4. Site Visit and Physical Inspection Rights

### Preferred Position
- Buyer and its representatives ("Buyer's Due Diligence Team") shall have the right to enter the Property during normal business hours to conduct inspections, examinations, studies, surveys, measurements, and tests ("Inspections"), upon reasonable advance notice (1 business day minimum, per UNICO forms).
- Seller's approval of inspection requests shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 3.4.1).
- Buyer's DD team should be broadly defined to include employees, agents, contractors, consultants, engineers, appraisers, and representatives.
- Access rights should extend through the DD period and, on a more limited basis, through Closing (IL form Section 4.05 provides access "at any time prior to the Closing").

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Notice period**: 1 business day (UNICO forms) is optimal for buyer. Seller may push for 2 business days (Detailed Seller Side, Section 5.1) or longer. Accept 2 business days as a reasonable compromise.
- **Seller's right to accompany**: Standard across all forms. Seller "shall be entitled to have a representative accompany Buyer and/or Buyer's Due Diligence Team during any Inspections" (UNICO forms). This is acceptable.
- **Seller's approval of non-invasive inspections**: Buyer should resist any requirement that seller affirmatively approve routine, non-invasive inspections. The UNICO Buyer Side form requires only "reasonable" access with seller's approval "not unreasonably withheld." The Detailed Seller Side form requires seller's written notice at least 2 business days in advance and seller's right to be present.
- **No disruption covenant**: All forms require buyer to conduct inspections in a manner that does not disrupt tenants or interfere with normal building operations. This is standard and acceptable.
- **Compliance with leases**: Buyer's access to tenant premises is governed by the terms of the applicable leases. This is standard and unavoidable.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller requires pre-approval for all inspections**: Resist. Accept only for invasive testing (see Section 5 below). Non-invasive inspections should require only notice, not approval.
- **Seller requires excessive notice period (5+ days)**: Counter with 1-2 business days. If seller insists on longer, negotiate that seller respond within 1 business day of receiving the request.
- **Seller limits access to business hours only**: Typically acceptable, but for data centers or 24/7 operations, negotiate after-hours access with advance coordination.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk**: Overly restrictive access provisions can delay buyer's DD and force buyer to make decisions on incomplete physical inspection data.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Data Center**: Negotiate access to critical infrastructure areas (generator rooms, UPS rooms, electrical switchgear, cooling systems) with appropriate protocols.
- **Industrial**: Ensure access to all outdoor areas, loading docks, tank farms, rail spurs, and any below-grade areas.
- **Multifamily**: Access to occupied units requires coordination with tenants per lease terms. Budget additional time.
- **Retail**: Anchor tenant spaces may have restrictive access provisions in their leases.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material jurisdictional variation on basic access rights. Local building codes may impose additional requirements for certain types of testing (e.g., asbestos sampling).

---

## 5. Invasive Testing Consent Requirements

### Preferred Position
- Buyer should have the right to conduct invasive testing (Phase II environmental sampling, soil borings, groundwater testing, building materials sampling, etc.) with seller's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.
- This is a departure from seller-standard language. Most forms give seller "sole discretion" to approve or withhold consent for invasive testing.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Seller sole discretion vs. reasonableness standard**: The UNICO forms (both Buyer and Seller Sides, Section 3.4.1) provide that invasive inspections require "Seller's prior written consent, which consent may be withheld in Seller's sole discretion." The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.1(g)) is even more restrictive: "without Seller's prior written consent, which Seller may give or withhold in its absolute discretion, Purchaser shall not conduct any Phase II exams, soil borings, testing or sampling." The Meadows form (Section 1.2) similarly requires "Seller's express prior written consent thereto, which consent may be given or withheld in Seller's sole and absolute discretion."
- **Buyer's preferred standard**: Consent "not unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed." If seller resists, negotiate reasonableness standard for Phase II environmental testing specifically (since buyer may have a lender requirement), with sole discretion reserved for structural invasive testing.
- **Procedural requirements**: The Meadows form requires buyer to "identify in writing what procedures such party desires to perform and the identity of the contractor or consultant which will perform such work." This is reasonable and buyer should comply proactively.
- **Scope of "invasive"**: Define what constitutes "invasive" testing to avoid disputes. Typically includes any testing that penetrates building surfaces, disturbs soil, or involves sampling of building materials. Non-invasive testing (visual inspections, air quality monitoring, moisture meters) should not require elevated consent.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller insists on sole discretion**: Accept sole discretion but negotiate specific carve-outs:
  1. Seller shall not unreasonably withhold consent for Phase I-recommended Phase II environmental testing.
  2. If seller withholds consent for testing recommended by buyer's environmental consultant, buyer shall have the right to terminate the agreement and receive a refund of the deposit.
  3. Seller must respond to invasive testing requests within 2-3 business days; failure to respond constitutes approval.
- **Fallback chain**:
  1. Best: Consent not unreasonably withheld for all invasive testing.
  2. Good: Consent not unreasonably withheld for environmental testing; sole discretion for structural testing.
  3. Acceptable: Sole discretion, but with deemed-approval on seller's failure to respond within 3 business days, plus termination right if consent is withheld for Phase I-recommended testing.
  4. Minimum: Sole discretion with no fallback, but buyer builds this risk into DD timeline and reserves right to terminate during DD period if it cannot complete testing.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk**: Seller has sole discretion and withholds consent for Phase II testing that buyer's lender requires. Buyer may be forced to either terminate or proceed without environmental clearance.
- **Mitigation**: Address lender Phase II requirements in a side letter or as a condition to waiver of DD contingency.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: Phase II environmental testing is almost always required. This is the asset type where invasive testing rights are most critical. Former manufacturing, chemical, or petroleum sites demand soil borings, groundwater monitoring wells, and vapor intrusion testing.
- **Office**: Invasive testing is less common but may be needed for asbestos, lead paint, or mold sampling in older buildings.
- **Retail**: Gas station outparcels or dry cleaning tenants create environmental risk. Phase II testing may be essential.
- **Data Center**: Soil borings for seismic evaluation; environmental testing if built on a former industrial site.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **CERCLA (federal)**: Buyer must conduct "all appropriate inquiries" (AAI) to qualify for CERCLA innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser defenses. A Phase I is the minimum. If Phase I identifies recognized environmental conditions (RECs), Phase II testing is strongly recommended.
- **State environmental transfer statutes**: NJ (ISRA), CT (Transfer Act), and certain other states may require environmental investigation as a condition of transfer. Ensure PSA allows sufficient time and access for compliance.

---

## 6. Insurance Requirements for Inspections

### Preferred Position
- Accept reasonable insurance requirements as a cost of doing business, but negotiate the specific terms to avoid excessive or commercially impractical requirements.
- Standard: Commercial general liability (occurrence) insurance of $1,000,000 per occurrence, naming seller and seller's property manager as additional insureds, with certificate of insurance delivered prior to first entry.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Coverage amounts**: UNICO forms (both sides, Section 3.4.4) require $1,000,000 CGL. The Meadows form requires $2,000,000 (or combination of primary and excess). The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.1) requires $5,000,000 per occurrence and $10,000,000 aggregate. The Income Property Seller form requires $2,000,000 CGL.
- **Buyer's position**: $1,000,000-$2,000,000 is reasonable and market. Resist $5,000,000+ requirements absent special circumstances (e.g., active construction site). If seller insists on higher limits, negotiate that the requirement can be met through a combination of primary and umbrella/excess policies.
- **Additional insured**: Seller and seller's property manager as additional insureds is standard across all forms.
- **Additional coverage types**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.1) requires protective liability, products/completed operations, broad form property damage, and contractual liability -- plus A.M. Best A-VII rating. The Meadows form also requires auto liability ($1,000,000) and workers' compensation. These are reasonable for buyer's contractors; ensure buyer's consultants can comply.
- **Certificate delivery timing**: UNICO forms require delivery "prior to entry upon the Property." The Detailed Seller Side form requires delivery "before Purchaser or its agents enter onto the Real Property." Buyer should ensure its consultants have standing certificates that can be produced promptly.
- **Claims-made vs. occurrence**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.1) requires occurrence-basis policies, and if claims-made is the only option, requires seller's prior written approval and a retroactive date prior to first access. This is reasonable.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller requires $5M+ limits**: Counter with $1M-$2M combined single limit. Accept $5M only if buyer's umbrella policy provides the excess coverage without additional cost.
- **Seller requires insurance from buyer's individual consultants**: This is standard in UNICO forms and others. Ensure buyer's DD team members carry adequate coverage and can produce certificates promptly.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Insurance requirements are generally administrative rather than substantive. The primary risk is delay if buyer's consultants cannot produce certificates quickly enough.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Data Center**: Higher insurance requirements may be justified given the value of tenant equipment and the sensitivity of the environment.
- **Industrial (with hazardous materials)**: Pollution liability insurance may be required for environmental consultants conducting Phase II testing.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material jurisdictional variation.

---

## 7. Indemnification for Inspection Activities

### Preferred Position
- Buyer should accept a reasonable indemnification obligation for damages caused by buyer's inspections, but with a critical carve-out for pre-existing conditions.
- The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 3.4.3) provides the best buyer formulation: buyer indemnifies seller "from and against any obligation, liability, claim...in any way arising from the Inspections or other activities by Buyer or Buyer's Due Diligence Team on or about the Property, **except to the extent arising out of (a) the mere discovery of any pre-existing condition at the Property, or (b) the negligence or misconduct of Seller, Seller's property manager or their agents.**"
- This carve-out is essential. Without it, buyer could be liable for reporting pre-existing environmental contamination that it discovers during inspections, which would create a perverse incentive not to conduct thorough DD.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Pre-existing conditions carve-out**: UNICO forms (both sides) include this carve-out. The IL Pro-Buyer form also includes it (Section 4.06(b), defining "Pre-Existing Conditions" and carving them out). The Income Property Seller form carves out "conditions on the Property created by Buyer's entry and testing (but not including any claims resulting from the discovery or disclosure of pre-existing physical or environmental conditions or the non-negligent aggravation of pre-existing physical or environmental conditions)."
- **Seller negligence carve-out**: UNICO Buyer Side form expressly carves out seller's negligence or misconduct. This is important -- if seller's building has a latent hazard that injures buyer's consultant, buyer should not be indemnifying seller.
- **Exclusion of consequential/punitive damages**: UNICO forms exclude "special, punitive, or consequential damages." Buyer should insist on this exclusion.
- **Lien-free obligation**: All forms require buyer to keep the property free of liens arising from inspections. Standard and acceptable.
- **Restoration obligation**: UNICO forms and others require buyer to restore the property to its prior condition if the transaction fails to close. This is reasonable for invasive testing but should be limited to damage actually caused by buyer's activities.
- **Survival**: All forms provide that the inspection indemnity survives termination of the agreement. Standard.
- **Scope of indemnity**: Contrast the broad Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.1(f)), which provides an indemnity against "any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and liens arising out of or in connection with the inspection of the Property by, or the presence thereon of, Purchaser or its affiliates" with NO pre-existing conditions carve-out. The Meadows form similarly provides a broad indemnity without a pre-existing conditions carve-out.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller refuses pre-existing conditions carve-out**: This is a significant buyer risk. Fallback positions:
  1. Best: Express carve-out for "mere discovery of pre-existing conditions" (UNICO formulation).
  2. Good: Carve-out for "pre-existing physical or environmental conditions" and "non-negligent aggravation" (Income Property formulation).
  3. Acceptable: Carve-out for buyer's obligation to report pre-existing conditions to governmental authorities (but not for liability arising from the discovery itself).
  4. Minimum: No carve-out, but buyer limits its inspections to non-invasive activities and relies on seller's environmental representations instead.
- **Seller demands mutual indemnification**: Buyer can offer reciprocal indemnification, but this is non-standard in this context and should be resisted.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk**: Broad indemnity without pre-existing conditions carve-out, combined with invasive environmental testing. If buyer discovers contamination, buyer could face liability for "causing" remediation costs by triggering reporting obligations.
- **Mitigation**: Ensure environmental consultant's professional liability insurance covers this risk. Consider structuring the Phase I as a "transaction screen" that does not trigger reporting obligations.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: Pre-existing conditions carve-out is most critical for industrial properties, where environmental contamination is more likely.
- **All asset types**: The carve-out matters for any property with potential environmental or structural issues.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **States with mandatory environmental reporting**: In states where environmental consultants have mandatory reporting obligations (varies by state), the pre-existing conditions carve-out becomes even more important.
- **Illinois**: The IL Pro-Buyer form expressly defines "Pre-Existing Conditions" and provides a detailed carve-out.

## 8. Tenant Interview Protocols

### Preferred Position
- Buyer should have the right to interview tenants designated by buyer, with seller using good faith diligent efforts to schedule such interviews within the first 15 days of the DD period.
- The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 3.5) is the strongest buyer position: "Seller shall use good faith, diligent efforts to schedule an interview between Buyer and those Tenant designated by Buyer to be held on mutually-convenient dates within the first 15 days after the Effective Date."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Seller involvement**: All forms require or permit seller to be present at tenant interviews. The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 3.6) requires buyer to provide seller "with the reasonable opportunity to be present at any oral communications and the right to reasonably approve any written communications."
- **Restriction on direct contact**: Seller-side forms uniformly prohibit buyer from contacting tenants directly without seller's approval. The UNICO Seller Side form states buyer "shall not engage in any written or oral communications with any Tenants without Seller's prior written approval, which may be withheld in Seller's sole and absolute discretion." The Detailed Seller Side form requires seller's representative to be present.
- **Timing**: The UNICO Buyer Side form targets the first 15 days. This is important because tenant information is critical to underwriting, and delays in scheduling interviews can compress the DD period.
- **Scope**: Buyer should be able to interview not just tenants, but also property managers, building engineers, and local land use officials. The NY PSA Checklist recommends access to "tenants, property managers, and local land use officials." The Meadows form requires seller to "make available to Buyer Seller's employees, representatives, contractors, building engineers, leasing agents and property managers."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller insists on sole discretion over tenant access**: Counter by requiring seller to schedule interviews within 15 days and attend all meetings.
- **Seller requires pre-approval of all questions**: Unreasonable. Counter that buyer will provide seller with general topics in advance, but seller cannot script the conversation.
- **Fallback**: Accept seller presence at all interviews, seller's right to arrange timing, and a prohibition on buyer contacting tenants independently. But insist that seller use "good faith diligent efforts" to facilitate (not just "reasonable efforts").
- **Government contact restrictions**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.1(i)) prohibits buyer from contacting governmental agencies concerning the Property, with a narrow exception for "zoning and/or building department" inquiries. Buyer should push back on any restriction that prevents buyer from confirming zoning compliance with local authorities. At minimum, ensure the exception covers zoning, building code, fire department, and health department inquiries.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk**: If seller delays or obstructs tenant interviews, buyer may not discover adverse leasing conditions (e.g., upcoming lease negotiations, tenant financial distress, maintenance complaints) until after the DD period expires.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office**: Focus on major tenant interviews regarding expansion/contraction plans, lease renewal intentions, and building satisfaction.
- **Retail**: Interview anchor tenants regarding co-tenancy triggers, exclusive use enforcement, and customer traffic patterns.
- **Multifamily**: Tenant interviews are less common; focus on property manager interviews about maintenance history and tenant complaints.
- **Industrial**: Interview tenants regarding environmental practices, chemical storage, and any on-site releases.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material jurisdictional variation.

---

## 9. Confidentiality of DD Materials

### Preferred Position
- Accept reasonable confidentiality obligations, but ensure buyer can share DD materials with its advisors, lenders, investors, and consultants without prior seller approval.
- The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.3) has the most comprehensive (and restrictive) confidentiality provisions, including specific performance and injunctive relief. The Income Property Seller form (Section 5.2) has basic mutual confidentiality.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Permitted disclosures**: Buyer must be able to share DD materials with:
  - Attorneys, accountants, and other professional advisors
  - Lenders and potential lenders
  - Equity investors and partners
  - Consultants and contractors retained for DD purposes
  - Rating agencies (if applicable)
  - The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.3(a)) limits disclosure to "employees, officers, directors, attorneys, accountants, lenders and investors" who have a need to know and have agreed to be bound. Ensure "consultants" and "potential equity investors" are added.
- **Standard of care**: "Confidential" treatment is standard. Resist any obligation that buyer must obtain written NDAs from each recipient individually -- instead, buyer should be responsible for any breach by persons to whom it discloses (Detailed Seller Side form imposes this standard).
- **Legal compulsion exception**: All forms should include a carve-out for legally compelled disclosures (subpoena, court order, regulatory requirement). The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.3(b)) includes this with a notice requirement.
- **Post-termination obligations**: Buyer should accept an obligation to return or destroy DD materials on termination (standard across forms) -- see Section 10 below.
- **Press releases**: Negotiate the right to issue press releases after Closing. The Income Property Seller form prohibits public announcements without consent.
- **Duration**: Confidentiality should survive termination but not indefinitely. 1-2 years is reasonable.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller demands specific performance remedy**: The Detailed Seller Side form includes this. Accept -- it is standard for confidentiality provisions in institutional deals.
- **Seller demands individual NDAs from all recipients**: Unreasonable and impractical. Counter with buyer's commitment to be responsible for breaches by its disclosees.
- **Seller demands buyer cannot share DD materials with potential equity co-investors**: Unacceptable for institutional buyers who may be syndicating equity. Insist on inclusion of "investors" in permitted disclosees, or at minimum "potential equity investors subject to confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those in this Agreement."

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** if buyer complies with standard confidentiality obligations. **Medium risk** if buyer needs to share with a broad universe of potential equity co-investors and the PSA restricts such disclosure.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No material variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material jurisdictional variation.

## 10. Return of DD Materials on Termination

### Preferred Position
- Accept an obligation to return or destroy DD materials on termination, provided:
  - The obligation is triggered only on termination for reasons other than seller's default.
  - Buyer may retain copies required by law, regulation, or internal compliance policies.
  - The return obligation does not apply to buyer's internal analyses, memoranda, or work product.
  - Buyer delivers materials "without representation or warranty" as to accuracy or completeness.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Trigger**: UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 3.6, marked as optional) conditions the return obligation on "termination for any reason other than a Seller default." This is the correct buyer position -- if seller defaults, buyer should not be obligated to hand over its DD work product.
- **Scope**: UNICO forms exclude "internal reports, analyses or communications" from the return obligation. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.3(c)) requires buyer to return all tangible confidential information, destroy all extracts and summaries, and certify destruction in writing. This is more burdensome but standard in seller-driven deals.
- **Certification**: The Detailed Seller Side form requires written certification of destruction. Accept if limited to DD materials received from seller (not buyer's own work product).
- **Buyer's reports**: The Meadows form and Income Property Seller form require buyer to provide copies of third-party reports obtained by buyer (e.g., Phase I environmental, building condition assessments) to seller on termination. This is increasingly common. Buyer should accept this only on the condition that reports are delivered "without representation or warranty" and "without any reliance rights."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller demands return of all DD materials including buyer's work product**: Resist. Buyer's internal analyses, investment committee memoranda, and valuation models are proprietary. Only materials received from seller or third-party reports commissioned by buyer should be subject to return.
- **Seller demands reliance rights on buyer's reports**: Resist. Buyer's environmental and engineering consultants typically prohibit reliance by third parties without a separate reliance letter and fee.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Return of DD materials is largely administrative.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No material variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material variation.

---

## 11. Environmental Assessments (Phase I / Phase II)

### Preferred Position
- Buyer should have the unrestricted right to conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment during the DD period, and the right to conduct Phase II testing subject to seller consent (see Section 5 above).
- Phase I should be conducted in accordance with ASTM E1527-21 to satisfy the "All Appropriate Inquiries" (AAI) standard under CERCLA.
- If Phase I identifies recognized environmental conditions (RECs), buyer should have the right to conduct Phase II testing, and if seller withholds consent for Phase II, buyer should have the right to terminate the agreement.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Phase I is non-invasive**: Phase I is a document review, site reconnaissance, and interviews -- it does not require soil borings or sampling. Seller should not be able to restrict buyer's Phase I activities.
- **Phase II consent**: See Section 5 above. Negotiate that seller's consent for Phase II shall not be unreasonably withheld if Phase I identifies RECs.
- **Environmental representations**: The UNICO forms (both sides, Section 5.1.10) include a representation that seller has received no written notice of Hazardous Materials violations. Buyer should insist on this representation and push for broader representations regarding actual knowledge of contamination, underground storage tanks, and environmental liens.
- **CERCLA definitions**: The UNICO forms include comprehensive definitions of "Environmental Laws" and "Hazardous Materials" -- ensure these are included and are broad enough to cover state environmental laws in addition to federal.
- **Survival of environmental representations**: Push for 12-month survival (UNICO Buyer Side) rather than 6-month (UNICO Seller Side). Environmental issues often do not surface until after closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller refuses Phase II consent**: See Section 5 fallback chain. At minimum, preserve buyer's termination right during DD period.
- **Seller limits environmental representations**: Accept knowledge-qualified representations but insist on identification of the "designated seller representative" whose knowledge is being referenced, and push for that person to have the most direct operational knowledge.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk**: Purchasing industrial or formerly industrial property without Phase II testing when Phase I identifies RECs. CERCLA liability attaches to current owners regardless of fault.
- **High risk**: Inadequate environmental representations that expire before buyer discovers contamination.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: Phase II is almost always warranted. Consider vapor intrusion testing per ASTM E2600.
- **Retail**: Dry cleaners (chlorinated solvents) and gas stations (petroleum) create specific risks.
- **Office**: Asbestos, lead paint, PCBs in older buildings. Mold in buildings with water intrusion history.
- **Multifamily**: Lead paint (pre-1978 buildings), asbestos, radon.
- **Data Center**: Diesel fuel storage for generators; coolant systems.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New Jersey (ISRA)**: Mandatory environmental investigation and remediation triggered by transfer of "industrial establishments." Can significantly extend closing timeline.
- **Connecticut (Transfer Act)**: Similar mandatory investigation/remediation for "establishments."
- **Illinois**: No mandatory transfer-triggered investigation, but buyer should conduct AAI for CERCLA protection.
- **Oregon/Washington**: State environmental cleanup statutes (Oregon DEQ, Washington MTCA) impose independent liability. Phase I/II essential.

---

## 12. Zoning and Entitlement Review

### Preferred Position
- Buyer should have the unrestricted right to review zoning, land use, building code compliance, and entitlement status during the DD period.
- Buyer should be permitted to contact local zoning and building departments directly, without restriction.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Government contact restrictions**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.1(i)) prohibits buyer from communicating with "any governmental agency concerning the Property," with a narrow exception for "zoning and/or building department" inquiries. Even this exception includes restrictions: buyer must not disclose the purchase price, must not request inspections, and must use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid triggering inspections.
- **Buyer's position**: Resist broad restrictions on government contacts. Buyer needs to confirm zoning compliance, certificate of occupancy status, building code compliance, fire/life safety compliance, ADA compliance, and any pending violations. At minimum, negotiate the right to contact zoning, building, fire, health, and environmental departments.
- **Zoning letters/certificates**: In some jurisdictions (e.g., Illinois), buyer can obtain a "Certificate of Zoning Compliance" as a closing deliverable. The IL Pro-Buyer form includes this as an option (Section 8.01(o)).
- **Entitlements**: Confirm that all development rights, variances, special use permits, and planned unit development approvals are included in the Property definition and will be assigned to buyer at closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller prohibits all government contact**: Unacceptable. At minimum, negotiate the Detailed Seller Side form's exception for zoning/building department inquiries.
- **Seller requires advance notice of government contacts**: Acceptable as a compromise. Buyer notifies seller 2 business days before contacting any governmental authority.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk**: Purchasing without confirming zoning compliance. Non-conforming uses may be lost if the property is significantly damaged or if the use is abandoned for a specified period.
- **Medium risk**: Inability to confirm absence of pending code violations.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office**: Confirm parking ratio compliance, FAR/density compliance, and any special zoning overlay restrictions.
- **Retail**: Confirm permitted uses align with existing tenant mix (e.g., restaurant use, drive-through, alcohol sales).
- **Industrial**: Confirm permitted uses include current operations. Environmental zoning overlays may restrict future use.
- **Data Center**: Confirm power infrastructure is permitted under current zoning. Data centers may face local opposition and restrictive zoning amendments.
- **Multifamily**: Confirm density and unit count comply with zoning. Affordable housing overlay requirements.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Illinois**: Certificate of Zoning Compliance is available in many municipalities.
- **New York City**: Zoning lot analysis is critical. Confirm development rights, zoning lot merger, and air rights.
- **California**: Seismic hazard zone disclosure requirements. CEQA compliance for any change of use.

---

## 13. Financial Audit Rights (Books and Records)

### Preferred Position
- Buyer should have full access to seller's books and records relating to the Property during the DD period, including operating statements, general ledger, tenant payment records, CAM reconciliations, tax bills, utility bills, insurance claims history, and capital expenditure records.
- Access should continue through Closing (not just the DD period) for purposes of preparing closing prorations and post-closing adjustments.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Scope of access**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.1) provides that "Seller agrees to make available to Purchaser...copies of all Leases and all applicable books and records relating to the Property and the operation and maintenance thereof to the extent that such materials are in Seller's possession or control and do not constitute Excluded Items." The IL Pro-Buyer form (Section 4.02) requires access to seller's "nonconfidential property management files" and imposes an affirmative duty on seller to "promptly and in good faith, comply with any reasonable request."
- **Operating statements**: Buyer should receive 3 years of operating statements plus year-to-date, including income, expenses, CAM charges, operating expense reimbursements, capital expenditures, and payment records (IL form Section 4.01(h) is the most detailed specification).
- **Audit rights**: Buyer should have the right to audit seller's books and records, including the right to have buyer's accountant review the general ledger, supporting invoices, and bank statements.
- **Post-closing access**: Negotiate that seller will cooperate with buyer's post-closing audit needs for a period of 1 year after closing, including making seller's former property manager available to answer questions and provide records.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller limits to "books and records in seller's possession"**: Accept but define "possession or control" broadly to include materials held by seller's property manager, accountant, and other agents.
- **Seller excludes internal analyses**: Accept exclusion of seller's internal memoranda and projections (standard "Excluded Items" carve-out in seller-side forms).
- **Seller refuses post-closing audit cooperation**: Push for at least 6 months of cooperation. Tie to the proration adjustment mechanism.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk**: Inadequate financial records can lead to mispriced acquisitions, especially for value-add properties where buyer is underwriting to a pro forma.
- **Medium risk**: Inability to verify CAM reconciliation history can result in significant post-closing adjustment disputes.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office/Retail**: CAM reconciliation history is critical. Request 3 years of reconciliation statements.
- **Multifamily**: Rent-stabilized properties require review of regulatory filings (e.g., DHCR registrations in NY).
- **Industrial (NNN)**: Financial DD is simpler; focus on lease payment history and tax/insurance reimbursements.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material variation.

---

## 14. Buyer's Right to Extend DD Period

### Preferred Position
- Buyer should have at least one right to extend the DD period for an additional 15-30 days, exercisable by written notice to seller delivered before expiration of the initial DD period.
- The extension should be available without additional deposit or at most a modest additional deposit (e.g., $50,000-$100,000) that remains refundable if buyer terminates during the extended period.
- The IL Pro-Buyer form (Section 4.04) provides the clearest formulation: buyer has "a one (1) time right...to extend the Due Diligence Period for an additional [NUMBER] days...upon written notice to Seller, given on or before the last day of the Due Diligence Period."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Trigger conditions**: Buyer should not have to demonstrate a reason for the extension. The IL form makes the extension available "in its sole and absolute discretion." The UNICO Buyer Side form does not include an express extension right but ties extensions to delayed DD material delivery and title commitment delivery.
- **Additional deposit**: Seller may require an additional earnest money deposit as consideration for the extension. Negotiate that this additional deposit remains refundable during the extended period.
- **Number of extensions**: The IL form provides one extension. If buyer needs more time, negotiate for two extensions of 15 days each rather than one longer extension.
- **Effect on closing date**: Ensure that the closing date is automatically extended by the same number of days as the DD extension.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller refuses any extension right**: Negotiate for a longer initial DD period instead. If buyer has 60 days initially, the need for an extension is reduced.
- **Seller requires non-refundable additional deposit**: Counter with a refundable additional deposit. If seller insists on non-refundable, limit the amount to $25,000-$50,000.
- **Seller requires buyer to demonstrate "diligent pursuit"**: The IL form includes a condition that buyer has been "proceeding with its Inspections in a diligent manner." This is subjective and could be problematic. Push for an extension right exercisable in buyer's sole discretion.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk**: Without an extension right, buyer may be forced to waive DD contingency before completing environmental testing, zoning review, or financial underwriting, particularly for complex properties.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Data Center**: Extension rights are more important due to specialized DD requirements (power infrastructure, interconnection agreements, tenant SLA review).
- **Industrial (environmental)**: Extension may be needed to complete Phase II testing, which can take 4-8 weeks to receive laboratory results.
- **Portfolio transactions**: Extensions are particularly important for multi-property acquisitions where DD must be coordinated across multiple sites.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material variation.

---

## 15. DD Materials Disclaimer (Seller Not Warranting Accuracy)

### Preferred Position
- Resist broad disclaimers that absolve seller of all responsibility for the accuracy of DD materials. At minimum, negotiate for:
  1. A representation that seller has not knowingly or intentionally withheld or concealed material documents or information (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 5.1.19: "Seller has not knowingly or intentionally withheld or concealed any documents or other information that would make the Due Diligence Materials made available or furnished to Buyer either untrue or misleading in any material manner").
  2. A representation that, to seller's knowledge, the DD materials are "true and correct in all material respects and do not omit any fact or circumstance necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading" (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 5.1.19).

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Seller's standard disclaimer**: Virtually all forms include a disclaimer that DD materials are provided "for informational purposes only" and "without representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such materials." See UNICO Seller Side (Section 3.3), Income Property Seller (Section 5.2), Detailed Seller Side (Section 7.1(a)).
- **Buyer's counter**: Accept the general disclaimer but insist on:
  1. An anti-concealment representation (UNICO Buyer Side Section 5.1.19).
  2. Express representations on specific matters (e.g., leases, rent roll, contracts, environmental notices) that are "true and correct" -- independent of the DD materials disclaimer.
  3. A representation that seller has provided all material DD items and has not selectively withheld documents.
- **Knowledge qualifier**: Seller will insist that any accuracy representation be qualified by "to Seller's knowledge." Accept this, but ensure the knowledge definition includes designated individuals with day-to-day operational knowledge and is not limited to the most senior executives who may be removed from property operations.
- **Anti-sandbagging**: The UNICO Seller Side form includes an optional anti-sandbagging provision (Section 5.4) that waives buyer's claims for representations that were untrue if buyer "knew" they were untrue at closing. Resist this provision. Alternatively, negotiate that buyer's knowledge is limited to "actual knowledge" (not constructive or deemed knowledge) and does not include information buried in voluminous DD materials.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller refuses any accuracy representation**: Unacceptable for institutional deals. At minimum, insist on the anti-concealment representation and specific subject-matter representations (leases, rent roll, contracts, environmental).
- **Seller includes aggressive anti-sandbagging**: The Detailed Seller Side form deems buyer to have knowledge of anything disclosed in the "Documents" (broadly defined to include all DD materials). Counter by limiting deemed knowledge to matters that buyer's designated representative actually reviewed, or by striking the anti-sandbagging provision entirely.
- **Fallback**: Accept the DD materials disclaimer with the anti-concealment representation and robust independent representations.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk**: Broad DD disclaimer with no anti-concealment representation and aggressive anti-sandbagging. Seller could provide misleading DD materials and then argue that buyer "deemed to have known" the truth based on some obscure document in the data room.
- **Mitigation**: Negotiate strong independent representations and ensure the anti-concealment representation survives closing.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No material variation. The risk is consistent across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: Sophisticated buyer standard is generally enforced. Courts may be less sympathetic to buyer's claims of reliance on seller-provided materials.
- **All jurisdictions**: "As-is" provisions are generally enforceable in commercial transactions between sophisticated parties, but fraud and intentional concealment claims typically survive.

---

## 16. Seller's Excluded Materials

### Preferred Position
- Minimize the scope of "Excluded Items" or "Seller's Excluded Materials." Accept exclusion of truly privileged or proprietary materials, but resist exclusion of any materials that are necessary for buyer's DD.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Standard exclusions (acceptable)**:
  - Attorney-client privileged communications
  - Internal memoranda and notes between seller's principals/members
  - Appraisals and internal valuation analyses
  - Drafts of reports (only final versions to be provided)
  - Materials relating to seller's marketing of the Property to other buyers
  - Organizational documents of seller's entities
  - Seller's acquisition DD materials (including PCA reports, title memos, market studies from seller's prior purchase)
- **Disputed exclusions (push back)**:
  - The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 3.3) excludes "due diligence reports, materials or analyses that Seller or its lender commissioned or generated in connection with its prior acquisition." Buyer should push back on this -- seller's prior Phase I/Phase II reports, PCA reports, and market studies are directly relevant to buyer's DD. At minimum, negotiate that environmental reports are excluded from the Excluded Materials carve-out.
  - The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 116) includes an extensive list of "Excluded Items" including environmental and engineering reports received by seller. This is overly broad.
  - Property management communications: Seller side forms may exclude communications with property managers and leasing brokers. Push back -- these contain critical operational information.
- **Seller's prior acquisition DD reports**: The UNICO Buyer Side form does NOT include the "Seller's Excluded Materials" concept at all. This is the strongest buyer position. The Seller Side form introduces it. Buyer should resist or narrow this category.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller insists on broad Excluded Materials**: Accept exclusion of appraisals, internal memos, and attorney-client materials. Push back on exclusion of:
  - Prior environmental reports (Phase I/Phase II)
  - Prior building condition reports
  - Prior market studies
  - Property management correspondence
- **Fallback**: If seller will not provide prior environmental reports, buyer should budget for and commission its own Phase I/Phase II and factor the timeline into the DD period.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk**: If buyer cannot access seller's prior environmental or building condition reports, buyer must commission its own, which adds cost and time to DD.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: Prior environmental reports are particularly critical and should not be excluded.
- **All types**: Prior building condition reports help buyer understand deferred maintenance and capital needs.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material variation.

---

## 17. Effect of Prior Early Access Agreements

### Preferred Position
- Any prior early access agreement between buyer and seller (or their affiliates) should be expressly superseded and replaced by the PSA. All inspection activities conducted under the prior access agreement should be deemed governed by the PSA's inspection provisions (including the indemnification and insurance requirements).
- The UNICO forms (both Buyer Side Section 3.4.6 and Seller Side Section 3.5.5) include this provision: "the Prior Early Access Agreement is hereby deemed superseded and replaced by this Agreement and the Inspections and all other activities undertaken by Buyer, Buyer's Affiliates or their employees, agents, contractors, consultants and representatives under such Prior Early Access Agreement shall be deemed governed by this Section 3.4."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Supersession language**: Ensure the PSA expressly supersedes the prior access agreement to avoid conflicting terms (especially regarding indemnification scope, insurance requirements, and confidentiality).
- **Retroactive application**: The UNICO formulation applies the PSA's inspection provisions retroactively to activities conducted under the prior access agreement. This benefits buyer if the PSA's indemnification is narrower than the prior access agreement's (e.g., PSA includes pre-existing conditions carve-out that prior access agreement lacked).
- **Ongoing obligations**: Confirm that any ongoing confidentiality or indemnification obligations from the prior access agreement are superseded, not cumulative.
- **Reference to specific agreement**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 92) references a specific "Access Agreement" by date and parties. This is best practice to avoid ambiguity.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller wants prior access agreement obligations to survive independently**: Resist. The PSA should be the sole governing agreement. If seller insists, negotiate that the more favorable (to buyer) terms of the two agreements govern for any overlapping topic.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk if addressed**: A clean supersession provision eliminates conflicts. **Medium risk if not addressed**: Buyer could face broader indemnification obligations under the prior access agreement that it thought were replaced.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No material variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material variation.

---

## 18. Reporting Obligations and Government Contact Restrictions

### Preferred Position
- Buyer should have the right to contact governmental authorities as needed for DD purposes, subject only to reasonable notice to seller.
- If buyer's DD reveals conditions requiring governmental disclosure, seller -- not buyer -- should be the party to make such disclosures.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Reporting**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.4) requires buyer to "immediately notify Seller" if DD reveals any condition requiring governmental disclosure, and provides that "Seller, and not Purchaser or anyone acting on Purchaser's behalf, shall make such disclosures as Seller deems appropriate." Buyer may disclose only if (a) outside legal counsel opines in writing that disclosure is legally required, and (b) buyer gives seller 10 days' prior written notice.
- **Government contact limitations**: As discussed in Section 12, the Detailed Seller Side form restricts buyer from communicating with governmental agencies. Negotiate appropriate carve-outs for zoning, building, fire, and health department inquiries.
- **Inspection triggers**: The Detailed Seller Side form requires buyer to "use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid triggering any inspections of the Property by any of such governmental authorities." This is seller-protective but reasonable -- buyer should not affirmatively request governmental inspections without seller's knowledge.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- See Section 12 above for zoning-specific government contact issues.
- **Seller demands absolute prohibition on government contact**: Unacceptable. At minimum, buyer must be able to confirm zoning compliance and check for open violations.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk**: If buyer cannot contact government agencies, buyer may not discover pending code violations, zoning issues, or environmental enforcement actions.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: Environmental agency contact may be necessary if Phase I reveals RECs or open enforcement actions.
- **All types**: Building department contact is necessary to confirm absence of open violations and certificate of occupancy status.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York City**: Multiple agencies with jurisdiction (DOB, FDNY, DEP, HPD for residential). Buyer needs to check for open violations across multiple systems.
- **Chicago**: Building department violations searches are standard DD. Ensure PSA permits.

---

## 19. AS-IS Provisions and Buyer's Release

### Preferred Position
- Accept a reasonable "as-is" provision, but ensure it is expressly subject to seller's representations and warranties surviving closing.
- Resist any release or waiver of CERCLA claims, contribution claims, or implied warranty claims that goes beyond the standard "as-is" framework.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Standard "as-is" language**: All seller-side forms include extensive "as-is" provisions. The Meadows form (Section 4.6) and Detailed Seller Side form (Section 7.1(b)) are the most aggressive, containing lengthy lists of disclaimed matters and broad releases.
- **Carve-out for seller's representations**: Every form carves out "Seller's express representations and warranties" from the as-is disclaimer. Ensure this carve-out is clear and broad enough to cover all of seller's representations, not just those in a specific section.
- **CERCLA waiver/release**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 7.1(b)-(c)) includes an express waiver of CERCLA claims against seller, including contribution and impleader claims. This is extremely aggressive. Buyer should resist or limit this waiver to pre-closing conditions that were within buyer's knowledge.
- **Covenant not to sue**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 7.1(d)) includes a "Covenant Not to Sue" that is enforceable as a defense to any action. This is the most aggressive seller protection. Buyer should resist or ensure it is subject to the seller representations carve-out.
- **California Civil Code Section 1542 waiver**: The Detailed Seller Side form includes a general waiver of unknown claims. While it does not cite Section 1542 by name, it achieves the same effect. Buyer should be aware that this waiver may extend to claims buyer did not know about at closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller insists on broad as-is and release**: Accept as-is with clear carve-out for seller's representations. Resist CERCLA waiver. If seller insists on CERCLA waiver, limit it to pre-closing conditions disclosed in DD materials and known to buyer.
- **Seller insists on covenant not to sue**: Accept only if clearly subject to buyer's right to enforce seller's surviving representations and warranties.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk**: Overly broad release waiving CERCLA contribution claims combined with minimal environmental representations. Buyer could be left without recourse if post-closing contamination is discovered.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: CERCLA waiver is most consequential for industrial properties. Resist strongly.
- **All types**: As-is provisions are standard in all asset types but the release scope varies.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **California**: Civil Code Section 1542 waivers are common and enforceable.
- **Oregon**: Similar unknown claims waiver provisions.
- **All jurisdictions**: Fraud and intentional concealment claims generally survive as-is provisions.
