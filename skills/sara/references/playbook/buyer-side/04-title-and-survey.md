# Title and Survey -- Buyer Side Playbook

This playbook addresses the negotiation of title and survey provisions from the buyer's perspective in institutional commercial real estate acquisitions ($50M+). All recommendations assume financed transactions without a financing contingency, multi-jurisdictional applicability, and full-lifecycle deal management.

## 1. Title Commitment Delivery Timing and Obligations

### Preferred Position
Seller must cause the title company to deliver to Buyer, in electronic format, a current preliminary title commitment (ALTA form) together with legible copies of all recorded documents referenced as Schedule B exceptions, no later than a date certain that is early enough to allow meaningful review before the due diligence deadline. The preferred structure is delivery within **5 business days of the Effective Date** or, if pre-arranged, by a separately defined "Title Commitment Delivery Date" (see UNICO Buyer Side, Section 4.1). If Seller fails to deliver by the stated deadline, the Due Diligence Deadline should extend on a **day-for-day basis** for each day of delay.

Key drafting elements:
- Seller "shall request" or "shall cause" the title company to issue the commitment -- the latter is stronger.
- Delivery must include the commitment **and** all underlying exception documents (Title Documents). Receiving only the commitment without the recorded instruments is insufficient for meaningful review.
- Electronic delivery is now standard. Specify that PDFs of all recorded instruments must be searchable/legible.
- If the commitment is ordered prior to the Effective Date (common in marketed deals), reference the specific commitment number and effective date (see Meadows, Section 1.2, referencing Commitment No. 322100176).

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Day-for-day extension**: This is critical and present in the UNICO Buyer Side form. Without it, Seller can effectively shorten Buyer's diligence period by delaying the title commitment.
2. **"Best available copies"**: The UNICO Buyer Side form uses "best available copies" of Title Documents; push for complete, legible copies and require Seller to use reasonable efforts to obtain legible copies if the title company's copies are inadequate.
3. **Pre-Effective Date delivery**: In auction/marketed deals, the commitment is often available in the data room before signing. Reference it by number but preserve the right to obtain updates.
4. **Seller-ordered vs. Buyer-ordered**: Buyer prefers to order its own commitment from its preferred title company (see Section 11 below on title company selection). If Seller insists on using its title company, Buyer should negotiate the right to obtain a simultaneous-issue commitment from a second company.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "We will make available what we have; Buyer can order its own commitment." **Fallback**: Accept, but ensure day-for-day extension applies if Seller's cooperation is required for the title company to issue the commitment (e.g., providing organizational documents, prior title policies).
- **Seller pushback**: "No day-for-day extension." **Fallback**: Negotiate a hard stop -- if commitment is not received within X days of Effective Date, Buyer may terminate and receive return of earnest money.
- **Seller pushback**: "Commitment was in the data room pre-signing; no additional delivery obligation." **Fallback**: Accept the pre-signing commitment as the initial delivery but preserve the right to obtain updates through closing, with full objection rights to new matters.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk** if no day-for-day extension exists and the due diligence period is short (15-20 days). Buyer may lose meaningful title review time.
- **Medium risk** if commitment is delivered but underlying documents are incomplete. Buyer should track receipt of all exception documents and send a written notice identifying missing items.
- **Low risk** in marketed deals where the commitment was prepared pre-marketing and is already available.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Data centers**: Title commitments for data center sites often reveal complex easement structures for fiber, power, and utility infrastructure. Budget additional review time and request delivery at least 7-10 business days before the diligence deadline.
- **Industrial/logistics**: Ground leases, rail easements, and environmental use restrictions are common. Ensure all underlying CC&Rs and REA documents are included.
- **Multifamily**: Condominium regime documents, if applicable, must be delivered as part of the title package. Verify that the commitment covers both the unit and common elements.
- **Retail**: REAs, OEAs, and exclusive-use restrictions are critical. Require Seller to deliver not just recorded documents but also any unrecorded side letters or amendments referenced in recorded instruments.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: Title searches are typically conducted by the buyer's attorney or a title abstract company. The commitment is often not issued until the abstract is completed. Build in additional time (see NY Checklist, Title Review section).
- **California**: Preliminary reports (not "commitments") are issued. The distinction matters because a preliminary report is an offer to insure, not a commitment. Ensure the language covers "preliminary reports" in CA deals.
- **Texas**: The Texas Department of Insurance regulates title insurance rates. Promulgated rates apply; focus negotiation on endorsements rather than premium splitting.
- **Colorado**: The PSA Detailed Seller Side form (ASB/UNICO) references Fidelity National Title in the Garden City, NY office for a Colorado property, demonstrating that national underwriters can issue commitments for properties in any state. Ensure local counsel reviews state-specific requirements.

## 2. Title Objection Period and Mechanics

### Preferred Position
Buyer should have a defined "Title Objection Date" that is a specified number of **business days** after the **later of** (a) Buyer's receipt of the Title Commitment and all Title Documents, or (b) the Effective Date (see UNICO Buyer Side, Section 1.6). This "later of" construct is critical -- it ensures Buyer does not lose review time if the commitment is delivered late.

The objection must be in writing and should identify each exception to which Buyer objects with specificity. Buyer's failure to timely object should result in unobjected items becoming Permitted Exceptions. However, this "deemed approval" should **not** apply to:
- Monetary liens created by or through Seller
- Exceptions relating to Seller's authority or good standing
- Standard/general exceptions that would be removed by Seller's delivery of an owner's title affidavit
- Any exception first appearing after the initial Title Objection Date (covered by gap/supplemental update provisions)

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Trigger for objection period**: The "later of" formulation (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 1.6) is far superior to a fixed calendar date. Never accept a fixed date that does not account for late delivery of the commitment.
2. **Length of objection period**: 10-15 business days is standard for institutional deals. The PSA Seller (income property) form allows only 10 days from Effective Date; push for measurement from receipt of commitment.
3. **Scope of objections**: Buyer should be permitted to object to **any** title matter disclosed in the commitment, survey, or any update. The ASB/UNICO Detailed Seller Side form attempts to prohibit Buyer from objecting to matters in subsections (a) through (h) of the Permitted Exceptions definition -- resist this.
4. **Survey objections bundled**: Buyer should have the right to object to survey matters on the same timeline as title matters (see Meadows, Section 1.2, which bundles title and survey objections together).
5. **Interaction with due diligence period**: In forms where title objections are handled within the broader due diligence/study period (Meadows, ASB/UNICO Detailed), Buyer must ensure the title objection and response cycle can be completed before the diligence period expires, or that title matters are carved out from the general diligence contingency.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "Title Objection Date should be a fixed date, not tied to receipt." **Fallback**: Accept a fixed date but add a day-for-day extension if commitment is delivered late, and preserve gap/update objection rights.
- **Seller pushback**: "Buyer cannot object to items (a)-(h) of Permitted Exceptions." **Fallback**: Review the enumerated items carefully. Accept carve-outs for truly standard items (current-year taxes not yet due, rights of tenants under leases) but reject blanket prohibitions on objecting to recorded CC&Rs, easements, or other matters that may be economically significant.
- **Seller pushback**: "Buyer's objection must be a single consolidated notice." **Fallback**: This is reasonable for the initial objection (see ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(b)) but must not apply to supplemental/gap updates.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk**: A "deemed approval" provision that causes unobjected items to become Permitted Exceptions without adequate review time. If the commitment arrives 2 days before the objection deadline, Buyer has effectively waived title review.
- **High risk**: Tying the title objection deadline to the end of the due diligence period without sufficient time for the cure/response cycle. If Buyer objects on the last day of diligence and Seller has 5 business days to respond, the response period extends beyond the diligence period -- but Buyer may have already waived its general diligence termination right.
- **Mitigation**: Structure the PSA so that title objection rights survive expiration of the general due diligence period. Title is a condition to closing, not merely a diligence item.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office**: Focus on reviewing access easements, parking easements, and any shared-infrastructure agreements with adjacent buildings.
- **Industrial**: Rail spur easements, truck court access easements, and environmental use restrictions require specialized review. Industrial properties often have complex utility easement configurations.
- **Retail**: REA provisions on co-tenancy, exclusive use, and operating covenants are title matters (often recorded). Budget additional review time.
- **Data centers**: Power line easements, telecommunications easements, and fiber-optic access rights are critical. These may not appear on standard title commitments if unrecorded.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: Custom is for a single written title objection notice. The NY Checklist recommends negotiating deadlines for (i) purchaser's objection notice, (ii) seller's election to cure or refuse, and (iii) purchaser's response to seller's election. All three deadlines should be specified.
- **Illinois**: Title objection procedures are typically governed by the contract and informed by local custom. Illinois uses commitment for title insurance forms from Chicago Title or similar underwriters.
- **Oregon**: The Meadows form (Oregon property) bundles title and survey objections into the Property Approval Period, with separate objection and response mechanics.
- **Washington**: The PSA Seller (income property) form provides 10 days from Effective Date for title review, which is aggressive for complex properties.

## 3. Seller's Cure Rights: Mandatory Cure Items vs. Elective Cure

### Preferred Position
The PSA should distinguish between (a) items Seller is **obligated** to cure/remove regardless of cost and (b) items Seller may **elect** to cure or decline to cure. This is the single most important structural element of the title provisions from the Buyer's perspective.

**Mandatory cure items** (Seller must remove at or before Closing, with no cap on expenditure):
1. All monetary liens created by, through, or under Seller (mortgages, deeds of trust, security interests, UCC financing statements) -- see UNICO Buyer Side, Section 4.3(x)
2. Mechanic's liens and materialmen's liens arising from work contracted for by Seller
3. Judgments and tax liens against Seller
4. Any exception voluntarily created by Seller after the Effective Date without Buyer's consent
5. Exceptions relating to Seller's power, authority, or good standing -- see UNICO Buyer Side, Section 4.3(y)
6. General/standard exceptions that would be removed through Seller's delivery of an owner's title affidavit -- see UNICO Buyer Side, Section 4.3(z)

**Elective cure items** (Seller may choose to cure or not):
- All other Title Objections raised by Buyer (e.g., old easements, CC&Rs, encroachments shown on survey)

The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 4.3) establishes this framework clearly: mandatory cure for categories (x), (y), and (z), with everything else subject to Seller's election.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **No dollar cap on mandatory cure**: Seller should be required to satisfy all monetary liens from the proceeds of sale regardless of amount. The ASB/UNICO Detailed Seller Side form caps Seller's cure obligation at **$10,000** for non-Voluntary Liens -- this is grossly inadequate for institutional deals and should be rejected.
2. **"Voluntary Liens" definition**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form defines "Voluntary Lien" to include mortgages, mechanic's liens from Seller-contracted work, and other voluntary monetary encumbrances. This is the category Seller must always satisfy. Push for a broad definition.
3. **Cure from proceeds**: Include language permitting Seller to use the Purchase Price or any portion thereof to clear title encumbrances at Closing, with provision for recording pay-off instruments post-closing (see ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(d)).
4. **No requirement to bring suit**: Seller will insist (and it is reasonable to concede) that Seller shall not be required to bring suit to clear title defects for elective cure items. However, for mandatory cure items (monetary liens), this limitation should not apply -- Seller should be required to pay them off regardless.
5. **"Remove" definition**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form defines "Remove" to include causing the title company to **affirmatively insure over** the exception without additional cost or liability to Buyer. This is an acceptable alternative to actual removal for non-monetary items. For monetary items, insist on actual satisfaction and release.
6. **Seller's response deadline**: If Seller elects to cure, it should be contractually obligated to do so by Closing (see UNICO Buyer Side, Section 4.3). If Seller declines, Buyer must have clear options (see Section 4 below).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "Cap Seller's cure obligation at $X (e.g., $10,000 or $50,000) for non-monetary items." **Fallback**: Accept a reasonable cap for non-monetary items (which Seller would be electing to cure anyway) but never accept a cap for mandatory cure items (monetary liens, judgments). The ASB/UNICO Detailed form's $10,000 cap is a starting position for negotiation -- push for $50,000-$100,000 or, ideally, no cap for Voluntary Liens.
- **Seller pushback**: "Seller should not be required to cure mechanic's liens if Seller disputes them." **Fallback**: Require Seller to bond around disputed mechanic's liens or cause the title company to insure over them. Seller should not be permitted to pass the risk of a lien dispute to Buyer.
- **Seller pushback**: "Include existing financing as a Permitted Exception (loan assumption deal)." **Fallback**: If the deal involves assumption of existing financing, the existing loan should be expressly excluded from Seller's mandatory cure obligation, but only if the lender has given (or is in the process of giving) an assumption approval (see UNICO Buyer Side, Section 4.3, optional text re: Existing Loan Assumption Approval).

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk**: PSAs that do not contain mandatory cure provisions or that cap Seller's monetary obligation at a nominal amount. Buyer could arrive at Closing to find a $5M mechanic's lien that Seller has no obligation to cure.
- **High risk**: Seller's failure to satisfy its existing financing. Always require payoff from proceeds unless the deal is structured as an assumption.
- **Medium risk**: Disputed mechanic's liens from Seller's contractors. Address with bonding/insurance-over requirements.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Development/value-add assets**: Higher risk of mechanic's liens from ongoing construction. Require a construction lien search (in addition to the standard title search) within 10 days of Closing.
- **Multifamily**: Tax liens and water/sewer charges are common. Include utility charges in the mandatory cure category.
- **Data centers**: Equipment financing (UCC filings on generators, HVAC, etc.) may encumber fixtures that are part of the real property. Ensure UCC searches are conducted and that Seller must remove any UCC filings covering fixtures.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: The NY Checklist specifically requires Seller to cure "mortgages, security instruments, financing statements, or other instruments securing debt" and "judgments and liens...that are due and payable" with **no cap** on amounts. This is the institutional standard.
- **Colorado**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form (Colorado property) uses the $10,000 cap, reflecting a seller-favorable market position. Colorado does not have statutory mechanic's lien priority issues as complex as some other states.
- **Oregon**: Oregon's construction lien statute (ORS 87.005 et seq.) provides that construction liens relate back to the date of commencement of the improvement. Buyers should require a bring-down lien search close to Closing.
- **California**: Mechanic's liens in California can be particularly problematic due to the relation-back doctrine. Require Seller to provide a Notice of Completion if applicable.

## 4. Buyer's Remedies if Seller Declines to Cure

### Preferred Position
If Seller elects not to cure a Title Objection (or fails to respond within the Seller Title Response Period, which should be deemed an election not to cure), Buyer should have the following options:

**Option A -- Terminate and receive full return of earnest money.** This is the non-negotiable baseline. The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 4.3) provides Buyer with 5 business days after expiration of the Seller Title Response Period to deliver a termination notice, with return of earnest money within 2 business days.

**Option B -- Waive the objection and proceed to Closing.** If Buyer elects not to terminate, the unobjected Title Objections become Permitted Exceptions. This is standard in all forms reviewed.

The critical structural question is **when** Buyer must elect. Preferred approach: Buyer's election between termination and waiver should come **after** Seller's response, not before. Buyer should not be forced to decide whether to terminate before knowing which items Seller will and will not cure.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Buyer's election period**: 5 business days after Seller's election not to cure is standard (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 4.4; UNICO Seller Side, Section 4.3). Resist attempts to shorten this to 3 days.
2. **Deemed waiver**: If Buyer fails to exercise its termination right within the election period, uncured Title Objections become Permitted Exceptions. This is standard and unavoidable, but Buyer should ensure the election period is adequate.
3. **No purchase price reduction**: Seller will typically insist that Buyer has no right to a purchase price reduction -- it is either terminate or waive. This is market for institutional deals.
4. **Interaction with due diligence period**: In the UNICO Buyer Side form, the title objection/cure cycle occurs **within** the broader due diligence period. If Buyer waives its due diligence contingency (Section 3.2), uncured Title Objections automatically become Permitted Exceptions. This is a Seller-favorable construct. The preferred Buyer position is that title objection rights are **independent** of the due diligence contingency and survive its expiration.
5. **Seller's extension right for cure**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form permits Seller to extend the Closing Date to Remove title exceptions (Section 4.1(e) / 6.1(b)). Buyer should cap this extension (30 days maximum) and ensure no extension is available for Voluntary Liens, which must be satisfied from proceeds at Closing.
6. **Intervening title objections (gap matters)**: After the initial objection period, if new exceptions appear, Buyer must have a separate termination right (see Section 5 below). The ASB/UNICO Detailed form provides this in Section 4.1(c) with the "Purchaser Intervening Title Objection Notice."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "Buyer's only remedy is to terminate; no specific performance for title cure." **Response**: This is generally market. Buyer's remedy for title defects is termination and return of deposit, not specific performance to force Seller to cure title.
- **Seller pushback**: "Buyer must elect within the due diligence period; no post-diligence termination right for title." **Fallback**: At minimum, preserve a termination right for matters that are mandatory cure items (monetary liens) that Seller fails to satisfy. Buyer should also preserve a termination right for new/intervening title matters that arise after the diligence period (see Section 5).
- **Seller pushback**: "Deemed waiver period is 3 business days, not 5." **Fallback**: 3 business days may be acceptable if the underlying cure/response cycle provides adequate time. The total elapsed time from Buyer's initial objection through Seller's response through Buyer's election should be at least 15-20 business days.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk**: PSA structures where Buyer's only title-related termination right expires with the general due diligence period. If a new lien appears after diligence expiration, Buyer has no exit.
- **High risk**: Short deemed-waiver periods combined with complex title issues. Buyer may inadvertently waive objections by failing to respond in time.
- **Mitigation**: Calendar all title-related deadlines independently. Do not rely on the general due diligence calendar to track title objection/response/election dates.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Minimal variation by asset type. The remedial framework (terminate or waive) is consistent across all commercial property types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: The NY Checklist specifies that if Seller "cannot (or refuses to) cure a title objection, the purchaser may choose to either: terminate the contract, and have the deposit returned; or close the transaction, with such title as the seller can transfer." This binary is universal.
- **Oregon/Washington**: Forms reviewed follow the same terminate-or-waive framework.
- **Colorado**: Same framework; the ASB/UNICO Detailed form adds the Seller's right to extend Closing to effect cure.

---

## 5. Gap/Supplemental Title Updates and Objections

### Preferred Position
Buyer must have the right to receive updated title commitments (supplemental reports) at any time between the initial commitment and Closing, and to object to any **new or modified exceptions** that appear in such updates. The objection and response mechanics for gap/supplemental matters should mirror the initial title objection process.

The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 4.4) provides:
- If the commitment is amended at any time to indicate new or modified Exceptions, Buyer has **5 business days** from receipt of the amended commitment and underlying documents to deliver a New Title Objection.
- Seller has **5 business days** to respond (elect to cure or not).
- If Seller declines, Buyer may (a) accept the new exception as a Permitted Exception or (b) terminate with return of earnest money within **5 business days** of Seller's election.
- Buyer's failure to act within 5 business days of Seller's election not to cure is deemed acceptance.
- The Closing Date extends as necessary to accommodate these time periods.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Automatic Closing Date extension**: This is essential. Without it, the gap objection cycle could be truncated by the Closing Date. The UNICO Buyer Side form expressly provides for this extension.
2. **No limitation on timing**: Buyer should be able to object to new matters at **any time** before Closing, not just during the due diligence period. The NY Checklist states: "Include the right to object to any new title matter raised by the title company at any time before the closing."
3. **"Material Adverse Effect" qualifier**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed Seller Side form limits Buyer's intervening title objection rights to matters that "can reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on title." Resist this qualifier -- all new exceptions should be subject to objection, not just material ones.
4. **Buyer's knowledge cutoff**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form (Section 4.1(c)) prohibits Buyer from objecting to intervening matters that were within "Purchaser's Knowledge as of the end of the Study Period." This is somewhat reasonable (Buyer should not sandbag) but should be limited to actual knowledge, not constructive knowledge.
5. **Seller-ordered vs. Buyer-ordered updates**: Require Seller to cause the title company to issue supplemental reports at Seller's expense, or at minimum, to cooperate with Buyer's request for updates. The PSA Seller (income property) form (Section 4(b)) requires Seller to "cause the Title Company to provide to Buyer supplemental reports...covering any additions or deletions from the date of the Commitment through the Closing Date."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "Gap objections limited to matters having a Material Adverse Effect." **Fallback**: Accept, but define "Material Adverse Effect" to include any lien, encumbrance, or exception that (i) is monetary in nature, (ii) restricts use of the Property, (iii) grants rights to third parties, or (iv) would not be insured over by the title company without additional premium or conditions.
- **Seller pushback**: "No Closing Date extension for gap objections." **Fallback**: This is a deal-breaker. Without the extension, Buyer could be forced to close with uncured gap defects or lose its deposit. At minimum, negotiate a short automatic extension (5-10 business days) to allow the objection/response cycle to complete.
- **Seller pushback**: "Buyer may not object to matters Buyer knew about before the Study Period ended." **Fallback**: Accept a carve-out for matters within Buyer's **actual** (not constructive) knowledge, but ensure this does not apply to matters first appearing of record after the Study Period.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk**: PSAs with no gap update/objection provision. Seller could record an easement or other encumbrance between signing and closing with no Buyer recourse.
- **High risk**: Gap provisions that do not extend the Closing Date. The objection/response/election cycle requires at least 15 business days; if the gap matter appears 5 days before Closing, the cycle cannot complete.
- **Medium risk**: "Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers that allow minor but economically significant matters (e.g., a new utility easement across a parking area) to slip through.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **All asset types**: Gap objection rights are equally critical regardless of property type. However, the likelihood of gap issues varies:
  - **Development sites**: Higher risk of new mechanic's liens during the contract period.
  - **Operating assets**: Lower risk, but watch for new easements granted by Seller to utility companies or adjacent owners during the contract period.
  - **Retail**: Watch for new REA amendments or exclusive-use restrictions recorded between signing and closing.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: Gap coverage in New York is typically addressed through the title company's "date-down" endorsement at closing. Ensure the PSA requires the title company to issue such endorsement.
- **All jurisdictions**: The title company will typically perform a "gap search" or "bring-down" search close to closing. Ensure the PSA requires this search and provides Buyer with objection rights to new findings.

## 6. Permitted Exceptions Definition and Negotiation

### Preferred Position
"Permitted Exceptions" should be a carefully curated list, not a broad catch-all. The definition should be built through the objection/approval process, not pre-defined to include categories of items that Buyer has not reviewed.

**Acceptable Permitted Exceptions (minimal baseline):**
1. Real property taxes and assessments for the current year, not yet due and payable
2. Rights of tenants under the Leases (as tenants only, without purchase options or rights of first refusal unless separately approved)
3. Matters approved or deemed approved by Buyer through the title objection process
4. Matters created, permitted, or approved by Buyer

**Items that should NOT be included in the Permitted Exceptions definition without Buyer's specific review and approval:**
- Recorded CC&Rs, restrictions, easements, or REAs (Buyer must review each one)
- Title company's standard policy jacket exclusions (these can be negotiated through endorsements)
- "Matters which would be shown by a correct survey or physical inspection" (this is a blanket waiver of survey objection rights)
- Any matter created by Seller after the Effective Date
- Zoning and land use regulations (while technically a Permitted Exception, Buyer should confirm compliance)

The Meadows form (Section 1.2) includes as Permitted Exceptions: "(iii) matters which would be shown by a correct survey of the Property or a physical inspection of the Property." This is a Seller-favorable provision that effectively eliminates Buyer's survey objection rights and should be resisted.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **"Built" vs. "pre-defined" Permitted Exceptions**: The UNICO Buyer/Seller Side forms build the Permitted Exceptions definition through the objection/approval process -- items not objected to (or objected to but not cured, and Buyer elects to proceed) become Permitted Exceptions. This is the preferred approach.
2. **Pre-defined categories**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form pre-defines 8 categories of Permitted Exceptions (subsections (a)-(h)) that Buyer cannot object to. Review each category carefully:
   - Taxes not yet due: acceptable
   - Rights of tenants: acceptable if limited to "as tenants only, and not as purchasers under any option"
   - Standard printed exceptions: negotiate removal through extended coverage and endorsements
   - Matters disclosed in the Offering Memorandum: resist -- the OM is not a legal document and should not define Permitted Exceptions
   - Zoning: acceptable as a general matter, but Buyer should confirm compliance independently
3. **Survey matters**: Never agree that "matters shown on survey" are automatically Permitted Exceptions. Buyer needs the right to object to survey-revealed items (encroachments, easement locations, setback violations).
4. **Post-Effective Date matters**: Any exception created by Seller after the Effective Date without Buyer's written consent should **never** be a Permitted Exception (see Section 10 below on voluntary exceptions).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "Standard industry Permitted Exceptions include all recorded easements and restrictions." **Fallback**: Accept that recorded easements and restrictions may become Permitted Exceptions, but only through the objection/approval process, not by definition.
- **Seller pushback**: "Include all matters in the title commitment that Buyer had access to in the data room." **Fallback**: Receiving a document in a data room does not constitute approval. Buyer must retain the right to object.
- **Seller pushback**: "Matters shown on survey are Permitted Exceptions." **Fallback**: At most, accept that matters shown on the **Existing Survey** (pre-dating the PSA) are Permitted Exceptions only if Buyer does not timely object. Never accept that matters shown on the Updated Survey are automatically Permitted Exceptions.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk**: Broadly defined Permitted Exceptions that encompass un-reviewed items. Buyer could acquire title subject to restrictive covenants, easements, or encumbrances that impair the intended use or value.
- **High risk**: "Matters shown on survey" carve-out. This eliminates Buyer's ability to object to encroachments, easement conflicts, parking reductions, or setback violations.
- **Mitigation**: Negotiate a tight Permitted Exceptions definition and conduct thorough title and survey review within the objection period.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Retail**: REAs and OEAs are often the most significant Permitted Exceptions. Review each in detail for co-tenancy triggers, exclusive-use restrictions, and operating covenants.
- **Industrial**: Environmental use restrictions and deed restrictions are common. Ensure compliance with intended use.
- **Office**: Parking easements and shared lobby/elevator agreements are critical.
- **Multifamily**: Condominium declarations, affordable housing covenants, and regulatory agreements may be Permitted Exceptions that significantly affect operations.
- **Data centers**: Right-of-way and utility easements are critical to operations. Ensure no easement permits activities that could interfere with data center operations (e.g., excavation near fiber lines).

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: The NY Checklist defines Permitted Exceptions to include "rights of tenants and occupants of the property; recorded covenants, restrictions, and easements (including utility easements); the title company's standard policy jacket exclusions and exceptions from coverage; and such other title or survey exceptions as the purchaser expressly approves." This is more permissive than preferred; negotiate to remove the blanket inclusion of recorded covenants and restrictions.
- **All jurisdictions**: Permitted Exceptions should be jurisdiction-specific to the extent that local law creates unique title issues (e.g., Native American land claims in certain Western states, water rights in Colorado, mineral rights in Texas and North Dakota).

## 7. Survey Requirements

### Preferred Position
Buyer should have the right to obtain, at Buyer's expense, a new or updated ALTA/NSPS survey. Seller should deliver any existing surveys within 5 business days of the Effective Date and cooperate with the surveyor's access to the Property.

**Survey specifications:**
- ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey (current standards, updated 2021)
- Certified to Buyer, Buyer's lender, and the title company
- Prepared by a licensed surveyor in the state where the Property is located
- Include all applicable Table A optional items, particularly:
  - Item 1: Monuments placed (or a note if not placed)
  - Item 2: Address(es) of the Property
  - Item 3: Flood zone classification with community and panel information
  - Item 4: Gross land area
  - Item 5: Vertical relief (if applicable)
  - Item 6(a): Setback lines from recorded documents
  - Item 6(b): Setback lines from applicable zoning
  - Item 7(a) and (b)(1): Building locations, heights, and exterior dimensions
  - Item 8: Parking areas and counts
  - Item 9: Indication of access to public rights-of-way
  - Item 10(a): Utilities observed on site
  - Item 11(a) and (b): Location of utilities from record documents and observed evidence
  - Item 13: Names of adjoining owners (from tax records)
  - Item 14: Plottable easements and encroachments
  - Item 16: Location of wetlands (if applicable)
  - Item 17: Location of improvements within the exterior walls of principal buildings
  - Item 18: Observable evidence of earth-moving work, building construction, or building additions
  - Item 19: Substantial features observed (e.g., parking structures, retaining walls, fences)
  - Item 20: Governmental agency survey-related requirements

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Seller's obligation to deliver existing surveys**: All forms reviewed require Seller to provide existing surveys (UNICO Buyer/Seller Side, Section 4.2: within 5 business days). This is standard.
2. **Buyer's right to update or obtain new survey**: This is uniformly at Buyer's option and expense. No negotiation needed -- Seller will not pay for a new survey.
3. **Seller cooperation**: Seller should cooperate with the surveyor's access to the Property and should not unreasonably restrict the surveyor's activities (UNICO Seller Side, Section 4.2: "Seller, if requested, will cooperate with Purchaser's efforts to obtain an Updated Survey").
4. **Survey as condition to extended coverage**: The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 4.5) explicitly conditions extended title insurance coverage on receipt of a satisfactory survey, and provides that if Buyer fails to arrange for a survey, Buyer must accept standard coverage. This is a reasonable allocation of risk to Buyer.
5. **Survey certification**: Ensure the survey is certified to all relevant parties. The ASB/UNICO Detailed form requires the survey to be addressed to both Purchaser and Seller.
6. **Dual originals**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form requires Buyer to deliver two originals of the updated survey to Seller. This is a reasonable request.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "Buyer's failure to obtain a survey does not extend the Closing Date." **Response**: This is reasonable (UNICO Seller Side, Section 4.2). Buyer should arrange the survey promptly after signing.
- **Seller pushback**: "Buyer's failure to obtain a survey is not a failure of condition." **Response**: This is also reasonable -- the survey is for Buyer's benefit. However, ensure that Buyer can still obtain extended coverage if the survey is delivered to the title company before Closing, even if late.
- **Seller pushback**: "Limit surveyor access to non-tenant areas." **Response**: Resist -- the surveyor may need access to tenant spaces to measure building dimensions and identify interior improvements.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk**: Failure to obtain a timely survey could result in Buyer accepting standard (rather than extended) coverage, which leaves survey-related matters as exceptions.
- **Mitigation**: Order the survey immediately upon signing. ALTA/NSPS surveys can take 2-4 weeks for complex properties; do not wait until the end of the due diligence period.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: Table A Item 8 (parking) and Item 19 (substantial features including loading docks, truck courts, rail spurs) are critical.
- **Retail**: Table A Item 8 (parking count) is essential for verifying compliance with lease-required parking ratios and zoning minimums.
- **Office**: Table A Item 7 (building dimensions and heights) and Item 17 (interior improvements) are important for verifying rentable/usable area calculations.
- **Multifamily**: Unit count verification and amenity locations.
- **Data centers**: Table A Items 10 and 11 (utilities) are critical. Also consider requesting fiber route mapping if not shown on standard survey.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **All jurisdictions**: ALTA/NSPS standards are national, but local practice varies. In some states (e.g., Texas), the survey must be prepared in accordance with state-specific minimum technical standards in addition to ALTA/NSPS.
- **Flood zones**: Item 3 (flood zone classification) is essential nationwide. Verify FEMA panel numbers and effective dates.

## 8. Survey Objection Mechanics

### Preferred Position
Survey objections should be handled on the same timeline as title objections, through a unified or parallel process. Buyer should have the right to object to any survey matter that is not a Permitted Exception within the same Title Objection Date applicable to the title commitment.

The Meadows form (Section 1.2) bundles title and survey objections: "Buyer, by giving notice to Seller on or before [the Title Objection Date], may object to any title exception in the Preliminary Report **or any matter shown on the Survey**." This is the preferred approach -- a single consolidated objection process.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Unified vs. separate process**: A unified process is simpler and preferred. If the survey is not available by the Title Objection Date, negotiate an extension of the objection period for survey matters (or a separate survey objection deadline tied to receipt of the survey).
2. **Scope of survey objections**: Buyer should be able to object to:
   - Encroachments (improvements crossing boundary lines or easement areas)
   - Setback violations
   - Gaps and gores
   - Overlapping boundaries with adjacent parcels
   - Access issues (lack of direct access to public right-of-way)
   - Easement locations that conflict with intended use
   - Flood zone issues
   - Parking shortfalls
3. **Seller's cure obligation for survey matters**: Mirror the title cure framework. Seller elects to cure or not; if not, Buyer may terminate or waive.
4. **Updated survey revealing new matters**: If the Updated Survey reveals matters not shown on the Existing Survey or the title commitment, Buyer should have fresh objection rights. The gap/supplemental update provisions should cover survey-revealed matters.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "Survey matters are physical conditions, not title defects; Buyer should address them during physical due diligence." **Response**: Many survey matters (encroachments, easement violations) are title-related. Maintain the right to object through the title process.
- **Seller pushback**: "If Buyer fails to order a survey by X date, Buyer waives survey objections." **Response**: Accept a reasonable deadline for ordering the survey but preserve objection rights once the survey is received.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk**: PSAs that classify survey matters as part of the general due diligence contingency (which expires) rather than as title matters (which may have independent objection rights). If the survey arrives after the diligence period, Buyer has no remedy.
- **Mitigation**: Order the survey immediately upon signing. Tie survey objection rights to receipt of the survey, not to the due diligence deadline.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: Truck court and loading dock encroachments into easement areas are common. Shared access roads with adjacent parcels may create boundary disputes.
- **Office**: Building overhang or underground parking encroachments are possible.
- **Retail**: Parking area encroachments and cross-easement locations are critical.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant jurisdictional variation. Survey objection mechanics are contract-driven in all states.

---

## 9. Title Insurance Requirements

### Preferred Position
Buyer should be entitled to receive, at Closing, an **ALTA 2006 Owner's Policy of Title Insurance** with **extended coverage**, dated as of the Closing Date, in the amount of the Purchase Price, insuring fee simple title vested in Buyer subject only to the Permitted Exceptions (see UNICO Buyer Side, Section 4.5).

**Extended coverage** removes the standard printed exceptions for:
- Rights or claims of parties in possession not shown by the public records
- Easements or claims of easements not shown by the public records
- Encroachments, overlaps, boundary line disputes, or other matters that would be disclosed by a survey
- Any lien for services, labor, or material not shown by the public records

**Required endorsements** (negotiate during due diligence; confirm availability with title company):
- Comprehensive/ALTA 9.0 (restrictions, encroachments, minerals)
- Zoning 3.1 (with parking)
- Access (insured access to public road)
- Contiguity (if multiple parcels)
- Survey (removing survey exception)
- Tax parcel (insuring correct tax parcel identification)
- Environmental protection lien
- Subdivision compliance
- Same-as survey (legal description matches survey)
- Non-imputation (if Buyer is an entity)
- Fairway (insuring against loss from exercise of surface rights by mineral owner)
- Location (ALTA 22 -- insuring address)
- Utility access
- Owner's comprehensive (ALTA 9.3 -- covenants, conditions, restrictions)
- Aggregation endorsement (if portfolio deal with multiple parcels)

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Extended vs. standard coverage**: Buyer should always require extended coverage. The UNICO Buyer Side form mandates it (Section 4.5). The UNICO Seller Side form leaves it to Buyer's election but conditions extended coverage on Buyer's delivery of a satisfactory survey (Section 4.5). Push for mandatory extended coverage.
2. **Owner's title affidavit**: Seller must execute and deliver an owner's title affidavit to enable the title company to issue extended coverage and delete the standard exceptions (UNICO Buyer/Seller Side, Section 4.5). This is non-negotiable.
3. **Premium allocation**:
   - Standard: Seller pays the standard coverage premium; Buyer pays the incremental cost of extended coverage and endorsements (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.6.2; PSA Seller income property, Section 11.3).
   - Preferred: Seller pays the full owner's policy premium (standard + extended); Buyer pays for endorsements only.
   - Market depends on jurisdiction and leverage.
4. **Endorsement availability**: Not all endorsements are available in all states (e.g., zoning endorsements are not available in every jurisdiction). Confirm availability early in diligence.
5. **Closing condition**: The title company's willingness and readiness to issue the Title Policy should be an express **condition precedent** to Buyer's obligation to close (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 10.1.2: "The Title Company shall be irrevocably committed and ready, willing and able to issue the Title Policy"). Do not allow Seller to weaken this to "reasonable efforts."
6. **Endorsements not a condition**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form (Section 4.1(f)) states that Buyer's inability to obtain desired endorsements does not relieve Buyer of its closing obligation or entitle Buyer to a purchase price reduction. This is a significant Seller protection -- push back if possible, or at minimum, confirm endorsement availability during due diligence.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "Buyer pays entire title insurance premium." **Fallback**: Standard market is Seller pays standard coverage premium. If Seller insists Buyer pays all, seek a corresponding concession elsewhere.
- **Seller pushback**: "Endorsement availability is not a condition to closing." **Fallback**: Accept, but conduct thorough endorsement availability review during due diligence. If a critical endorsement is not available, address during diligence and either resolve or exercise diligence termination right.
- **Seller pushback**: "Seller will not provide an owner's title affidavit." **Response**: This is extremely unusual and should be rejected. Without the affidavit, the title company cannot delete standard exceptions or issue extended coverage.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk**: Accepting standard coverage only. Standard coverage leaves Buyer exposed to unrecorded easements, encroachments, and parties in possession -- all common issues in commercial real estate.
- **High risk**: Failure to obtain critical endorsements (zoning, access, contiguity). These endorsements provide essential coverage beyond the base policy.
- **Mitigation**: Confirm endorsement availability with the title company during the first week of due diligence. If any critical endorsement is not available, raise during title objection process.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office**: Zoning 3.1 (with parking) and access endorsements are essential.
- **Retail**: ALTA 9.0/9.3 (restrictions) endorsement is critical for REA compliance.
- **Industrial**: Environmental protection lien endorsement and access endorsement are important.
- **Multifamily**: Subdivision/condominium endorsement if applicable.
- **Data centers**: Utility access endorsement and, in some cases, a mineral rights endorsement (Fairway) are important, particularly in states where mineral rights are severed from surface rights.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Texas**: Title insurance rates are promulgated by the Texas Department of Insurance. Endorsement availability and pricing are standardized.
- **New York**: Title insurance is regulated. Certain endorsements (e.g., zoning) are available through major underwriters but may require specific forms.
- **California**: CLTA (California Land Title Association) forms may be used in addition to or instead of ALTA forms. Ensure the PSA specifies ALTA 2006 form.
- **Florida**: Title insurance is regulated with promulgated rates. Customarily, the seller pays for the owner's policy in most Florida counties (opposite of many other states).

## 10. Voluntary Exceptions Created by Seller After the Effective Date

### Preferred Position
Seller should be **prohibited** from creating, permitting, or consenting to any new exceptions to title after the Effective Date without Buyer's prior written consent. Any exception created in violation of this prohibition should be a mandatory cure item -- Seller must remove it at or before Closing regardless of cost.

This covenant is typically found in the Seller's covenants section (not the title section), but it is functionally a title provision:
- "Seller shall not...subject the property to any liens, encumbrances, covenants, restrictions, or easements" (NY Checklist, Seller Covenants).
- "Between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, Seller shall...not execute any new lease or any contract affecting the Real Property or amend, modify, renew, extend or terminate any of the Leases, the Contracts or the Permits in any material respect without the prior approval of Buyer" (Meadows, Section 6.1).

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Scope of prohibition**: Should cover all voluntary acts by Seller that would affect title: new easements, new liens, new CC&R amendments, new leases (which create possessory interests), and new service contracts that run with the land.
2. **Emergency exception**: Seller may negotiate an exception for contracts entered into in response to emergencies (e.g., emergency roof repair), provided such contracts are terminable on 30 days' notice (Meadows, Section 6.1). This is a reasonable concession.
3. **Leasing activity**: During the contract period, Seller will need to continue leasing the Property. Require Buyer's prior consent for new leases and material amendments, but do not unreasonably withhold consent. After diligence expiration, Buyer should be more actively involved in leasing decisions.
4. **Consequence of violation**: If Seller creates a voluntary exception without Buyer's consent, it should be treated as a mandatory cure item **and** a breach of Seller's covenants, entitling Buyer to terminate and recover the earnest money plus out-of-pocket costs.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "Seller needs flexibility to manage the Property during the contract period." **Fallback**: Allow Seller to enter into routine matters (maintenance contracts terminable on 30 days' notice) without consent, but require consent for anything affecting title.
- **Seller pushback**: "New leases entered into with Buyer's consent should be Permitted Exceptions." **Response**: Yes, this is standard. Any lease entered into with Buyer's consent should be added to the Permitted Exceptions.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk**: Seller granting a new easement to an adjacent landowner during the contract period. This is rare but possible, particularly in development contexts.
- **Medium risk**: Seller entering into a long-term service contract that encumbers the Property (e.g., a solar lease, cell tower lease).
- **Mitigation**: Include specific language in the covenants section prohibiting Seller from creating new title exceptions without consent.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Development sites**: Higher risk. Seller may be seeking entitlements, entering into development agreements, or granting utility easements during the contract period.
- **Operating assets**: Lower risk, but watch for new cell tower leases, solar leases, or signage easements.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant jurisdictional variation. This is a contract-driven provision.

---

## 11. Title Company Selection

### Preferred Position
Buyer should have the right to select the title company, subject to the company being a nationally recognized title insurance underwriter (Fidelity National Title, First American, Chicago Title, Stewart Title, or Old Republic). In practice, the title company is often selected by agreement of the parties, and the title company frequently also serves as the escrow agent.

The UNICO forms identify the title company by name, address, and contact in the definitions section (Section 1.12 Buyer Side / Section 1.10 Seller Side). The ASB/UNICO Detailed form specifies "Fidelity National Title Insurance Company" as both the Title Company and the Escrow Agent.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Buyer's lender requirements**: Buyer's lender may require the use of a specific title company or underwriter. Preserve Buyer's ability to designate the title company (or a co-insurer) acceptable to its lender.
2. **Simultaneous issue of lender's policy**: If Buyer is obtaining financing, the title company should simultaneously issue a lender's policy (ALTA loan policy) at the reduced simultaneous-issue rate. The NY Checklist includes this as a closing condition.
3. **Escrow agent identity**: If the title company is also the escrow agent, ensure that the escrow provisions (earnest money handling, disbursement conditions) are acceptable.
4. **Local counsel/agent**: In some jurisdictions, a local title agent is required. Ensure the selected underwriter has local agency relationships.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "Seller selects the title company." **Fallback**: Agree to Seller's selection if Buyer's lender will accept the selected company. Alternatively, agree on a mutually acceptable national underwriter.
- **Seller pushback**: "Title company must be the escrow agent." **Response**: This is generally acceptable and is the market standard in most Western states. In New York, the escrow agent is often the seller's attorney; push for a title company or independent escrow agent.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Title company selection is rarely a contentious issue in institutional deals, as all major national underwriters are acceptable to most lenders.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No significant variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: The NY Checklist recommends that the escrow agent be "the purchaser's title insurance company" and "not the seller's attorney." This reflects New York practice, where seller's counsel sometimes holds the deposit.
- **Western states (OR, WA, CO, CA)**: Escrow closing through the title company is standard.
- **Texas**: The title company must be authorized to transact business in Texas; rates are promulgated by the Texas Department of Insurance.

## 12. Simultaneous Issue of Lender's Policy

### Preferred Position
If Buyer is obtaining acquisition financing, the PSA should require that the title company simultaneously issue a lender's title insurance policy (ALTA Loan Policy 2006 form) in favor of Buyer's lender, in the amount of the loan, as a condition to Closing. The simultaneous-issue premium rate is substantially lower than a standalone lender's policy, so timing is important.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Closing condition**: Include the title company's willingness to issue the lender's policy as a condition to Buyer's obligation to close, alongside the owner's policy condition.
2. **Premium allocation**: Buyer typically pays for the lender's policy and any lender-required endorsements. This is standard and generally not negotiated.
3. **Lender's endorsement requirements**: Lenders typically require additional endorsements beyond those in the owner's policy (e.g., revolving credit endorsement, variable rate endorsement, future advance endorsement, tie-in endorsement for multi-site loans). Ensure the PSA does not limit the endorsements Buyer may request.
4. **No financing contingency caveat**: Even though this playbook assumes no financing contingency, the title insurance provisions should still accommodate the lender's policy. The absence of a financing contingency means Buyer bears the risk of not obtaining financing, but the title company must still be prepared to insure the lender.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "Issuance of a lender's policy is not a condition to closing." **Fallback**: This is a tough concession. If Buyer has no financing contingency, Seller will argue that all financing-related matters are Buyer's risk. **Response**: The lender's policy is a title matter, not a financing matter. If the title company will not insure the lender, there is likely a title defect that would also affect the owner's policy. Argue that if the title company is willing to issue the owner's policy but not the lender's policy, Buyer should still be permitted to close.
- **Seller pushback**: "Buyer may not delay closing to accommodate lender's policy requirements." **Response**: Concede that Buyer may not delay closing solely for lender's endorsements, but preserve the right to delay if the title company identifies a substantive title issue affecting both the owner's and lender's policies.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk**: In practice, if the title company will issue the owner's policy, it will almost always issue the simultaneous lender's policy. The risk is primarily in timing -- if the lender requires unusual endorsements that take time to arrange.
- **Mitigation**: Provide the lender's title requirements to the title company early in diligence.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No significant variation. Lender's policy requirements are loan-driven, not asset-driven.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **All jurisdictions**: Simultaneous-issue rates are available nationwide from all major underwriters. Ensure the lender's requirements for state-specific endorsements are identified early.

---

## 13. Deed Type

### Preferred Position
Buyer should require a **special warranty deed** (also called a "limited warranty deed" or "covenant deed" in some jurisdictions) that warrants title against claims arising **by, through, or under Seller** but not against all claims generally. This is the institutional market standard for commercial real estate.

All forms reviewed use the special warranty deed:
- UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.4.1: "One Special Warranty Deed...duly executed and acknowledged by Seller, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E."
- UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.4.1: Same.
- ASB/UNICO Detailed: Exhibit F, Special Warranty Deed form.
- Meadows, Section 4.1: "Seller shall convey to Buyer fee title to the Real Property by a duly executed and acknowledged special warranty deed."
- PSA Seller (income property), Section 4(c): "Seller shall convey to Buyer fee simple title to the Real Property and Improvements by special warranty deed."

**Deed form considerations:**
- The deed should be in recordable form, pre-approved by the title company.
- The legal description in the deed should match the title commitment and survey.
- The deed should be "subject to" only the Permitted Exceptions (listed on an attached schedule).
- The deed should include appropriate transfer tax declarations as required by the applicable jurisdiction.
- The deed should contain a non-merger provision (or reference the PSA's non-merger clause) preserving Seller's representations and warranties post-closing.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Special warranty vs. general warranty**: In institutional deals, special warranty is universally accepted. General warranty deeds are more common in residential transactions. Do not insist on a general warranty deed -- it creates an unreasonable ongoing obligation for Seller and will be rejected.
2. **Special warranty vs. quitclaim**: Never accept a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed provides no warranties whatsoever and is appropriate only for corrective conveyances or inter-family transfers.
3. **New York practice**: In New York, the standard is a **bargain and sale deed with covenants against grantor's acts**, which is functionally equivalent to a special warranty deed. The NY Checklist specifies this form and requires a "lien law clause" (see Jurisdictional Notes).
4. **Deed restrictions**: Resist Seller's attempts to include deed restrictions or releases of Seller in the deed. The NY Checklist warns: "Resist seller attempts to include deed restrictions or releases of the seller."
5. **Non-merger clause**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form includes a non-merger provision in the deed itself: "Nothing in this Deed shall prevent Grantee from relying on any representations and warranties...that, under the terms of the Agreement, expressly survive the delivery of this Deed." This is essential and should be included in all deeds (or referenced in the PSA's non-merger section -- see UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.18).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "Deed should contain a broad release of Seller." **Response**: Reject. The deed should contain only the conveyance and the Seller's warranty against claims arising under Seller. Any release language belongs in the PSA's "as-is" provisions, not in the deed.
- **Seller pushback**: "No non-merger clause in the deed." **Fallback**: Include the non-merger clause in the PSA instead (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.18). However, the deed-level non-merger clause is preferable because it survives recording and is enforceable even if the PSA is not recorded.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: The special warranty deed is market standard, and this provision is rarely contentious.
- **Medium risk**: Failure to include a non-merger clause could result in Seller arguing that its representations and warranties merged into the deed at closing (the common law doctrine of merger). Always include non-merger language.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No significant variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: Bargain and sale deed with covenants against grantor's acts is the standard. Must include a lien law clause (Section 13 of the Lien Law). Title company pre-approval is required.
- **California**: Grant deed is the standard form (equivalent to a special warranty deed). The word "grant" in a California deed implies certain statutory covenants.
- **Colorado**: Special warranty deed is standard. The ASB/UNICO Detailed form uses a Colorado special warranty deed.
- **Oregon**: Special warranty deed is the standard form for commercial transactions.
- **Washington**: Special warranty deed is standard. The PSA Seller (income property) form (Washington property) uses this form.
- **Illinois**: Special warranty deed is standard in commercial transactions; in residential, warranty deeds are more common.
- **Texas**: Special warranty deed is standard. Must comply with Texas Property Code requirements.

## 14. Title Objection Response Timelines

### Preferred Position
The complete title objection/response/election cycle should follow this timeline:

| Step | Action | Deadline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Seller delivers Title Commitment + Title Documents | Title Commitment Delivery Date (5 BD after Effective Date, or as specified) |
| 2 | Buyer delivers Title Objection Notice | Title Objection Date (X BD after later of receipt of commitment or Effective Date) |
| 3 | Seller delivers cure election notice | 5 BD after receipt of Buyer's objection notice |
| 4 | Buyer elects to terminate or waive (if Seller declines to cure) | 5 BD after Seller's election not to cure |
| 5 | For gap/supplemental matters: Buyer delivers New Title Objection | 5 BD after receipt of amended commitment |
| 6 | Seller delivers cure election for new matters | 5 BD after receipt of Buyer's new objection |
| 7 | Buyer elects to terminate or waive (for new matters) | 5 BD after Seller's election not to cure new matters |

**Total minimum cycle (initial): Steps 1-4 = ~20-25 business days from Effective Date**
**Gap cycle: Steps 5-7 = 15 business days from receipt of update**

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Business days vs. calendar days**: Always use business days. Calendar days can result in deadlines falling on weekends or holidays.
2. **Symmetry of response periods**: The UNICO Buyer Side form gives Seller the sooner of 5 BD after receipt or 3 BD prior to the Due Diligence Deadline. This compressed timeline is Seller-favorable. Push for a flat 5 BD response period.
3. **Deemed elections**: Both forms use deemed election provisions:
   - UNICO Seller Side: If Seller does not respond within the Seller Title Response Period, Buyer may terminate. (Seller's silence is neutral -- Buyer must elect.)
   - ASB/UNICO Detailed: If Seller fails to give notice, "Seller shall be deemed to have elected not to attempt to Remove." (Seller's silence = deemed election not to cure.)
   - The latter is preferred from Buyer's perspective.
4. **Closing Date extension**: For gap matters, the Closing Date should automatically extend to accommodate the objection/response/election cycle (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 4.4).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "Shorten all response periods to 3 business days." **Fallback**: 3 BD may be acceptable for Seller's response (Step 3) and Buyer's election (Step 4) if the initial objection period (Step 2) is adequate. The key is total cycle time.
- **Seller pushback**: "No Closing Date extension for gap matters." **Response**: This is unacceptable. Without the extension, the gap objection process is meaningless if new matters appear close to Closing.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk**: Compressed timelines that do not allow adequate review. Complex title issues (e.g., unresolved mechanic's lien, boundary dispute) require more than 3 business days to evaluate.
- **Mitigation**: Calendar all deadlines at signing and monitor actively.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No significant variation. Timeline considerations apply equally across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant jurisdictional variation in timeline mechanics. These are contract-driven provisions.

---

## 15. Deemed Waiver Provisions

### Preferred Position
Deemed waiver provisions (where Buyer's failure to timely object or terminate is treated as approval or waiver) are inherent in the title review process and cannot be entirely eliminated. The key is to ensure that:
1. The triggering event for each deemed waiver is clear and unambiguous.
2. The time periods are adequate for meaningful review.
3. Buyer's counsel has a clear calendar of all deadlines.

**Standard deemed waiver provisions in the reviewed forms:**
- Buyer's failure to timely object to Exceptions = deemed approval of all unobjected Exceptions as Permitted Exceptions (all forms).
- Buyer's failure to terminate within the election period after Seller declines to cure = deemed waiver of the objection (all forms).
- Buyer's failure to object to supplemental/gap matters within 5 BD = deemed approval of new exception as Permitted Exception (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 4.4; PSA Seller income property, Section 4(b)).

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Notice requirement**: Deemed waiver provisions should be accompanied by a requirement that the document triggering the waiver period (title commitment, Seller's response, supplemental report) is actually delivered to Buyer in writing. No deemed waiver should be triggered by a document Buyer has not received.
2. **Mandatory cure items excluded from deemed waiver**: Even if Buyer fails to timely object, mandatory cure items (monetary liens, Seller-created encumbrances) should **never** become Permitted Exceptions through deemed waiver. The UNICO Buyer/Seller Side forms accomplish this by carving out categories (x), (y), and (z) from the deemed approval mechanism.
3. **Affirmative notice vs. failure to terminate**: Determine whether the PSA requires Buyer to **affirmatively approve** (in which case silence preserves Buyer's rights) or requires Buyer to **affirmatively terminate** (in which case silence = waiver). The latter is more common and more dangerous for Buyer. The NY Checklist flags this distinction: "Confirm whether: the purchaser must affirmatively elect to proceed...or the transaction proceeds unless the purchaser expressly elects to terminate."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "Buyer's silence = approval." **Response**: This is market for initial title objections and gap matters. Accept it, but ensure adequate time periods and clear triggering events.
- **Seller pushback**: "No carve-out for mandatory cure items." **Response**: This is a red line. Monetary liens and Seller-created encumbrances must never become Permitted Exceptions through Buyer's failure to act.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk**: Missed deadlines resulting in inadvertent waiver of significant title objections.
- **Mitigation**: Implement a robust calendaring system. Assign primary and backup responsibility for each title-related deadline. Consider building in a 1-day early internal deadline to allow for review before the contractual deadline.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No variation. This is a procedural matter common to all asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant jurisdictional variation. Deemed waiver provisions are contract-driven.

---

## 16. Right to Update Title and Survey Pre-Closing

### Preferred Position
Buyer should have an express right to obtain updated title commitments and surveys at any time prior to Closing, with full objection rights to any new matters revealed. This right should be independent of the due diligence period.

The PSA Seller (income property) form (Section 4(b)) provides: "Seller shall cause the Title Company to provide to Buyer supplemental reports to the Commitment (together with copies of any instruments constituting exceptions which are identified therein) covering any additions or deletions from the date of the Commitment through the Closing Date."

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Seller's obligation to cooperate**: Seller should be required to cooperate with Buyer's request for title updates, including executing any additional affidavits or documents required by the title company.
2. **Cost allocation**: Buyer typically pays for updated surveys. Title commitment updates are typically at no additional cost (the title company includes them as part of the standard commitment service). If additional searches are required, the cost allocation should be specified.
3. **Timing of updates**: Buyer should request a bring-down search or updated commitment at least 5-10 business days before the scheduled Closing Date. The title company will typically perform a "gap search" as part of its standard closing procedures.
4. **Objection rights preserved**: Any new matters revealed by updates should be subject to the gap/supplemental objection process described in Section 5 above.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller pushback**: "No obligation to cooperate with pre-closing updates." **Response**: This is unreasonable and should be rejected. Seller's cooperation (e.g., providing updated affidavits) is necessary for the title company to issue the policy at closing.
- **Seller pushback**: "Updates may not delay closing." **Fallback**: Accept, provided that Buyer retains objection rights to new matters with automatic Closing Date extensions as provided in the gap objection provisions.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk**: Failure to obtain a pre-closing title update could result in Buyer acquiring title subject to liens or encumbrances that appeared after the initial commitment.
- **Mitigation**: Standard title company practice includes a gap search before closing. Ensure this is contractually required, not merely customary.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Development/construction**: Higher risk of new mechanic's liens. Request a construction lien search within 5 business days of Closing in addition to the standard gap search.
- **Operating assets**: Standard gap search is typically sufficient.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: Gap coverage is provided through the title company's "date-down" endorsement.
- **All jurisdictions**: Standard title company practice includes a gap search. The PSA should contractually require it to remove any doubt.
