# Default and Remedies -- Buyer Side Playbook

This playbook addresses the full spectrum of default and remedies provisions from the buyer/purchaser's perspective in institutional commercial real estate PSAs ($50M+ transactions). All positions, fallbacks, and negotiation strategies are oriented toward maximizing buyer protections while acknowledging market realities.

---

## 1. Seller Default -- Buyer's Right to Specific Performance

### Preferred Position
Buyer's primary remedy for seller default must be an unconditional right to specific performance of the PSA, without time limitations on when the action must be commenced and without preconditions beyond the seller's actual default. This is the single most critical buyer protection in the default article.

Preferred language should provide:
- Buyer may elect specific performance as a matter of right, not subject to seller's consent or any cure period beyond a minimal notice period
- No deadline to commence the specific performance action (or, at minimum, a generous deadline of 120+ days)
- Right to recover all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, attorneys' fees, and court costs incurred in connection with the specific performance action
- Carve-out for willful/intentional breach: if seller willfully defaults, buyer has the right to pursue both specific performance AND actual damages (including consequential damages)
- Right to record a lis pendens against the property immediately upon filing the specific performance action

**Cross-reference: UNICO Buyer Side (Section 13.1)** -- This form provides the strongest buyer position among the precedents, granting specific performance plus recovery of "any and all damages arising out of such intentional or willful default" where the seller's breach was intentional. It also includes a "Seller Breakage Fee" (capped at the Earnest Money Deposit amount) if buyer elects termination instead of specific performance, covering due diligence costs, financing costs, opportunity costs, and attorneys' fees.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **No short-fuse deadline to commence action.** The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 13.1) imposes a 60-day deadline for buyer to commence a specific performance action after becoming aware of seller's default. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 10.3) imposes a 20-day deadline. The Meadows form requires filing suit within a specified number of days after the Closing Date. These deadlines are dangerous -- buyer's counsel may need time to assess the situation, attempt informal resolution, and prepare the complaint. Push for no deadline or, at minimum, 120 days.
2. **Willful breach carve-out from sole-remedy limitation.** Even if the PSA frames specific performance as buyer's "sole and exclusive remedy," insist on a carve-out for willful or intentional breach that unlocks full actual damages. This is critical where seller deliberately sells the property to a third party (anticipatory repudiation). See UNICO Buyer Side Section 13.1 language.
3. **Recovery of enforcement costs.** Even forms that provide specific performance often fail to address cost recovery. Insist that if buyer prevails in a specific performance action, seller reimburses all reasonable attorneys' fees, expert costs, and litigation expenses.
4. **No waiver of lis pendens.** The Meadows form includes a buyer waiver of the right to record a lis pendens. This is an extreme seller-protective provision and should be struck in every case. Without a lis pendens, seller can convey to a bona fide purchaser for value, rendering specific performance unavailable.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller argues specific performance makes the property unmarketable during litigation.** Response: That is precisely the point -- it prevents seller from selling to a third party. Offer to post a bond or agree to expedited dispute resolution procedures.
- **Seller demands a short deadline (20-60 days) to commence action.** Fallback chain: (1) No deadline; (2) 180 days; (3) 120 days; (4) 90 days -- but no shorter. Below 90 days, the right is illusory for complex transactions with multiple stakeholders and counsel.
- **Seller demands buyer waive lis pendens rights.** This is a hard no in almost all circumstances. If absolutely forced to concede (rare), require that the PSA include an express acknowledgment that the property will not be conveyed to any third party during the cure period, with a liquidated damages amount payable by seller if seller breaches this covenant.
- **Seller offers termination + deposit return as buyer's only remedy (no specific performance).** Fallback chain: (1) Full specific performance + damages for willful breach; (2) Specific performance OR termination + deposit return + Seller Breakage Fee (UNICO Buyer Side model); (3) Specific performance OR termination + deposit return + reimbursement of Purchaser's Costs (defined term covering title, survey, engineering, environmental, legal fees -- see IL Pro-Buyer Section 18.02); (4) Termination + deposit return + uncapped actual out-of-pocket damages (last resort before conceding specific performance entirely).

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk:** Losing specific performance entirely. If buyer can only terminate and recover the deposit, buyer has no leverage if the property appreciates or if a competing buyer offers more. Seller can breach with impunity, pay back the deposit, and sell to the higher bidder.
- **Medium risk:** Short deadlines to commence specific performance actions. These create a trap for the unwary and may result in waiver by operation of the deadline even if buyer had every intention to pursue the remedy.
- **Low risk:** Reasonable limitations on cost recovery (e.g., cap on attorneys' fees). Annoying but manageable.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Data Centers / Mission-Critical Facilities:** Specific performance is even more essential because replacement properties with equivalent power, fiber, and cooling infrastructure are extremely scarce. Push harder to preserve this remedy and to extend filing deadlines.
- **Multifamily:** In hot markets with rapid price appreciation, specific performance is critical because the opportunity cost of losing the deal is high and comparable properties may not be available at comparable pricing.
- **Office (Value-Add/Repositioning):** If buyer has already invested significant capital in pre-closing planning, zoning, or entitlement work, emphasize the need for both specific performance and a robust Purchaser's Costs reimbursement provision.
- **Industrial/Logistics:** Given the severe supply constraints in institutional-grade logistics assets, specific performance should be treated as non-negotiable.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** Specific performance is generally available for real property transactions, but courts require that the property is "unique" (which real property generally is). However, NY courts may deny specific performance where the buyer has an adequate remedy at law or where enforcement would be inequitable. The NY Checklist (Practical Law) confirms that negotiating for specific performance is standard purchaser practice.
- **Illinois:** IL courts freely grant specific performance for real property transactions. The IL Pro-Buyer form (Section 18.02) provides specific performance plus, in the case of willful default where specific performance is unavailable (e.g., seller already conveyed to a third party), reimbursement of Purchaser's Costs. This is a strong fallback model.
- **California:** Specific performance is a statutory right under Cal. Civ. Code Section 3384 et seq. for breach of contract to convey real property. However, note that Cal. Civ. Code Section 3389 provides that specific performance cannot be enforced against a party who has not received adequate consideration. Ensure the PSA recites adequate consideration.
- **Oregon:** The Meadows form (Oregon-governed) attempts to force buyer waiver of lis pendens and impose a filing deadline. Oregon courts generally follow the rule that real property is unique and specific performance is available, but contractual limitations will be enforced.
- **Texas:** Texas courts are generally willing to grant specific performance for real property, but the remedy is discretionary. Contractual provisions preserving specific performance are enforceable and advisable.
- **Colorado / Massachusetts:** The Detailed Seller Side form (governed by Massachusetts law with Colorado venue) imposes a 20-day deadline to commence specific performance. Both states recognize specific performance for real property, but the extremely short contractual deadline would likely be enforced.

## 2. Seller Default -- Buyer's Right to Terminate and Recover Deposit

### Preferred Position
As an alternative to specific performance, buyer should always have the unqualified right to terminate the PSA upon seller default and recover:
- The full Earnest Money Deposit plus all accrued interest
- A "Seller Breakage Fee" or "Purchaser's Costs" reimbursement covering all actual out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with the transaction
- Ideally, the Seller Breakage Fee should be uncapped, but at minimum should be capped at no less than the Earnest Money Deposit amount

**Cross-reference: UNICO Buyer Side (Section 13.1)** -- Provides for return of the Earnest Money Deposit plus a "Seller Breakage Fee" consisting of buyer's due diligence costs, financing costs, costs of foregoing other business opportunities, and attorneys' fees, capped at the Earnest Money Deposit amount.

**Cross-reference: IL Pro-Buyer (Section 18.02(a))** -- Provides for return of the Earnest Money Deposit with interest, plus (for willful default) reimbursement of "Purchaser's Costs" defined as title/survey/municipal search costs, engineering/environmental report fees, and all actual reasonable third-party negotiation and due diligence costs including attorneys' fees.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Scope of reimbursable costs.** Push for the broadest possible definition. The UNICO Buyer Side form is the strongest precedent, expressly including "costs of foregoing other business opportunities" -- an element approaching lost-profits recovery. At minimum, include: (a) title and survey costs, (b) environmental and engineering reports, (c) legal fees, (d) lender fees and rate-lock costs, (e) travel and personnel costs, (f) third-party consultant fees.
2. **Cap on Seller Breakage Fee.** If seller insists on a cap, negotiate it at the highest possible level. The UNICO Buyer Side form caps the Seller Breakage Fee at the Earnest Money Deposit amount (typically 1-3% of Purchase Price for institutional deals). Push for a higher cap -- 5% of Purchase Price if possible. Fallback: 3% of Purchase Price. Hard floor: 1% of Purchase Price.
3. **Timing of deposit return.** Specify that the deposit must be returned "promptly" or within a defined short period (5-10 business days) after buyer's termination notice. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 10.3) conditions deposit return on buyer's compliance with post-termination obligations (e.g., return of confidential information). Push back on any preconditions to deposit return beyond the termination notice itself.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller offers deposit return only, no cost reimbursement.** This is the UNICO Seller Side position (Section 13.1) and the Seller Income Property form. Fallback chain: (1) Deposit return + uncapped cost reimbursement; (2) Deposit return + cost reimbursement capped at Earnest Money Deposit; (3) Deposit return + cost reimbursement capped at 50% of Earnest Money Deposit; (4) Deposit return only (absolute floor -- but pair with robust specific performance right).
- **Seller conditions deposit return on buyer performing post-termination obligations.** Accept only minimal, objectively determinable conditions (e.g., return of due diligence materials). Reject subjective conditions or conditions that could delay return indefinitely.
- **Seller argues cost reimbursement is a penalty and unenforceable.** Response: Reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket costs is compensatory, not punitive. It does not constitute liquidated damages and is not subject to LD analysis.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk:** Accepting deposit return as buyer's only remedy with no specific performance right. Seller can breach with impunity and buyer's only recovery is the deposit it already tendered.
- **Medium risk:** Accepting a low cap on cost reimbursement. In a $100M+ deal, buyer's out-of-pocket costs (legal, environmental, engineering, lender fees) can easily exceed $500K-$1M.
- **Low risk:** Reasonable timing requirements for deposit return (e.g., 10 business days).

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Data Centers:** Pre-closing costs are disproportionately high (specialized engineering, power studies, connectivity assessments). Push for uncapped cost reimbursement.
- **Multifamily (Development/Conversion):** If buyer has invested in entitlement work, architectural plans, or market studies, the Purchaser's Costs definition must expressly include these categories.
- **Retail (NNN):** Transaction costs tend to be moderate. Standard cap at EMD amount is generally adequate.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York (NY Checklist):** The Practical Law checklist recommends that buyer negotiate reimbursement of title/survey costs, third-party due diligence costs, and legal fees where seller willfully refuses to close and transfers the property to a third party. This is consistent with the general NY practice.
- **All Jurisdictions:** Cost reimbursement provisions (as distinguished from liquidated damages) are generally enforceable because they compensate for actual losses, not estimated damages.

## 3. Buyer Default -- Liquidated Damages / Deposit Forfeiture as Seller's Sole Remedy

### Preferred Position
If buyer defaults, seller's sole and exclusive remedy should be retention of the Earnest Money Deposit as liquidated damages, with an express release of buyer from all further liability. This is the single most important buyer protection against seller overreach. The LD provision should include:

- Express recital that the deposit amount is a reasonable estimate of seller's damages
- Express recital that actual damages would be difficult or impracticable to determine
- Express waiver by seller of any right to seek specific performance against buyer
- Express waiver by seller of any right to seek damages beyond the deposit (including consequential, punitive, special, incidental, and exemplary damages)
- Express release of buyer from all further liability upon forfeiture of the deposit, except for obligations expressly stated to survive termination (typically limited to confidentiality, indemnification for property damage during inspections, and broker commission indemnities)
- Initials lines for both parties confirming the LD provision was negotiated and explained by counsel

**Cross-reference: All seven forms** uniformly provide for deposit forfeiture as seller's sole remedy for buyer default. This is the market standard for institutional commercial real estate transactions. Key differences are in the details.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Sole and exclusive remedy language.** Insist on belt-and-suspenders: "sole and exclusive remedy at law or in equity." The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 10.2) contains the most comprehensive sole-remedy language, supplemented by the statement that the LD provision "is intended only to liquidate and limit Seller's right to damages arising due to Purchaser's failure to purchase the Property" and "shall not limit the other obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement." Monitor this carve-out carefully -- it should be narrowly drawn (see Point 3 below).
2. **Seller waiver of specific performance against buyer.** All forms except the UNICO Seller Side form include an express waiver by seller of the right to seek specific performance against buyer. The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 13.2) includes the waiver. Ensure it is present in any negotiated form.
3. **Carve-outs from the LD/sole remedy limitation.** Acceptable carve-outs: (a) buyer's indemnification obligations for property damage during inspections, (b) buyer's confidentiality obligations, (c) buyer's broker commission representations. Unacceptable carve-outs: (a) any obligation that effectively allows seller to pursue uncapped damages for buyer's failure to close, (b) recording prohibition violations treated as independent default (the Detailed Seller Side form, Section 11.18, provides that recording a memorandum of the PSA constitutes a default entitling seller to retain the deposit -- acceptable if the LD cap still applies).
4. **Deposit amount as proxy for LD cap.** Ensure the deposit amount is appropriate. For institutional deals, the standard range is 1-3% of Purchase Price for the initial deposit (going hard after due diligence) with possible additional deposits. The total at-risk deposit typically ranges from 2-5% of Purchase Price. Resist seller demands for deposits exceeding 5% unless there are extraordinary circumstances.
5. **Initialing/confirmation requirement.** California law effectively requires initialing of LD provisions (Cal. Civ. Code Section 1671). Even in non-California jurisdictions, the initialing requirement demonstrates mutual assent and strengthens enforceability. All precedent forms include this.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller demands the right to sue for actual damages (no LD).** This is a dealbreaker for institutional buyers. Every form in the precedent set uses LD. Response: LD is the universal market standard for institutional CRE transactions. Seller's exposure to market risk after a failed closing is addressed by the deposit amount. Fallback: offer a larger deposit to satisfy seller's concerns, but maintain the LD/sole remedy structure.
- **Seller demands specific performance against buyer.** Resist firmly. If seller can force buyer to close, buyer loses all leverage from remaining contingencies and conditions. Fallback: agree to specific performance only if buyer has expressly and unconditionally waived all contingencies and conditions precedent and is otherwise fully obligated to close (i.e., specific performance becomes available only at the "hard" closing stage, not during any contingency period). This is an extreme fallback.
- **Seller carves out "willful" or "intentional" buyer default from the LD limitation.** This creates enormous ambiguity. What constitutes "willful" default? A buyer that declines to close because its investment committee does not approve the transaction -- is that "willful"? Push back firmly. If forced to concede, define "willful default" very narrowly (e.g., buyer affirmatively communicates in writing that it will not close despite having no legal right to terminate).
- **Seller wants LD plus the right to pursue surviving obligations as actual damages.** Ensure the surviving obligations are narrowly defined and do not include obligations that are effectively duplicative of closing obligations.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk:** Any provision that allows seller to pursue actual damages (beyond the deposit) for buyer's failure to close. This exposes buyer to potentially unlimited liability.
- **High risk:** Broad carve-outs from the LD/sole remedy limitation. Even seemingly innocuous carve-outs (e.g., "buyer's obligations that expressly survive termination") can be weaponized if the survival provisions are broadly drawn.
- **Medium risk:** Deposit amount that is too high relative to deal size. While the deposit is the contractual limit on buyer's exposure, an excessively large deposit (>5% of Purchase Price) ties up capital and increases at-risk exposure disproportionately.
- **Low risk:** Absence of initialing requirement (except in California, where it is legally required).

### Asset-Type Variations
- **All Asset Types:** The LD/sole remedy structure is universal across asset types. Deposit amounts may vary:
  - Office: 1-3% standard
  - Industrial: 1-2% (often lower due to competitive bidding dynamics)
  - Multifamily: 2-3% standard
  - Retail: 2-3% standard
  - Data Center: 3-5% (higher due to specialized nature and longer closing timelines)

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **California:** Cal. Civ. Code Section 1671(b) creates a presumption that LD provisions in commercial real estate contracts are valid unless the party challenging the provision establishes that it was unreasonable under the circumstances existing at the time the contract was made. Initialing is strongly recommended and may be required by local practice.
- **New York:** NY courts enforce LD provisions unless the amount is "plainly or grossly disproportionate to the probable loss" (Truck Rent-A-Center, Inc. v. Purdy Corp.). The deposit amount must bear a reasonable relationship to anticipated damages. For institutional deals with deposits in the 1-5% range, enforceability is rarely challenged successfully.
- **Illinois:** IL courts enforce LD provisions where: (1) the parties intended to agree on LD, (2) the amount is reasonable at the time of contracting, and (3) actual damages would be difficult to determine. Standard institutional PSA deposit amounts satisfy these requirements.
- **Texas:** Texas enforces LD provisions unless the amount is a "penalty" (i.e., grossly disproportionate to actual damages). Texas courts apply a two-part test: (1) the harm caused by the breach is incapable or difficult of estimation, and (2) the amount of LD is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.
- **Oregon:** The Meadows form (Oregon-governed) provides standard LD language. Oregon follows the Restatement (Second) of Contracts Section 356: LD provisions are enforceable if the amount is reasonable in light of anticipated or actual loss and if the difficulty of proof of loss.

## 4. Notice and Cure Periods

### Preferred Position
Buyer's preferred position maximizes cure periods for buyer defaults while minimizing cure periods for seller defaults:

**For Buyer Default:**
- Cure period of 10-15 business days after written notice from seller specifying the nature of the default in reasonable detail
- Closing date automatically extended to accommodate the cure period
- No default shall be deemed to exist until the cure period has expired without cure
- For monetary defaults (failure to fund closing), a shorter cure period of 5 business days is acceptable
- For non-monetary defaults, if the default is capable of cure but cannot reasonably be cured within the initial cure period, buyer shall have such additional time as is reasonably necessary (not to exceed 30 days) provided buyer is diligently pursuing the cure

**For Seller Default:**
- Cure period of no more than 5 business days after written notice from buyer
- Closing date extended only by the number of days in the cure period (no open-ended extensions)
- Seller should not have the right to adjourn the closing to cure a default (distinguish from right to adjourn to cure a title defect, which is a separate provision)

**Cross-reference: UNICO Buyer Side and UNICO Seller Side (Sections 13.1 and 13.2)** -- Both forms provide 5 Business Days cure after notice for both seller and buyer defaults, with the Closing Date extended as necessary to accommodate the cure period. This is symmetrical and generally reasonable, though buyer should push for a longer cure period for buyer defaults.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Specificity of notice.** Require that the default notice specify in reasonable detail the nature of the alleged default and the actions necessary to cure. A vague default notice should not trigger the cure period.
2. **Automatic closing extension.** Ensure the closing date is expressly extended to accommodate the cure period. Without this, a default notice delivered close to the closing date could create an impossible cure timeline.
3. **What constitutes "cure."** Define cure broadly for buyer's defaults: substantial compliance with the defaulted obligation, correction of the condition giving rise to the default, or elimination of the basis for the default claim. For seller's defaults: strict compliance.
4. **Non-monetary default extensions.** For buyer's non-monetary defaults (e.g., failure to deliver a required approval, organizational issue), push for the "diligent pursuit" extension.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller wants no cure period for buyer default (immediate forfeiture).** Fallback chain: (1) 15 business days; (2) 10 business days; (3) 5 business days (UNICO model -- this is the floor).
- **Seller wants a long cure period for its own defaults (15-30 days).** Fallback: accept 10 business days maximum for seller's non-monetary defaults, 5 business days for monetary defaults. Pair with buyer's right to terminate or pursue specific performance if cure is not completed within the cure period.
- **Seller wants the right to extend the closing date indefinitely to cure.** Hard no. Cap the total extension at 30 days. Beyond that, buyer should have the right to terminate.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk:** No cure period for buyer default. A single inadvertent failure (e.g., wire transfer delay) could result in forfeiture of the deposit.
- **Medium risk:** Excessively long seller cure period. Ties up buyer's capital and delays the transaction without certainty of closing.
- **Low risk:** Symmetrical 5-business-day cure periods (UNICO model).

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Data Centers:** Longer cure periods for both sides may be warranted due to the complexity of closing deliverables and transfer requirements (licenses, permits, interconnection agreements).
- **Multifamily (Affordable/LIHTC):** Regulatory approval requirements may necessitate longer cure periods for specific conditions.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** NY courts strictly enforce time-is-of-the-essence provisions and contractual cure periods. A party that fails to cure within the contractual period loses its right to cure. However, where the contract is silent on cure, NY courts may imply a reasonable cure period.
- **All Jurisdictions:** The cure period is a contractual right. Courts generally will not extend a contractual cure period absent fraud, duress, or unconscionability.

## 5. Pre-Closing Breach of Representations -- Buyer's Election Rights

### Preferred Position
If buyer discovers prior to closing that any of seller's representations or warranties are untrue, incomplete, or inaccurate, buyer should have the following election:

1. **If the breach has a Material Adverse Effect:** Buyer may elect to either (a) terminate the PSA and receive a full refund of the deposit plus reimbursement of Purchaser's Costs, or (b) close and receive a purchase price credit equal to the full amount of the damages caused by the breach (not just the amount exceeding any basket/threshold).

2. **If the breach does not have a Material Adverse Effect:** Buyer must close, but (a) the basket amount for post-closing claims is reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of known pre-closing breaches (IL Pro-Buyer model), and (b) buyer's right to make post-closing indemnification claims for known breaches is fully preserved (no "anti-sandbagging" waiver).

**Cross-reference: IL Pro-Buyer (Section 18.02(c)(i))** -- This form provides the most favorable buyer treatment of pre-closing breaches. For non-MAE breaches, buyer must close but the Basket Amount is reduced by the loss amount. For MAE breaches, buyer may terminate (with Claim Notice) or close with a purchase price adjustment.

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 10.4)** -- This form contains a harsh anti-sandbagging provision: if the Closing occurs, buyer "expressly waives, relinquishes and releases any right or remedy" for breaches that were "within Purchaser's Knowledge at the time of the Closing." This should be strongly resisted.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Definition of "Material Adverse Effect."** Push for a defined dollar threshold that is meaningful but not so high as to be unreachable. The IL Pro-Buyer form ties MAE to the Basket Amount (claims must exceed the basket to constitute MAE). Negotiate the basket amount to be appropriately low relative to deal size (e.g., $50K-$100K for a $50M deal, or 0.1-0.25% of Purchase Price).
2. **Anti-sandbagging protection.** This is critical. Buyer must preserve the right to make post-closing claims for rep breaches even if buyer had actual knowledge of the breach at closing. The Detailed Seller Side form's anti-sandbagging waiver is extreme and should be struck or narrowed. At minimum, insist that knowledge-based waivers apply only to matters that buyer actually knew (not "should have known" or constructive knowledge) and only to matters that buyer discovered through its own due diligence (not matters disclosed by seller in a bring-down certificate or update notice).
3. **Bring-down certificate.** Require seller to deliver a bring-down certificate at closing confirming that all representations and warranties remain true and correct in all material respects as of the closing date. Any exceptions noted in the bring-down certificate should give buyer the right to terminate (if MAE) or adjust the purchase price (if non-MAE).
4. **Seller's right to cure a pre-closing breach.** If seller discovers a breach of its own reps before closing, seller should have a limited right to cure (e.g., 10 business days) before buyer can exercise termination rights. But the cure must be actual cure, not merely disclosure.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller insists on full anti-sandbagging waiver (knowledge-based waiver of claims).** Fallback chain: (1) No anti-sandbagging waiver (buyer preserves all claims regardless of knowledge); (2) Waiver only for matters actually known (not constructively known) based on buyer's own independent investigation (not seller disclosures); (3) Waiver only for matters expressly disclosed in the bring-down certificate and accepted by buyer in writing; (4) Accept a limited anti-sandbagging provision but reduce the basket amount to zero for known breaches.
- **Seller insists that buyer's only remedy for pre-closing rep breach is termination (no price adjustment).** Fallback: (1) Price adjustment for all breaches; (2) Price adjustment for non-MAE breaches, termination for MAE breaches; (3) Termination only but with full Purchaser's Costs reimbursement.
- **Seller insists on a high MAE threshold.** Push for the lowest possible threshold. Fallback: tie the MAE threshold to the basket amount for post-closing indemnification claims.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk:** Anti-sandbagging waivers that eliminate buyer's post-closing claims for known breaches. Buyer may face pressure to close despite known issues (from lenders, partners, timing constraints) and needs to preserve claims.
- **High risk:** No right to a purchase price adjustment for pre-closing breaches. Forces buyer into an all-or-nothing choice (close with known defects or terminate and lose the deal).
- **Medium risk:** MAE threshold that is too high. In a $100M deal, a $500K MAE threshold means breaches up to $499K give buyer no remedy.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily:** Rent roll accuracy is critical. Breaches of rent roll reps should always constitute MAE if they affect projected NOI by more than a defined percentage (e.g., 3-5%).
- **Retail:** Tenant default and co-tenancy provisions are key. Breaches relating to anchor tenant defaults or co-tenancy triggers should be treated as MAE regardless of dollar threshold.
- **Industrial:** Environmental reps are paramount. Any breach of environmental reps should arguably constitute MAE.
- **Data Centers:** Compliance with power contracts and interconnection agreements is mission-critical. Breaches should be treated as MAE.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** NY follows the "pro-sandbagging" rule -- a buyer's knowledge of a breach at closing does not preclude post-closing claims absent an express contractual waiver. This makes the anti-sandbagging waiver issue a contractual negotiation point rather than a legal default rule.
- **California:** California follows a similar pro-sandbagging approach under general contract principles, though the case law is less developed.
- **Delaware:** Delaware generally follows the pro-sandbagging rule, which is relevant for entities organized in Delaware.
- **Illinois:** IL courts have not definitively adopted a clear pro- or anti-sandbagging rule, making the contractual provision all the more important.

## 6. Willful/Intentional Breach Carve-Outs from Liquidated Damages

### Preferred Position
While buyer wants the LD cap to apply to its own defaults (see Section 3 above), buyer must carve out seller's willful or intentional breach from any limitations on buyer's remedies. The carve-out should provide that if seller's default is willful or intentional:

- Buyer may pursue both specific performance AND actual damages (not just one or the other)
- The LD cap / Seller Breakage Fee cap does not apply
- Buyer may recover consequential damages, including lost profits and opportunity costs
- Buyer may recover attorneys' fees regardless of the prevailing-party provision

**Cross-reference: UNICO Buyer Side (Section 13.1)** -- Provides that where "the default or breach by Seller was intentional or willful," buyer may "recover any and all damages arising out of such intentional or willful default" in addition to specific performance. This is the strongest precedent.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Definition of "willful" or "intentional" breach.** Avoid leaving this undefined. Proposed definition: "A default by Seller that occurs as a result of Seller's deliberate and voluntary act or omission, with knowledge that such act or omission constitutes or will result in a breach of this Agreement, and is not the result of negligence, mistake, or circumstances beyond Seller's reasonable control." This excludes inadvertent failures but captures deliberate deal-breaking conduct.
2. **Seller's conveyance to a third party.** Expressly provide that seller's conveyance of the property to a third party at any time after the Effective Date (other than in connection with a permitted 1031 exchange) constitutes a willful breach per se.
3. **Interplay with LD provision.** Ensure the willful breach carve-out is expressly stated to override the LD cap. Do not rely on courts to imply this -- courts in many jurisdictions will enforce the LD cap as written even for willful breaches.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller argues willful breach carve-outs undermine the certainty that LD provisions are designed to provide.** Response: LD provisions protect against the difficulty of proving damages from good-faith failures to close. Willful breaches are qualitatively different -- seller should not be able to cap its exposure for deliberate misconduct. Fallback: limit the carve-out to specific scenarios (e.g., seller conveys to a third party, seller files for bankruptcy protection to avoid closing).
- **Seller demands that the willful breach carve-out be reciprocal.** Accept this cautiously. If buyer's willful default triggers uncapped liability (overriding the LD cap on buyer's side), this eliminates the LD protection that is buyer's primary negotiation objective. Fallback: agree to reciprocity but define "willful" buyer default very narrowly (e.g., buyer expressly repudiates the PSA in writing).

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk:** No willful breach carve-out for seller's defaults. Seller can deliberately breach, return the deposit (or pay a capped Breakage Fee), and sell to a higher bidder with no additional consequence.
- **Medium risk:** Reciprocal willful breach carve-out with a broad definition that could capture buyer conduct that was not truly "willful."

### Asset-Type Variations
- Relevant across all asset types. Particularly important in hot markets with rapid appreciation or competitive bidding for scarce assets.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **California:** Cal. Civ. Code Section 3294 permits punitive damages for fraud, oppression, or malice. A willful breach accompanied by fraudulent intent could support punitive damages independently of the PSA's LD provisions.
- **New York:** NY courts may refuse to enforce LD caps where the breach is willful and the LD amount is grossly inadequate, but this is not a reliable rule. Contractual carve-outs are preferable.
- **All Jurisdictions:** The better practice is to address willful breach expressly in the PSA rather than relying on common law exceptions to LD enforceability.

## 7. Seller's Right to Adjourn Closing to Cure

### Preferred Position
Buyer should tightly limit seller's right to adjourn the closing date to cure title defects, condition issues, or default:

- Seller may adjourn the closing once, for a maximum of 30 days, to cure a specific identified defect
- Seller must give buyer written notice of the adjournment specifying the defect and the proposed cure, at least 5 business days before the scheduled closing date
- If seller fails to cure within the adjournment period, buyer may elect to (a) terminate and receive a full deposit refund plus Purchaser's Costs, or (b) close with such title as seller can convey and receive a purchase price credit for the diminution in value caused by the uncured defect, or (c) pursue specific performance
- Seller may not adjourn the closing to cure a willful breach or intentional default

**Cross-reference: Meadows (Section 3.2)** -- Provides for a "Seller Closing Extension Right" -- the specific terms were blank in the form but the structure contemplates a limited extension.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Number of adjournments.** Insist on one adjournment only. Multiple adjournments create indefinite delay.
2. **Maximum duration.** Push for 15 days. Fallback: 30 days. Hard limit: 45 days. Beyond that, buyer should have the right to terminate.
3. **Outside closing date.** Regardless of adjournment rights, include an absolute outside closing date beyond which neither party may extend. Buyer should have the right to terminate if closing has not occurred by the outside date.
4. **Buyer's right to terminate during adjournment.** If buyer identifies additional defaults or changed conditions during the adjournment period, buyer should have the right to terminate immediately without waiting for the adjournment to expire.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller demands open-ended adjournment rights.** Hard no. Insist on a cap. Fallback: two adjournments of 15 days each (30 days total).
- **Seller demands the right to adjourn without specifying the defect.** Reject. Seller must identify the specific defect being cured so buyer can assess whether the cure is feasible and monitor progress.
- **Seller demands that buyer's only remedy after failed cure is termination (no specific performance).** Reject if possible. Buyer needs all remedies available if seller cannot close after taking the adjournment.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk:** Unlimited adjournment rights. Seller can delay closing indefinitely, tying up buyer's capital and organizational resources.
- **Medium risk:** Adjournment with no requirement to identify the specific defect. Seller can use the adjournment period strategically (e.g., to shop the deal to other buyers).
- **Low risk:** Single 30-day adjournment with specific cure requirements and buyer termination right.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily (LIHTC/Affordable):** Regulatory clearances may genuinely require longer timeframes. Consider a 45-60 day adjournment for regulatory cure only, with shorter periods for standard title/condition issues.
- **Office/Industrial:** Standard 30-day adjournment is typically sufficient.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** NY law permits reasonable adjournments of closing in the absence of a time-is-of-the-essence declaration. However, once time is declared of the essence (typically by formal notice), the closing date becomes a firm deadline and adjournment rights must be exercised before the TOE notice.
- **All Jurisdictions:** Contractual adjournment rights will be enforced as written.

## 8. Waiver of Consequential and Punitive Damages

### Preferred Position
Buyer's preferred position is asymmetric:
- **Buyer waives consequential/punitive damages against seller** only in limited circumstances (and with a carve-out for willful breach, as discussed in Section 6)
- **Seller broadly waives consequential, punitive, special, incidental, and exemplary damages against buyer** -- this protects buyer's exposure for its own defaults

Alternatively, if a mutual waiver is required, ensure:
- The waiver applies to both parties symmetrically
- The waiver is carved out for willful/intentional breach
- The waiver does not extend to third-party claims (e.g., if seller's breach causes buyer to breach a contract with a third party, buyer should be able to recover those losses)
- The waiver does not apply to indemnification obligations (which should be governed separately by the indemnification article)

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 10.4)** -- Contains a mutual waiver of "consequential, incidental, indirect, punitive, special or exemplary damages or lost profits." This is the most comprehensive waiver language among the precedents.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Scope of the waiver.** Resist waiving "lost profits" -- for buyer, lost profits from the inability to operate the acquired property is a core component of actual damages for seller default. If forced to include lost profits in the waiver, carve out willful breach.
2. **Carve-out for willful breach.** Non-negotiable. Without this carve-out, the waiver protects a deliberately breaching party.
3. **Carve-out for indemnification.** Ensure the consequential damages waiver does not limit indemnification obligations (which typically cover third-party claims that may include consequential elements).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller insists on a broad mutual waiver with no carve-outs.** Fallback chain: (1) Mutual waiver with willful breach carve-out; (2) Mutual waiver with willful breach and third-party claims carve-outs; (3) Mutual waiver with willful breach carve-out and agreement that the waiver does not apply to specific performance remedies or Purchaser's Costs reimbursement; (4) Accept broad mutual waiver only if paired with robust specific performance and Purchaser's Costs provisions.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk:** Broad waiver of all consequential damages against seller with no willful breach carve-out. Eliminates buyer's most powerful deterrent against deliberate seller breach.
- **Medium risk:** Mutual waiver that inadvertently covers indemnification obligations.
- **Low risk:** Mutual waiver with appropriate carve-outs.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Applicable uniformly across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **All Jurisdictions:** Consequential damages waivers in commercial contracts between sophisticated parties are generally enforceable. Courts may, however, refuse to enforce a waiver where the breach is willful and the waiver would effectively insulate the breaching party from all meaningful liability.

---

## 9. Limitation on Seller's Aggregate Liability (Post-Closing)

### Preferred Position
For post-closing claims (rep/warranty breaches discovered after closing), buyer should push for the highest possible liability cap and the lowest possible basket/deductible:

- **Cap:** 3-5% of Purchase Price (push for 5%, accept 3% as fallback, resist anything below 1.5%)
- **Basket (deductible/threshold):** $50,000-$100,000 for a $50M+ deal (or 0.1-0.2% of Purchase Price). Once the basket is exceeded, seller is liable for the full amount from dollar one (not just the excess) -- this is the "tipping basket" approach.
- **Survival period:** 12-18 months after closing for general reps; 36 months or longer for environmental, tax, and ERISA reps; no survival limit for fraud or intentional misrepresentation
- **Holdback mechanism:** For deals where seller is an SPE that may be dissolved post-closing, require a portion of the purchase price (equal to the liability cap) to be held in escrow as a holdback fund to secure seller's post-closing obligations. The IL Pro-Buyer form (Section 18.02(c)) provides a detailed holdback mechanism.

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 10.4)** -- Cap of 1% of Purchase Price (the "Claim Cap"), 6-month survival period, $100,000 basket (tipping basket structure). This is extremely seller-favorable.

**Cross-reference: IL Pro-Buyer (Section 18.02(c)(ix))** -- Provides for a defined Basket Amount and Cap, with detailed holdback escrow mechanics.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Cap amount.** The Detailed Seller Side form's 1% cap is aggressively low. For a $100M deal, that is only $1M -- potentially inadequate for significant rep breaches (e.g., undisclosed environmental contamination, rent roll misrepresentations). Push for 3-5%. Minimum acceptable: 1.5%.
2. **Basket structure.** Insist on a "tipping basket" (once the basket is exceeded, seller is liable from dollar one) rather than a "deductible basket" (seller is only liable for amounts exceeding the basket). The Detailed Seller Side form uses a tipping basket ("in which event the full amount of such valid claims against Seller, and not just the amount above One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) shall be actionable").
3. **Survival period.** 6 months (Detailed Seller Side form) is far too short. Many rep breaches are not discoverable within 6 months. Push for 12-18 months as the minimum. For specific categories (environmental, ERISA, tax), push for 36 months or the applicable statute of limitations.
4. **Holdback.** For any deal where seller is an SPE, the holdback is essential. Without it, seller can dissolve and distribute proceeds, leaving buyer with an uncollectible judgment. The IL Pro-Buyer form provides a detailed holdback mechanism including: (a) deposit of holdback amount with an escrow agent at closing, (b) claims process with notice and objection procedures, (c) automatic release of unclaimed holdback funds to seller at the holdback termination date.
5. **Mitigation requirements.** The Detailed Seller Side form requires buyer to "first seek recovery under any insurance policies, Leases and Contracts prior to seeking recovery from Seller." This is overly burdensome. Accept a requirement that buyer not make duplicative claims (i.e., buyer cannot recover the same loss from both seller and a third party), but reject a requirement that buyer exhaust other remedies before pursuing seller.
6. **Non-recourse to seller affiliates.** Both the Detailed Seller Side form (Section 11.16) and the IL Pro-Buyer form (Section 18.03) include strong exculpation provisions limiting buyer's recourse to seller's assets (or, post-closing, to the net proceeds of sale). Accept this as market standard, but ensure the holdback is outside the scope of the exculpation (i.e., the holdback funds are available to satisfy claims even if seller has no other assets).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller demands a 1% cap.** Fallback chain: (1) 5% cap; (2) 3% cap; (3) 2% cap; (4) 1.5% cap with holdback for the full cap amount; (5) 1% cap only if paired with 18-month survival and holdback for 100% of the cap.
- **Seller demands a high basket ($250K+ for a $50M deal).** Fallback chain: (1) $50K basket (tipping); (2) $100K basket (tipping); (3) $150K basket (tipping); (4) $200K basket (deductible). Do not exceed 0.5% of Purchase Price.
- **Seller demands a 6-month survival period.** Fallback chain: (1) 18 months; (2) 12 months; (3) 9 months (hard floor for general reps). Separate track: carve out environmental, ERISA, and tax reps for longer survival (statute of limitations).
- **Seller refuses holdback.** Alternatives: (a) guaranty from seller's parent entity or managing member for the cap amount, (b) letter of credit, (c) escrow funded from a portion of the purchase price, (d) rep/warranty insurance (increasingly common in institutional CRE). See NY Checklist recommendation that seller post security (escrow, LOC, or parent guaranty).

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk:** No post-closing liability cap mechanism paired with a dissolving SPE seller. Buyer has no practical recourse.
- **High risk:** Cap below 1% of Purchase Price or survival period under 9 months.
- **Medium risk:** Deductible basket structure (vs. tipping basket). Dollar amounts can be significant on large deals.
- **Low risk:** Reasonable mitigation requirements.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily:** Higher cap (3-5%) warranted due to the large number of units, tenants, and potential for rent roll inaccuracies. Longer survival for tenant-related reps.
- **Industrial:** Higher cap for environmental reps specifically. Consider a separate environmental indemnity with its own cap and survival period.
- **Retail:** Tenant-related reps (particularly regarding anchor tenants, co-tenancy clauses, and exclusive use restrictions) warrant longer survival.
- **Data Centers:** Compliance reps (power, connectivity, environmental) warrant higher caps and longer survival due to the catastrophic consequences of inaccuracies.
- **Office:** Standard ranges apply.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York (NY Checklist):** Recommends that buyer negotiate for the "largest possible security amount, which could be between 1% to 10% of the purchase price" and that seller entity "cannot be dissolved or wound-up" for an agreed period after closing. This is strong buyer-side guidance.
- **Illinois:** The IL Pro-Buyer form's holdback mechanism is the most detailed among the precedents and provides a useful template for any jurisdiction.
- **All Jurisdictions:** Liability caps and survival periods are contractual provisions that courts will enforce as written between sophisticated commercial parties.

## 10. Dispute Resolution -- Litigation vs. Arbitration vs. Mediation

### Preferred Position
For institutional CRE transactions, buyer generally prefers litigation over arbitration:

- **Litigation** in a court of competent jurisdiction in the jurisdiction where the property is located
- Jury trial waiver (mutual)
- No mandatory mediation or arbitration
- Prevailing party entitled to recover attorneys' fees and costs

Rationale: Litigation preserves the right to seek emergency injunctive relief (critical for specific performance), provides appellate review, and creates published precedent. Arbitration awards are difficult to appeal and arbitrators may "split the baby."

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 11.5)** -- Provides for jury trial waiver and consent to exclusive jurisdiction in specified courts (Colorado state court or U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado). This is a reasonable model.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Venue/jurisdiction.** Push for venue in the jurisdiction where the property is located. If the property is in a jurisdiction with efficient courts and strong commercial real estate jurisprudence (e.g., New York, Delaware, Illinois), this is advantageous. Resist seller's attempts to set venue in seller's home jurisdiction if different from the property location.
2. **Jury trial waiver.** Accept this -- both parties benefit from having commercial real estate disputes decided by a judge rather than a jury. All sophisticated institutional forms include this.
3. **Exclusive vs. non-exclusive jurisdiction.** Push for exclusive jurisdiction -- this prevents seller from filing in a different forum to gain a strategic advantage.
4. **Emergency relief.** If arbitration is required (uncommon but possible), insist on a carve-out allowing either party to seek emergency injunctive relief (including temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions) from a court of competent jurisdiction pending the arbitration.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller insists on arbitration.** If forced to accept arbitration, insist on: (a) arbitration before a panel of three arbitrators (not a single arbitrator), (b) at least one arbitrator with real estate experience, (c) AAA or JAMS rules, (d) arbitration in the jurisdiction where the property is located, (e) carve-out for emergency injunctive relief in court, (f) reasoned written award requirement.
- **Seller insists on mandatory mediation before litigation.** Acceptable as a precondition to litigation provided: (a) the mediation is non-binding, (b) the mediation must be completed within 30 days, (c) the requirement does not apply to emergency relief or specific performance claims, (d) a party's participation in mediation does not waive any rights or remedies.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk:** Mandatory arbitration without court carve-out for emergency relief. Could prevent buyer from obtaining a TRO to prevent seller from conveying the property to a third party.
- **Low risk:** Mandatory mediation as precondition (with appropriate carve-outs and time limits).

### Asset-Type Variations
- Generally applicable across all asset types. For multi-property portfolio deals, consider whether a single venue is appropriate or whether disputes relating to specific properties should be heard in the jurisdiction where that property is located.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** NY courts are highly experienced in commercial real estate disputes. The NY Commercial Division provides an efficient forum for complex disputes.
- **Illinois:** Cook County Circuit Court, Chancery Division, handles commercial real estate disputes effectively.
- **California:** California courts are competent but can be slow. Consider specifying a department or division with commercial expertise.
- **Texas:** Texas courts enforce arbitration agreements robustly under both the FAA and TAA. If accepting arbitration in Texas, ensure the agreement clearly specifies the applicable rules.

---

## 11. Attorney Fee Shifting -- Prevailing Party Provisions

### Preferred Position
Include a prevailing party attorney fee provision that applies broadly to all disputes arising out of or relating to the PSA:

- The prevailing party in any legal action, proceeding, or arbitration arising out of or related to the PSA shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, court costs, and all other litigation expenses from the non-prevailing party
- The provision should apply at all stages: investigation, pretrial, trial, and appeal
- The court (not the parties) determines the "prevailing party" based on which party's major arguments or position prevailed
- The provision survives closing and termination

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 11.8)** -- "The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, whether at the investigative, pretrial, trial or appellate level. The prevailing party shall be determined by the court based upon an assessment of which party's major arguments or position prevailed."

**Cross-reference: Meadows (Section 9.2)** -- Standard prevailing party provision: "the unsuccessful party to such action or proceeding shall pay to the prevailing party all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses."

**Cross-reference: Seller Income Property Form (Section 15)** -- Prevailing party provision covering "court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses...including travel and expert witness fees."

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Scope.** Ensure the provision covers all disputes "arising out of or related to" the PSA, not just actions "under" the PSA. This captures tort claims, fraud claims, and other extra-contractual theories.
2. **"Prevailing party" definition.** Some forms leave this undefined, which can create satellite litigation about who "prevailed." The Detailed Seller Side form's standard (court determines based on "which party's major arguments or position prevailed") is workable.
3. **Survival.** The provision must expressly survive both closing and termination. Without survival, the provision dies when the PSA terminates (which is when it is most needed).
4. **Caps.** Resist caps on recoverable attorneys' fees. If seller insists, negotiate a reasonable cap (e.g., $500K or 1% of Purchase Price).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller resists any fee-shifting provision.** The "American Rule" (each party bears its own fees) applies by default in most U.S. jurisdictions. Without a contractual provision, buyer cannot recover its fees even if it prevails. Push firmly for inclusion. Fallback: include the provision but limit it to disputes where the prevailing party obtains a judgment or order (not just a favorable settlement).
- **Seller wants fee-shifting only for buyer defaults.** Reject. Fee-shifting must be mutual to be enforceable in many jurisdictions. A one-sided fee provision may be struck as unconscionable.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk:** No fee-shifting provision. Buyer may incur significant litigation costs enforcing its rights with no ability to recover them.
- **Low risk:** Mutual fee-shifting with reasonable scope and survival.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Applicable uniformly across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **California:** Cal. Civ. Code Section 1717 mandates that contractual attorney fee provisions in bilateral contracts be interpreted as mutual, even if drafted as one-sided. This protects buyer even if seller's form includes a one-sided fee provision.
- **New York:** NY courts enforce prevailing party fee provisions as written. There is no statutory override for one-sided provisions, so insist on mutual language.
- **Texas:** Texas enforces contractual fee-shifting provisions. Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code also provides a statutory basis for fee recovery in breach of contract actions.

---

## 12. Time-Is-of-the-Essence Provisions

### Preferred Position
Buyer's preferred approach depends on timing dynamics:

- **Before closing:** Resist seller's attempts to declare time is of the essence for buyer's performance. If time is of the essence, any failure to close on the exact date (even by one day) constitutes a material breach. Buyer prefers flexibility.
- **If TOE is included:** Ensure it is mutual (applies equally to seller's obligations), and that it is subject to express adjournment and extension rights.
- **Protective language:** Even if TOE is declared, include a proviso that the TOE designation does not limit any party's express contractual rights to extend or adjourn under the PSA.

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 11.14)** -- Contains the most aggressive TOE provision: "Time is of the essence of this Agreement and all covenants and deadlines hereunder" with a further statement that the TOE agreement "shall not be waived or modified by any conduct of the parties." This is extremely seller-favorable.

**Cross-reference: Meadows (Section 9.10)** -- Standard TOE provision: "Subject to the express Closing extension rights included herein, time is of the essence."

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Mutual application.** If TOE is included, it must apply to seller's obligations equally. The Meadows form is acceptable -- it preserves express extension rights while declaring TOE.
2. **Preservation of extension rights.** Critical. The Detailed Seller Side form's language could be read to override even express extension provisions (by saying TOE "may only be modified or waived by the express written agreement of Purchaser and Seller"). Insist on the Meadows approach: "Subject to the express Closing extension rights included herein."
3. **No unilateral TOE declaration.** In New York practice, a party can make time of the essence by sending a formal TOE notice (even if the PSA does not contain a TOE provision) after the closing date has passed. Negotiate that neither party may unilaterally declare TOE without at least 30 days' written notice.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller insists on blanket TOE with no preservation of extension rights.** Reject. This creates a trap -- any extension provision elsewhere in the PSA is arguably overridden by the TOE clause. Fallback: accept TOE but include an express statement that TOE is "subject to the extension and adjournment rights set forth in Sections [X], [Y], and [Z]."
- **Seller insists on TOE for buyer only (not seller).** Reject as asymmetric and potentially unconscionable.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk:** TOE provision that overrides express extension rights. Creates an inadvertent default trap.
- **Medium risk:** Blanket mutual TOE without preservation of extension rights.
- **Low risk:** Mutual TOE subject to express extension rights (Meadows model).

### Asset-Type Variations
- Applicable uniformly. TOE is more common in hot markets where seller wants certainty of closing date.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** TOE has particular legal significance in NY. A party that fails to close on a TOE date is in material breach and loses the right to close thereafter. NY courts require at least 30 days' notice before a party can unilaterally declare TOE by notice (absent a PSA provision). If the PSA contains a TOE provision, no separate notice is required.
- **California / Oregon / Illinois / Texas:** TOE provisions are enforced as written. The legal consequences are similar to NY -- failure to perform by the TOE date is a material breach.

---

## 13. Definition of Default and Anticipatory Repudiation

### Preferred Position
The PSA should contain a clear definition of "default" and address anticipatory repudiation:

**Definition of Default:**
- A party's failure to perform any material obligation under the PSA within the applicable cure period after written notice
- A party's breach of any representation or warranty that is not cured within the applicable cure period after written notice
- A party's voluntary bankruptcy filing, or the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary bankruptcy case
- A party's assignment for the benefit of creditors
- A party's express written repudiation of the PSA or affirmative statement that it will not perform its obligations

**Anticipatory Repudiation:**
- If either party expressly repudiates the PSA (orally or in writing) or takes action demonstrating a clear intent not to perform (e.g., seller lists the property for sale, buyer's investor publicly announces withdrawal from the transaction), the non-repudiating party should have the right to treat the repudiation as an immediate default without waiting for the closing date or providing a cure period

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Materiality qualifier.** For non-monetary defaults, include a materiality qualifier ("material failure to perform"). Minor, immaterial failures should not trigger default remedies.
2. **Bankruptcy as automatic default.** This is standard and should not be controversial.
3. **Anticipatory repudiation.** This is less commonly addressed in PSA forms but is important. If seller announces it will not close, buyer should not have to wait until the closing date to pursue remedies.
4. **Distinction between conditions and defaults.** Failure of a condition precedent is not the same as a default. If a condition fails through no party's fault, the remedy should be termination and deposit return (not default remedies).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller resists including anticipatory repudiation.** Fallback: rely on common law anticipatory repudiation doctrine (available in most jurisdictions), but note that contractual provisions provide greater certainty and avoid litigation over whether a repudiation occurred.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk:** Unclear distinction between default and failure of condition. Can lead to disputes about whether a party is entitled to LD or merely deposit return.
- **Low risk:** Well-drafted default definition with materiality qualifier and cure period.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Applicable uniformly across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **UCC/Restatement:** The doctrine of anticipatory repudiation is recognized under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts Sections 250-253 and is available in all U.S. jurisdictions. However, the specific application varies, and contractual provisions are advisable for certainty.

---

## 14. Interaction Between Default Remedies and Indemnification Obligations

### Preferred Position
The PSA should clearly delineate the relationship between the default/remedies article and the indemnification provisions:

- Pre-closing defaults are governed exclusively by the default article (LD for buyer default, specific performance/termination for seller default)
- Post-closing claims for rep/warranty breaches are governed by the indemnification article (with its own cap, basket, survival, and claims procedures)
- The LD provision (seller's sole remedy for buyer default) should not limit buyer's surviving indemnification obligations (e.g., indemnity for property damage during inspections, broker commission indemnities)
- Conversely, the indemnification cap should not limit buyer's default remedies against seller (specific performance, Seller Breakage Fee)

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 10.4)** -- Provides that post-closing, "the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and Purchaser under, arising out of or relating to this Agreement...shall be as set forth in this Section 10.4." This merges the default and indemnification concepts, which is acceptable if the Section 10.4 provisions are favorable.

**Cross-reference: IL Pro-Buyer (Section 18.02(c))** -- Detailed holdback mechanism governs post-closing claims with its own procedures, effectively serving as both the default remedy and indemnification mechanism for post-closing matters.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Surviving obligations carve-out from LD.** The LD provision (seller's sole remedy for buyer default) should expressly carve out buyer's surviving indemnification obligations. This is standard in all precedent forms. But ensure the carve-out is narrowly drawn and does not expand the categories of surviving obligations to circumvent the LD cap.
2. **Post-closing exclusivity.** If the PSA provides that the indemnification article is the "sole and exclusive remedy" for post-closing claims, ensure this does not limit buyer's right to pursue fraud claims or claims for willful misrepresentation. Common law fraud should not be subject to the contractual indemnification cap.
3. **Claims procedures.** The indemnification article should include detailed claims procedures (notice requirements, objection rights, escrow release mechanics) that are separate from and do not conflict with the default article's notice and cure provisions.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller demands that all post-closing claims (including fraud) be subject to the indemnification cap.** Reject for fraud and intentional misrepresentation. Fallback: accept a higher cap for fraud claims (e.g., the full Purchase Price).

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk:** Ambiguity in the relationship between default and indemnification provisions. Creates uncertainty about which remedies are available for which types of claims.
- **Medium risk:** Indemnification cap that also caps fraud claims. Eliminates deterrent against deliberate misrepresentation.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Applicable uniformly across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **All Jurisdictions:** Courts generally hold that contractual limitations on remedies do not preclude claims for fraud or intentional misrepresentation, as a matter of public policy. However, the case law varies, and an express carve-out is strongly advisable.

---

## 15. Exculpation and Non-Recourse Provisions

### Preferred Position
Accept seller's exculpation of individual members, partners, shareholders, officers, directors, and agents as market standard, subject to the following protections:

- The holdback escrow (see Section 9) is carved out from the non-recourse limitation (holdback funds remain available to satisfy claims regardless of seller entity dissolution)
- If seller is an SPE, require that seller's operating agreement or organizational documents prohibit dissolution or wind-up for an agreed period (12-18 months) after closing, or that seller maintain a minimum net worth or insurance coverage during the survival period
- The exculpation does not extend to claims for fraud or intentional misrepresentation by the exculpated individuals personally

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 11.16)** -- Limits buyer's recourse to "Seller's interest in the Property (or, following the Closing, to the net proceeds of the sale of the Property actually received by Seller)." This is market standard but can be a trap if seller distributes proceeds immediately after closing.

**Cross-reference: IL Pro-Buyer (Section 18.03)** -- Broad exculpation of all seller affiliates. Buyer "agrees to look solely to Seller and its assets for the satisfaction of any liability or obligation."

**Cross-reference: Meadows (Section 9.12)** -- Standard exculpation provision.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Net proceeds retention.** The Detailed Seller Side form limits post-closing recourse to "net proceeds of the sale of the Property actually received by Seller." This is workable only if paired with a holdback. Without a holdback, seller can distribute all proceeds immediately and buyer has no recourse.
2. **Anti-dissolution covenant.** Require seller to covenant that it will not dissolve or wind up for at least 12 months after closing (or until the expiration of the survival period, whichever is longer). The NY Checklist recommends this approach.
3. **Fraud carve-out.** Exculpation should not protect individuals who personally committed fraud or intentional misrepresentation. This is a matter of public policy in most jurisdictions.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Seller refuses anti-dissolution covenant.** Fallback: require a holdback, guaranty, or LOC as alternative credit support.
- **Seller refuses fraud carve-out from exculpation.** Push firmly -- this is a matter of public policy and courts in most jurisdictions would likely refuse to enforce an exculpation that shields personal fraud. Including the carve-out merely makes the contract consistent with applicable law.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk:** No holdback and no anti-dissolution covenant. Buyer may have no practical recourse for post-closing claims.
- **High risk:** Exculpation that covers fraud by individual actors.
- **Low risk:** Standard exculpation with holdback and anti-dissolution covenant.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Particularly critical for institutional deals where seller is a fund vehicle or special purpose entity that will be dissolved after closing.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York (NY Checklist):** Expressly recommends that buyer negotiate (a) that seller entity cannot be dissolved for an agreed period, and (b) that seller post security (escrow, LOC, or guaranty) for post-closing obligations.
- **Delaware:** As the domicile of many SPE sellers, Delaware's LLC Act permits members to dissolve an LLC at any time unless the operating agreement provides otherwise. Contractual anti-dissolution covenants are enforceable.
- **All Jurisdictions:** Exculpation provisions are generally enforceable between sophisticated commercial parties, but courts may refuse to enforce them to the extent they shield personal fraud.
