# Conditions Precedent to Closing — Buyer Playbook

This playbook addresses the Conditions Precedent to Closing provisions of a commercial real estate purchase and sale agreement from the **buyer/purchaser** perspective. It is designed for use by AI agents conducting contract review on behalf of institutional buyers acquiring income-producing commercial real estate ($50M+ deals). The conditions precedent section is among the most critical provisions in any PSA because it defines the circumstances under which the buyer is legally obligated to close -- and, equally important, the circumstances under which the buyer may walk away with its deposit.

## Seller Representations and Warranties True at Closing (Bring-Down Condition)

### Preferred Position

Buyer should require that all of Seller's representations and warranties be true, correct, and complete in all material respects as of the Closing Date, as though made at and as of the Closing Date. This is the "bring-down" condition, and it is the single most important buyer closing condition. The bring-down should apply without exception to every Seller representation, and Seller should be required to deliver a closing certificate (sometimes called a "Bring Down Certificate" or "Seller's Closing Certificate") reaffirming the representations at Closing.

**Preferred language:**

> As a condition precedent to Purchaser's obligation to close, each representation and warranty made by Seller in this Agreement shall be true, accurate, and complete in all material respects as of the Closing Date as though made at and as of the Closing Date, and Seller shall have delivered to Purchaser a certificate, duly executed by an authorized officer of Seller, certifying to the foregoing.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 10.1.1) provides that "there shall be no material breach of any representations and warranties made by Seller" and that "such representations and warranties shall have remained true and correct in all material respects." The Pro-Buyer IL form (Section 14.02) similarly requires that "Seller's representations and warranties in Section 13.01 shall be true and correct [in all material respects] both as of the date made and as of the Closing Date." The Meadows form (Section 7.2) requires delivery of a Seller's Closing Certificate certifying all representations are true and correct in all material respects "as if made on and as of the Closing Date."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Insist on a "dual date" bring-down: representations must be true both as of the Effective Date and as of the Closing Date. Some seller-side forms limit the bring-down to representations that are true "as of the Effective Date" only, which guts the protection.
- Require delivery of a duly executed Bring Down Certificate at Closing. This transforms breached representations into a document delivery failure, triggering a separate closing condition.
- Resist any formulation that allows the Seller to "update" or "supplement" its representations at Closing to reflect changed conditions and thereby eliminate the buyer's termination right. The ASB/Hardware Block form (Section 6.1(a)(ii)) permits exceptions for changes that "cannot reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect," which is acceptable if the MAE threshold is properly defined.
- Beware of anti-sandbagging provisions. The ASB/Hardware Block form (Section 7.4) provides that "all of Seller's representations and warranties shall automatically be deemed modified to reflect Purchaser's Knowledge as of the end of the Study Period." This effectively eliminates buyer remedies for representation breaches that buyer could have discovered during diligence but chose not to raise.
- Resist provisions that deem representations "modified" by information contained in tenant estoppel certificates or due diligence materials delivered to buyer.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller should not be held to a strict bring-down for matters that change in the ordinary course of business between signing and closing. Seller may also argue that buyer had an opportunity to discover issues during due diligence and should not be able to "sandbag" Seller.

**Fallback chain (in priority order):**

1. Accept a "Material Adverse Effect" qualifier on the bring-down, but only if the MAE definition is robust and buyer-favorable (see separate section below on MAE definition).
2. Accept a carve-out for changes "caused by the acts or omissions of Purchaser or its agents" (as in the ASB/Hardware Block form, Section 6.1(a)(ii)(A)(x)).
3. Accept a carve-out for changes resulting from "the ownership, operation, management and/or leasing of the Property in the normal course of business in compliance with [the pre-closing covenants]" (as in the ASB/Hardware Block form, Section 6.1(a)(ii)(A)(z)), but only if the pre-closing covenants are themselves robust.
4. Accept a limited anti-sandbagging provision that deems representations modified only by information "expressly" contained in due diligence materials, not by information that buyer "should have discovered."
5. Last resort: Accept a provision that, if a representation becomes untrue between signing and closing, Seller must notify buyer and buyer has the right to terminate with deposit return if the change is materially adverse, but buyer has no damages claim for breach.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — Failure to secure a proper bring-down condition exposes the buyer to closing on a property where fundamental assumptions have changed. Without this condition, buyer has no clean exit if, for example, Seller becomes insolvent, a major tenant defaults, or undisclosed litigation emerges between signing and closing. The bring-down certificate also serves as an evidentiary anchor for post-closing breach claims within the survival period.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Pay particular attention to representations regarding tenant defaults, pending lease expirations, and free rent or TI obligations. Office markets are volatile and major tenants may give notice of non-renewal between signing and closing.
- **Industrial:** Focus on environmental representations. Changes in environmental condition between signing and closing (new contamination discoveries, regulatory orders) are among the most value-destructive.
- **Retail:** Ensure bring-down covers co-tenancy clause triggers, percentage rent reporting, and exclusive use violations. The departure of an anchor tenant between signing and closing can cascade through co-tenancy provisions.
- **Multifamily:** Rent roll accuracy is paramount. Ensure the bring-down covers occupancy levels, rent concessions, and delinquency rates.
- **Data Center:** Bring-down should cover power capacity representations, interconnection agreements, and SLA compliance. Loss of a critical utility feed between signing and closing can destroy the investment thesis.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Bring-down certificates in New York practice are customary and typically require notarization. The NY Checklist (Practical Law) expressly provides that buyer should require Seller to "confirm that all the seller's representations and warranties are true as of the closing date (except as disclosed in a bring down certificate, if permitted)."
- **California:** Under Cal. Civ. Code Section 1102 et seq., residential disclosure requirements can bleed into mixed-use transactions. For commercial deals, contractual bring-down provisions are the primary mechanism.
- **Illinois:** The Pro-Buyer IL form provides robust bring-down conditions but also permits Seller to "bring down" its representations by disclosing changed conditions, subject to Purchaser's right to terminate.
- **Delaware (entity level):** Many SPE sellers are Delaware LLCs. Verify that the authorized signatory of the Bring Down Certificate has actual authority under the LLC agreement.

## Seller Compliance with Covenants

### Preferred Position

Buyer should require that Seller shall have performed and complied in all material respects with all of the terms, covenants, and conditions of the Agreement to be performed or complied with by Seller prior to or at Closing. This condition should be independent of (not subsumed within) the bring-down condition.

**Preferred language:**

> As a condition precedent to Purchaser's obligation to close, Seller shall have performed and complied in all material respects with all of the terms of this Agreement to be performed and complied with by Seller prior to or at the Closing.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 10.1.1) combines the covenant compliance condition with the bring-down condition. The ASB/Hardware Block form (Section 6.1(a)(i)) states this condition separately: "Seller shall have performed and complied in all material respects with all of the terms of this Agreement." The Seller-Side Income Property form (Section 5.4(a)) similarly conditions buyer's obligation on Seller's delivery of closing items and truth of representations.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Insist on a standalone covenant compliance condition, separate from the bring-down condition. If combined, a breach of covenant may not trigger the condition unless it also constitutes a breach of representation.
- The "all material respects" qualifier is standard and acceptable. Resist efforts to heighten the standard to "in all respects" (which creates trivial termination rights) or to lower it to "substantial compliance."
- Key covenants to monitor: maintenance of insurance, operation of property in the ordinary course, restrictions on new leases and lease modifications, restrictions on new contracts, no material alterations, cooperation with buyer's financing, and notification of material events.
- Ensure the covenant compliance condition covers both affirmative covenants (things Seller must do) and negative covenants (things Seller must not do).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The "material respects" qualifier should be sufficient protection, and buyer should not have the right to terminate over trivial covenant breaches.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept the "all material respects" qualifier but ensure buyer retains the right to terminate (with deposit return) if the breach is not cured within a specified notice-and-cure period (typically 5 business days, as in the UNICO Buyer Side form, Section 10.1).
2. Accept a provision that the covenant compliance condition is not failed if Seller cures the breach before Closing.
3. Accept a carve-out for covenants that become impossible to perform due to force majeure, but only if the covenant in question is not a payment or delivery obligation.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — A Seller that violates its pre-closing covenants (e.g., entering into unfavorable lease amendments without buyer consent, letting insurance lapse, making material alterations) can materially change the economic profile of the property before buyer takes title. The covenant compliance condition is the buyer's primary enforcement tool.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office/Retail:** Leasing activity covenants are paramount. Seller must not enter into new leases, lease amendments, or lease terminations without buyer consent after the due diligence period.
- **Industrial:** Focus on maintenance covenants for specialized equipment (dock levelers, fire suppression, environmental controls).
- **Multifamily:** Covenant compliance regarding turnover of units, application of security deposits, and maintenance of common areas is critical.
- **Data Center:** Covenants regarding maintenance of power and cooling infrastructure, SLA compliance, and interconnection agreements are uniquely important.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** The covenant compliance condition is universally accepted in institutional practice. No material jurisdictional variation.

## No Material Adverse Change (MAC/MAE)

### Preferred Position

Buyer should insist on a standalone closing condition that there has been no material adverse change in the physical, economic, or operational condition of the Property from the condition as of the Effective Date, reasonable wear and tear excepted. This condition should be defined broadly to capture any diminution in value, loss of income, or physical deterioration that would materially affect the buyer's investment thesis.

**Preferred language:**

> As a condition precedent to Purchaser's obligation to close, there shall be no material adverse change in the physical, economic, or operational condition of the Improvements and the Personal Property from the condition as of the Effective Date, reasonable wear and tear excepted. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Rent Roll as of the Closing Date shall not have materially changed from the Rent Roll attached hereto as Schedule [NUMBER]. The term "materially changed" as used in the preceding sentence shall mean a diminution in the aggregate base rent reflected on the Rent Roll of more than [X] percent ([X]%).

**Cross-reference:** The Pro-Buyer IL form (Section 14.02) includes both a general MAC condition and a specific rent roll test, defining "materially changed" as a diminution in aggregate base rent exceeding a specified percentage. The NY Checklist recommends buyer negotiate for a condition that "there shall be no material adverse change in the physical, economic, or operational condition of the real property."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Define "Material Adverse Effect" or "Material Adverse Change" with specificity. Vague definitions invite litigation. The ASB/Hardware Block form uses the term "Material Adverse Effect" but leaves its definition to the definitions article -- ensure you review and negotiate that definition.
- Include both objective and subjective triggers: (a) an objective rent roll test (e.g., diminution of more than 5% in aggregate base rent), (b) loss or bankruptcy of any tenant leasing more than X% of the rentable area, (c) physical damage exceeding a dollar threshold, (d) new environmental contamination, (e) loss of material permits or approvals.
- The MAC condition should be independent of the casualty/condemnation provisions. A casualty that does not rise to the level of "Major Loss" under the casualty section may nonetheless constitute a MAC.
- Resist carve-outs for "general market conditions" or "changes in law." While common in M&A deals, these carve-outs are inappropriate for single-asset real estate transactions where the specific property's condition is the entire investment.
- Negotiate for a MAC condition that gives buyer the sole right to determine whether a MAC has occurred, subject to a reasonableness standard.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The MAC condition is duplicative of the bring-down condition, the casualty/condemnation provisions, and the estoppel requirements. Seller may also argue that market-driven changes in property value or occupancy should not trigger a termination right.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a MAC condition with a defined dollar threshold or percentage test, rather than a subjective standard.
2. Accept a MAC condition that requires buyer to demonstrate the change would have a MAC "from and after the Closing" (forward-looking), rather than a change from the Effective Date.
3. Accept a MAC condition limited to physical condition and tenant occupancy, excluding general economic conditions.
4. Accept the elimination of a standalone MAC condition if the bring-down condition is robust and the Seller representations include detailed representations regarding occupancy, rent roll accuracy, and physical condition. This is a significant concession.
5. Last resort: Accept a provision under which, if a MAC occurs, buyer may terminate with deposit return but has no damages claim. This is standard in most precedent forms.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Without a MAC condition, buyer bears the risk that the property's value deteriorates between signing and closing due to tenant departures, market crashes, physical damage below casualty thresholds, or regulatory changes. In a rising-rate or recessionary environment, the MAC condition is a critical buyer protection.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Define MAC triggers to include loss of any tenant leasing more than 15-20% of NRA, or aggregate occupancy falling below a stated threshold (e.g., 80%).
- **Industrial:** Include environmental contamination discoveries and loss of material permits as MAC triggers.
- **Retail:** Include co-tenancy clause triggers and anchor tenant departures as specific MAC events. A "dark" anchor can cascade through co-tenancy provisions and destroy underwritten NOI.
- **Multifamily:** Include occupancy decline below a stated threshold and average effective rent decline below a stated amount.
- **Data Center:** Include loss of power feed, cooling system failure, and termination of critical interconnection agreements as MAC triggers.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** The NY Checklist expressly recommends negotiating for a MAC condition. New York courts have interpreted MAC clauses narrowly in M&A contexts (e.g., IBP, Inc. v. Tyson Foods), and the same framework may apply to real estate PSAs.
- **California:** No specific statutory framework, but California courts generally enforce contractual MAC definitions as written.
- **All jurisdictions:** The MAC condition is a negotiated term with no statutory mandate. Its scope and enforceability depend entirely on the contractual language.

## Title Policy Issuance

### Preferred Position

Buyer should require, as an express condition precedent to closing, that the Title Company shall be irrevocably committed to issue (or shall have issued) an extended coverage owner's title insurance policy (ALTA 2006 form or successor), insuring buyer's fee simple title to the Property in the amount of the Purchase Price, subject only to the Permitted Exceptions, together with all endorsements required by buyer and buyer's lender.

**Preferred language:**

> As a condition precedent to Purchaser's obligation to close, the Title Company shall be irrevocably committed and ready, willing, and able to issue the Title Policy insuring Purchaser's good, marketable, and indefeasible title to the Property subject only to the Permitted Exceptions.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 10.1.2) provides that "The Title Company shall be irrevocably committed and ready, willing and able to issue the Title Policy." The Pro-Buyer IL form (Section 14.02) requires the Title Company to have "issued the Title Insurance Policy insuring Purchaser's good, marketable, and indefeasible title to the Property subject only to the Permitted Exceptions." The Seller-Side Income Property form (Section 4.5) conditions closing upon the Title Company's willingness to issue "an extended coverage owner's policy of title insurance (2006 ALTA form)."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Insist on "irrevocably committed" language -- not merely "willing" to issue. This prevents the Title Company from later conditioning issuance on additional requirements.
- The title policy must be an extended coverage ALTA owner's policy, not a standard coverage policy. Extended coverage eliminates the standard exceptions for matters that would be disclosed by an accurate survey, rights of parties in possession, and mechanic's liens.
- All endorsements required by buyer and buyer's lender should be specified in an exhibit or schedule and included in the condition. Common endorsements include: comprehensive (ALTA 9), access (ALTA 17), survey (ALTA 25), contiguity (ALTA 19), zoning (ALTA 3.1), tax parcel (ALTA 18), and environmental protection lien (ALTA 8.1/8.2).
- The policy amount should be not less than the Purchase Price. For leveraged acquisitions, buyer's lender will require a separate loan policy in the amount of the loan, which is buyer's responsibility.
- "Permitted Exceptions" must be a defined term, cross-referenced to the title review process. The condition should not permit the Title Company to add new exceptions between commitment and policy issuance.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller has no control over the Title Company and should not bear the risk that the Title Company refuses to issue. Seller may also resist paying for endorsements beyond the standard owner's policy.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a condition that the Title Company is "willing" (rather than "irrevocably committed") to issue the policy, provided buyer has the right to terminate if the Title Company imposes conditions that would constitute non-Permitted Exceptions.
2. Accept allocation of endorsement costs to buyer (which is market in most jurisdictions for extended coverage and endorsement premiums).
3. Accept a provision allowing Seller to substitute a different Title Company if the designated Title Company refuses to issue, provided the substitute is an ALTA member with comparable financial ratings.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — Title insurance is the foundation of buyer's ownership interest. Closing without an adequate title policy exposes buyer to risk of loss from undisclosed liens, encumbrances, adverse claims, and defects in title. This condition should never be waived.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The title policy condition is universal. Endorsement requirements vary by asset type and lender.
- **Data Center:** Ensure the title policy covers any separately owned utility infrastructure, fiber pathways, and cross-connect agreements that run with the land.
- **Retail (ground lease pads):** If the property includes ground-leased outparcels, ensure the title condition covers leasehold title policies for those parcels.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Title insurance is mandatory in virtually all institutional transactions. The NY Checklist requires buyer to negotiate that "the title company is willing to issue the title insurance subject only to the agreed permitted exceptions and with all endorsements required by the purchaser."
- **Texas:** Texas has regulated title insurance rates. Endorsement availability and pricing is controlled by the Texas Department of Insurance, Title Division. Certain endorsements available in other states may not be available in Texas.
- **Iowa:** Iowa does not have a private title insurance system. Title guaranty certificates are issued through the Iowa Finance Authority. Structure the condition accordingly.
- **Survey states vs. abstract states:** In "survey states" (most Western states), the ALTA survey is the primary basis for the extended coverage policy. In "abstract states" (portions of the Midwest), an abstract of title may also be required.

## Tenant Estoppel Certificate Delivery

### Preferred Position

Buyer should require, as a condition precedent to closing, that Seller deliver executed estoppel certificates from tenants representing a specified percentage of the leased square footage, including estoppels from all "Major Tenants" (defined by a square footage or rent threshold). Estoppels should be in the form attached to the PSA, dated within 30 days of closing, and should confirm the accuracy of the lease terms, rental amounts, commencement and expiration dates, and the absence of landlord defaults.

**Preferred language:**

> As a condition precedent to Purchaser's obligation to close, Purchaser shall have received Conforming Tenant Estoppels from all of the Major Tenants plus a sufficient number of other Tenants under Leases so that Purchaser has received Conforming Tenant Estoppels for Leases covering at least [80]% of the currently leased square footage of the Improvements by the Estoppel Deadline.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 10.1.3) requires "Conforming Tenant Estoppels from all of the Major Tenants plus a sufficient number of other Tenants under Leases so that Buyer has received Conforming Tenant Estoppels for Leases covering at least 80% of the currently leased square footage." The ASB/Hardware Block form (Section 6.1(a)(iv)) requires estoppels from "(1) each Major Tenant; and (2) a sufficient number of Non-Major Tenants so that, in the aggregate, Purchaser receives estoppel certificates that cover at least seventy percent (70%)" of leased square footage. The Pro-Buyer IL form (Section 21.01) requires an "Acceptable Estoppel from each and every Tenant." The Meadows form (Section 7.2) requires estoppels from specifically named major tenants.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Percentage threshold:** Buyer should target 80-90% of leased NRA. The ASB/Hardware Block form uses 70% -- this is more seller-favorable and should be resisted in most transactions. For heavily tenanted properties (e.g., multi-tenant retail), 75-80% may be a pragmatic target.
- **Major Tenant requirement:** All Major Tenants (defined as tenants leasing more than a specified threshold, typically 10,000 SF or 10% of NRA, whichever is greater) must deliver estoppels without exception. No Seller estoppel certificate should substitute for a Major Tenant estoppel.
- **Form of estoppel:** The estoppel form should be attached as an exhibit to the PSA. It should confirm: lease term, rental amount, security deposit, landlord obligations (TI, free rent), absence of defaults, absence of offsets or claims, absence of options or rights of first refusal not disclosed in the lease, and confirmation that the lease constitutes the entire agreement.
- **Dating requirement:** Estoppels should be dated not more than 30 days prior to the Closing Date. Stale estoppels are meaningless.
- **Lender addressee:** Estoppels should be addressed to buyer, its lender (if applicable), and their respective successors and assigns.
- **Lease-form estoppels:** Some leases (particularly with credit tenants) prescribe their own form of estoppel. Accept lease-form estoppels if they substantially cover the required items, but resist tenants who submit estoppels with material qualifications, reservations of rights, or disclosed defaults.
- **Seller's estoppel certificates:** The ASB/Hardware Block form permits Seller to substitute its own estoppel certificate for up to one-half of Major Tenants and for Non-Major Tenants as needed to satisfy the threshold. This is a significant seller concession that buyer should resist or limit. Seller estoppel certificates provide weaker protection because they are subject to Seller's knowledge limitation and survive only for the representation survival period.
- **Deemed satisfaction:** The ASB/Hardware Block form deems estoppels delivered before the end of the Study Period to "conclusively" count toward the requirement. This prevents buyer from later objecting to estoppels it accepted during diligence.
- **Objection period:** Buyer should have 2-5 business days after receipt of each post-diligence estoppel to object. The ASB/Hardware Block form provides 2 business days with deemed approval for non-response.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller cannot control tenant behavior and should not bear the risk that tenants refuse to deliver estoppels. Seller may also argue that the estoppel condition should be limited to a "commercially reasonable efforts" obligation.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a commercially reasonable efforts obligation for Seller to obtain estoppels, but retain the right to terminate (with deposit return) if the estoppel threshold is not met. This is the structure in most precedent forms.
2. Accept Seller estoppel certificates as a substitute for Non-Major Tenants only, never for Major Tenants.
3. Accept a slightly lower percentage threshold (e.g., 75% instead of 80%) if all Major Tenants must deliver.
4. Accept a provision that the estoppel condition failure does not constitute a Seller default (merely a failed condition giving buyer termination rights), as in the ASB/Hardware Block form: "Purchaser agrees that in no event shall the failure of Seller to obtain sufficient estoppel certificates to satisfy the Estoppel Requirement in and of itself constitute a default by Seller."
5. Accept lease-form estoppels (rather than buyer's preferred form) for credit tenants or tenants whose leases prescribe a specific estoppel form.
6. Last resort: Accept a provision that extends the Closing Date by a stated period (e.g., 30 days) to allow additional time to obtain estoppels.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — Tenant estoppels are the buyer's primary mechanism for confirming the accuracy of the rent roll, the status of landlord obligations, and the absence of tenant claims. Without estoppels, buyer relies entirely on Seller's representations, which are limited by knowledge qualifiers and survival periods. For financed acquisitions, the lender will independently require estoppels as a condition of loan funding.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Major tenant estoppels are essential. For multi-tenant office, focus the threshold on tenants representing the largest rent contributions, not just square footage.
- **Industrial:** Estoppel requirements are straightforward for single-tenant NNN assets. For multi-tenant industrial parks, apply the same percentage-based framework as office.
- **Retail:** Anchor tenant estoppels are critical because anchor leases typically contain co-tenancy clauses, exclusive use provisions, and operational covenants that affect the entire center. Require estoppels from all anchors regardless of percentage threshold.
- **Multifamily:** Tenant estoppels are typically not required for multifamily transactions because of the large number of short-term residential leases. Instead, buyer relies on rent roll certifications and representations. If the multifamily property includes ground-floor commercial tenants, estoppels from those tenants should be required.
- **Data Center:** Estoppels from data center tenants should confirm critical additional items: power allocation, cooling requirements, SLA terms, and interconnection rights.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** The NY Checklist specifies that buyer should identify "major tenants from which the seller must obtain an estoppel" and "that may deliver their own form of estoppel." Estoppel dating should be within 30 days of closing per NY practice.
- **California:** No statutory estoppel obligation exists for commercial tenants. The estoppel right must be contractual (in the lease or the PSA).
- **Illinois:** The Pro-Buyer IL form requires an "Acceptable Estoppel from each and every Tenant" -- the most aggressive buyer position. This is achievable in some transactions but is frequently negotiated down to a percentage threshold.

## SNDA Delivery

### Preferred Position

If buyer is financing the acquisition, buyer should require Seller to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver subordination, non-disturbance, and attornment agreements (SNDAs) from all tenants whose leases require or permit SNDAs, and from all tenants identified by buyer's lender as requiring SNDAs. The SNDA delivery should be a condition precedent to closing.

**Preferred language:**

> Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Purchaser subordination, non-disturbance, and attornment agreements from each Tenant identified by Purchaser or Purchaser's lender, in the form reasonably required by Purchaser's lender, executed by the applicable Tenant.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 9.3) requires Seller to cooperate with buyer's financing efforts, including "requesting financial information, estoppel certificates and/or SNDAs from the Tenants, enforcing such requirements for estoppel certificates and SNDAs to the extent the same may be required under the Leases." The Seller-Side Income Property form (Section 7.3(d)) similarly requires cooperation but expressly disclaims any obligation to obtain SNDAs as a condition to closing. The Pro-Buyer IL form includes SNDAs as defined terms (Section 12.01(f)).

### Key Negotiation Points

- SNDAs are primarily a lender requirement. Buyer's obligation is to ensure the PSA places an appropriate effort obligation on Seller.
- Distinguish between leases that are "superior" to the new mortgage (existing before the mortgage is recorded) and leases that are "subordinate." Superior leases need non-disturbance protection for the tenant; subordinate leases may need the SNDA for the lender's benefit.
- The level of effort required should match the lease terms. If the lease requires the tenant to deliver an SNDA upon landlord's request, Seller should be obligated to make that request. If the lease is silent on SNDAs, Seller's obligation should be "commercially reasonable efforts."
- Do not make the SNDA condition absolute -- make it a condition only for tenants identified as "required SNDA tenants." Buyer's lender may waive the SNDA requirement for certain tenants.
- The SNDA form should be negotiated and attached as an exhibit to the PSA, or the PSA should reference the lender's standard form.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller has no obligation to obtain SNDAs because buyer chose to finance the acquisition. Seller may also argue that obtaining financing is not a condition to buyer's obligation to close (which is typically true in institutional deals).

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a "commercially reasonable efforts" standard (not an absolute obligation).
2. Accept that failure to obtain SNDAs is not a Seller default and does not give buyer a termination right, unless the failure is due to Seller's refusal to cooperate.
3. Accept that buyer's lender must approve the list of required SNDA tenants within a specified period after signing.
4. Accept that Seller need only request (not obtain) SNDAs, and that buyer's lender must waive or modify its SNDA requirement if tenants refuse.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — SNDAs are important for financed acquisitions but are typically a lender requirement rather than a buyer condition. The primary risk of failing to obtain SNDAs is that the lender may refuse to fund, which puts buyer in default of the PSA. Buyer should coordinate SNDA requirements with its lender early in the process to avoid last-minute complications.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office/Retail:** SNDAs are most critical for anchor tenants and credit tenants whose leases are superior to the new mortgage.
- **Industrial:** Single-tenant NNN deals typically require one SNDA, which is usually addressed in the lease itself.
- **Multifamily:** SNDAs are not applicable to residential tenants. Ground-floor commercial tenants may require SNDAs.
- **Data Center:** Lenders may require SNDAs from all data center tenants due to the specialized nature of the improvements and the difficulty of re-tenanting.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** SNDA requirements are contract-driven and lender-driven. No material jurisdictional variation in the condition precedent framework, though the substantive SNDA terms vary by jurisdiction (e.g., notice and cure period rights for the lender).

## No Material Tenant Defaults

### Preferred Position

Buyer should require, as a condition precedent to closing, that there be no uncured monetary default or material nonmonetary default on the part of any tenant under any lease, and no condition or circumstance which, but for the passage of time or the giving of notice (or both), would constitute such a default.

**Preferred language:**

> As a condition precedent to Purchaser's obligation to close, there shall be no uncured monetary default or [material] nonmonetary default on the part of any Tenant under any Lease, nor any condition or circumstance which, but for the notice and opportunity to cure, would constitute such a default.

**Cross-reference:** The Pro-Buyer IL form (Section 14.02) includes this condition verbatim. The NY Checklist recommends that buyer negotiate for a condition that "no tenant of the property is in default under its lease, and no circumstances exist that may lead to a default."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Define the scope of "material" for nonmonetary defaults. A tenant that is open and operating but has installed non-conforming signage is technically in default, but it should not block closing.
- The condition should cover "incipient" defaults -- circumstances that would constitute a default after notice and the expiration of a cure period. This prevents Seller from avoiding the condition by simply not sending default notices.
- Consider a dollar threshold for monetary defaults (e.g., $25,000 individually or $100,000 in aggregate) to avoid trivial termination triggers.
- Exclude defaults that existed (and were disclosed) as of the end of the due diligence period, as buyer presumably underwrote the deal with knowledge of those defaults.
- This condition overlaps with the bring-down condition (if Seller represents that no tenant defaults exist) and the estoppel condition (if estoppels confirm no defaults). Even with those overlapping protections, the standalone condition is valuable because it sets a clear, objective standard.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller cannot control tenant behavior and should not bear the risk that a tenant defaults between signing and closing. Seller may also argue that the condition should be limited to "material" defaults of "major tenants."

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a "materiality" qualifier for nonmonetary defaults.
2. Accept a dollar threshold for monetary defaults.
3. Limit the condition to Major Tenants only (not all tenants).
4. Accept a provision that Seller may cure the default before Closing, with a closing extension if necessary.
5. Eliminate the standalone condition and rely on the bring-down condition and estoppel requirements, but only if those provisions are robust.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Tenant defaults can destroy the income stream that buyer is acquiring. A major tenant in monetary default may be heading toward bankruptcy. This condition gives buyer the right to walk away if tenant quality deteriorates between signing and closing.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Focus on monetary defaults by major tenants. A major office tenant in financial distress can result in months of lost revenue and expensive re-tenanting.
- **Industrial:** Single-tenant defaults are deal-breakers. For multi-tenant industrial, apply a materiality threshold.
- **Retail:** Tenant defaults in retail often cascade through co-tenancy provisions. An anchor tenant default may trigger rent abatement rights for inline tenants.
- **Multifamily:** Not typically applicable -- residential tenant defaults are managed through normal property operations, not PSA conditions.
- **Data Center:** A data center tenant in default may be at risk of equipment removal, which can damage shared infrastructure.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** This is a negotiated term with no statutory framework. Courts will enforce the condition as written.
- **New York:** The NY Checklist specifically recommends this condition.

## No Material Casualty or Condemnation

### Preferred Position

Buyer should require, as a condition precedent to closing, that there has been no material casualty or condemnation affecting the Property between the Effective Date and Closing, or if such an event has occurred, buyer retains the right to terminate with deposit return. This condition is typically addressed in a separate article of the PSA (Casualty and Condemnation) but should be cross-referenced in the conditions precedent article.

**Preferred language:**

> As a condition precedent to Purchaser's obligation to close, no Material Casualty (as defined herein) shall have occurred, and no condemnation or eminent domain proceedings materially affecting the Property shall be pending or threatened, unless Purchaser has elected to proceed under Article [X] of this Agreement.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 12.2) provides buyer the right to terminate if damage exceeds $500,000, is not covered by insurance, or impairs access. The UNICO Seller Side form uses a $1,000,000 threshold. The ASB/Hardware Block form uses the defined term "Material Casualty." The Meadows form (Section 6.3) ties the threshold to "cost to restore" as determined by Seller, which is seller-favorable. The Pro-Buyer IL form (Section 17.01) gives buyer the right to terminate if a "material portion" of the property is condemned, damaged, or destroyed.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Define "Material Casualty" and "Material Taking" with specificity. Use a dollar threshold appropriate to the deal size (e.g., 2-5% of the Purchase Price, or an absolute dollar amount).
- Buyer should have the sole right to elect whether to proceed or terminate following a material casualty/condemnation. Seller should not have the right to force buyer to close.
- If buyer elects to proceed, buyer should receive: (a) all insurance proceeds collected by Seller, (b) an assignment of Seller's right to uncollected proceeds, (c) a credit for the deductible amount, and (d) a credit for any uninsured loss.
- Seller should not be obligated (or permitted, without buyer's consent) to repair or restore prior to Closing.
- For condemnation, buyer should have the right to participate in all condemnation proceedings.
- The election period (typically 10 business days) should be measured from Seller's notice to buyer, not from the event itself.
- If buyer does not elect to terminate within the election period, buyer should be deemed to have elected to proceed. This "deemed election to proceed" is standard but should be resisted in favor of a "deemed election to terminate" if possible.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Buyer should be required to close for minor casualties, with a credit for insurance proceeds. Seller may argue for a higher dollar threshold to limit buyer's termination right.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a dollar threshold for "Material Casualty" at 2-5% of Purchase Price.
2. Accept a "deemed election to proceed" if buyer fails to elect within the specified period.
3. Accept that Seller has the right to extend Closing to determine the scope of loss and insurance coverage before buyer must elect.
4. Accept that the casualty credit is limited to insurance proceeds actually received or assigned, plus the deductible -- not the full cost of restoration.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Casualty and condemnation events can fundamentally alter the character and value of the Property. This condition ensures buyer is not forced to close on a damaged or diminished asset.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Fire or water damage to a major tenant's space can trigger lease termination rights and business interruption claims. The dollar threshold should reflect the cost of tenant relocation and build-out.
- **Industrial:** Environmental contamination from a casualty (e.g., chemical spill) may not be covered by standard property insurance. Ensure the condition covers environmental casualties.
- **Retail:** Casualty to an anchor space can trigger co-tenancy rent reductions across the entire center. The economic impact may far exceed the physical repair cost.
- **Multifamily:** Even minor casualties can displace residents and create habitability issues. Consider a lower threshold for multifamily.
- **Data Center:** Data center casualties are uniquely destructive because of the value of tenant equipment and the cost of downtime. The threshold should reflect the specialized nature of the improvements.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** New York follows the doctrine of equitable conversion, meaning risk of loss passes to buyer upon execution of the PSA absent a contrary contractual provision. The Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act (N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law Section 5-1311) modifies this for material destruction. Always include an express contractual casualty/condemnation provision.
- **UVPRA states:** States that have adopted the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act (including New York, California, Illinois, and others) provide that risk of loss remains with Seller until legal title passes. The PSA casualty provisions should be consistent with (and typically supersede) the statutory framework.
- **Oregon:** The Meadows form (Oregon property) does not reference the UVPRA but includes contractual casualty provisions.

## Delivery of All Seller Closing Documents

### Preferred Position

Buyer should require, as an independent condition precedent to closing, that Seller shall have delivered (or deposited into escrow) all documents required to be delivered by Seller at Closing. This condition should cross-reference a comprehensive list of Seller's closing deliverables, which should be specified in a separate section of the PSA.

**Preferred language:**

> As a condition precedent to Purchaser's obligation to close, Seller shall have delivered to escrow (or directly to Purchaser, as applicable) each of the documents and items specified in Section [X] of this Agreement.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 10.1.4) conditions buyer's obligation on "Seller's delivery to escrow of the documents and items specified in Section 11.4." The Seller-Side Income Property form (Section 5.4(a)) similarly conditions buyer's obligation on Seller's delivery of closing items.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The closing document delivery list should be comprehensive and include, at minimum:
  - Special warranty deed (or bargain and sale deed with covenants, per local custom)
  - Assignment and assumption of leases
  - Assignment and assumption of contracts and intangibles
  - Bill of sale for personal property
  - FIRPTA certificate (non-foreign affidavit)
  - Owner's title affidavit (gap indemnity)
  - Tenant notice letters (signed by Seller)
  - Bring Down Certificate / Seller's Closing Certificate
  - Transfer tax declarations/affidavits
  - Entity authorization documents (resolutions, incumbency certificates)
  - Keys, access cards, and building systems codes (outside escrow)
  - Originals of all leases, contracts, and permits (outside escrow)
  - Any loan assumption documents (if applicable)
- Each closing document should be in a form attached as an exhibit to the PSA, or in a form "reasonably satisfactory" to buyer and the Title Company.
- Seller should bear the risk of failure to deliver. If Seller cannot deliver a required document, buyer should have the right to terminate with deposit return.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller should not be required to deliver documents in forms dictated by buyer's lender, and certain "customary" documents should be sufficient without pre-negotiated forms.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept that closing documents will be in "customary" form if the PSA does not attach exhibits, but require buyer's reasonable approval of the final forms.
2. Accept that "originals" will be delivered to the extent in Seller's possession, with copies for documents not in Seller's possession.
3. Accept that entity authorization documents need only satisfy the Title Company's requirements.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Failure to receive required closing documents can leave buyer without proper chain of title, without enforceable lease assignments, or without contractual protections. The document delivery condition ensures that closing is not a formality but a substantive exchange.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The core closing document list is consistent across asset types. Asset-specific additions include:
  - **Office/Retail:** Tenant estoppels, SNDAs, exclusive use certificates, co-tenancy compliance certificates.
  - **Industrial:** Environmental indemnities (if negotiated), specialized equipment warranties.
  - **Multifamily:** Rent roll certification, security deposit reconciliation, Section 8 contract assignments.
  - **Data Center:** Interconnection agreement assignments, utility contract assignments, generator fuel supply agreement assignments.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Bargain and sale deed with covenants against grantor's acts is the customary deed form. Transfer tax forms (TP-584 and RP-5217) are required. NYC transactions also require RPT returns.
- **Illinois:** The Pro-Buyer IL form requires a "Plat Act Affidavit" in certain transactions.
- **Washington:** The UNICO forms (Washington property) require a Real Estate Excise Tax Affidavit.
- **Oregon:** The Meadows form (Oregon property) requires an Oregon statutory special warranty deed.
- **California:** Preliminary Change of Ownership Report (PCOR) and Documentary Transfer Tax affidavit are required.

## No Injunction or Legal Impediment

### Preferred Position

Buyer should require, as a condition precedent to closing, that there be no injunction, restraining order, or other legal impediment prohibiting or materially restraining the consummation of the transaction. This condition should cover judicial, administrative, and regulatory proceedings.

**Preferred language:**

> As a condition precedent to Purchaser's obligation to close, there shall be no actions, suits, arbitrations, claims, attachments, proceedings, assignments for the benefit of creditors, insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, or other proceedings pending or threatened against Seller that would affect Seller's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and there shall be no order, judgment, injunction, or decree of any court or governmental authority restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

**Cross-reference:** The Pro-Buyer IL form (Section 14.02) includes two distinct litigation/injunction conditions: (a) no suits or proceedings affecting Seller's ability to perform, and (b) no judicial or administrative proceedings "pending against Seller or the Property, which was not disclosed to or discovered by Purchaser before the end of the Due Diligence Period and which will be binding against the Property or Purchaser from and after the Closing." The NY Checklist recommends that buyer negotiate for a condition that "no judicial or administrative proceeding is pending against the seller or the property that may bind the property or the purchaser after the closing."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The condition should cover both pending and "threatened" proceedings. A threatened condemnation or enforcement action can be just as destructive as a pending one.
- Include proceedings "against the Property" as well as proceedings "against Seller." A lien foreclosure action against the Property is a direct threat to buyer's title, even if it does not name Seller as a party.
- Carve out proceedings disclosed to buyer before the end of due diligence, which buyer presumably underwrote.
- Include insolvency proceedings (voluntary and involuntary) against Seller. A Seller in bankruptcy may be unable to convey clear title.
- The condition should not be limited to proceedings that "would" prevent closing -- it should extend to proceedings that "may" affect buyer's ownership or use of the Property after closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** This condition is overbroad and could be triggered by frivolous or baseless claims. Seller may argue for a materiality qualifier.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a materiality qualifier: proceedings must "materially and adversely affect" Seller's ability to close or buyer's ownership of the Property.
2. Accept a carve-out for proceedings that were pending as of the Effective Date and disclosed in the PSA.
3. Accept a condition that the proceeding must be "binding" on the Property or buyer after closing (as in the Pro-Buyer IL form).

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — The no-injunction condition is a standard protective provision. It is rarely the basis for a termination, but it provides critical protection in the unlikely event that a regulatory action, creditor proceeding, or title dispute emerges between signing and closing.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** No material variation. The condition applies equally across asset classes.
- **Data Center:** Add a specific reference to regulatory proceedings affecting power supply, utility permits, or telecommunications licenses.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** The no-injunction condition is universally accepted and enforced. No material jurisdictional variation.
- **New York:** The NY Checklist specifically recommends this condition.

## Tenant Occupancy Requirements

### Preferred Position

Buyer should require, as a condition precedent to closing, that specified major tenants be in occupancy, open for business (if retail), and paying rent without offset or abatement. For non-retail properties, the condition should require that major tenants have not vacated, abandoned, or gone dark.

**Preferred language:**

> As a condition precedent to Purchaser's obligation to close, each Major Tenant shall be in physical occupancy of its premises, shall not have vacated or abandoned its premises, shall not have filed or had filed against it a petition in bankruptcy, and shall be paying rent in accordance with its Lease without offset, abatement, or deduction.

**Cross-reference:** This is not a standard condition in most precedent forms but is recommended by the NY Checklist, which advises buyer to negotiate for a condition that "no tenant of the property is in default under its lease, and no circumstances exist that may lead to a default." The Pro-Buyer IL form addresses this indirectly through the MAC condition and the rent roll stability test.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Limit the condition to Major Tenants to avoid giving buyer a termination right over a minor tenant vacancy.
- Define "occupancy" to mean physical occupancy, not merely the existence of an executed lease. A tenant that has executed a lease but not yet taken possession may not be "in occupancy."
- For retail properties, require that anchor tenants be "open for business" and not merely occupying space. A dark anchor triggers co-tenancy consequences.
- Include a bankruptcy/insolvency trigger for the occupancy condition. A tenant in Chapter 11 may be occupying space but may reject the lease.
- This condition overlaps with the MAC condition and the no-tenant-default condition. Even with those overlaps, a standalone occupancy condition provides additional clarity.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller cannot control tenant occupancy decisions and should not bear the risk. Buyer's recourse is against the tenant under the lease, not against Seller.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Limit the condition to specifically named Major Tenants (rather than a percentage-based test).
2. Accept a carve-out for tenants that vacated before the Effective Date (i.e., buyer underwrote the vacancy).
3. Accept that the condition is satisfied if the tenant is paying rent, even if not in physical occupancy (relevant for credit tenants subleasing space).
4. Eliminate the standalone condition and rely on the MAC condition and rent roll stability test.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE to HIGH** — Depends heavily on tenant concentration. For single-tenant or heavily concentrated properties, this condition is critical. For well-diversified properties, the MAC condition and no-default condition provide adequate protection.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Apply to tenants leasing more than 15-20% of NRA. Office tenants may go remote or sublease space without formal abandonment.
- **Industrial:** Single-tenant industrial requires this condition absolutely. Multi-tenant industrial can use a threshold approach.
- **Retail:** This is most critical for retail. Anchor tenant occupancy directly affects inline tenant co-tenancy rights, percentage rent calculations, and overall center viability.
- **Multifamily:** Not typically applicable at the individual unit level. May be applicable if the multifamily property has a major commercial tenant on the ground floor.
- **Data Center:** Tenant occupancy is tied to deployed equipment and power consumption. A tenant that has removed its equipment has effectively vacated.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** This is a negotiated term with no statutory framework. Courts will enforce the condition as written.

## Seller's Conditions Precedent (Buyer's Obligations)

### Preferred Position

Buyer should review and understand the conditions precedent to Seller's obligation to close, as these conditions effectively define buyer's closing obligations. The buyer's goal is to ensure Seller's conditions are narrow and limited to items within buyer's control, so that buyer is not exposed to termination risk from Seller for reasons outside buyer's control.

**Standard Seller conditions (acceptable):**

1. Buyer shall have delivered the Purchase Price (balance of cash to close) into escrow.
2. Buyer shall have delivered all documents required to be delivered by buyer at Closing (counterpart assignments, transfer tax forms, entity authorization documents).
3. Buyer's representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date.
4. Buyer shall have performed all covenants required to be performed by buyer at or prior to Closing.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 10.2) includes these four conditions. The ASB/Hardware Block form (Section 6.2) includes three conditions: covenant compliance, truth of representations, and receipt of Purchase Price. The Meadows form (Section 7.1) includes covenant performance and truth of representations with a Buyer's Closing Certificate. The Seller-Side Income Property form (Section 5.5) includes deposit of Closing Payment, delivery of closing documents, and truth of representations.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Resist Seller's attempt to add conditions beyond the four standard items listed above. Seller should not have the right to refuse to close based on buyer's failure to obtain financing (which is not a condition in institutional deals), buyer's failure to obtain regulatory approvals, or buyer's failure to satisfy conditions that are within Seller's control.
- If the transaction involves an existing loan assumption, the assumption approval may be a mutual condition (i.e., a condition for both Seller and buyer). See the UNICO forms, which include optional text for "Existing Loan Assumption Approval" as a condition for both parties.
- Ensure Seller's conditions are for the "exclusive benefit" of Seller, so that only Seller can waive them. Buyer should not be permitted to waive Seller's conditions (and vice versa).
- The Meadows form (Section 7.1) provides that if Seller's conditions are not satisfied, the Deposit "shall be paid to Seller" -- this is extremely seller-favorable and effectively converts any buyer breach into a liquidated damages forfeiture. Buyer should resist this structure and ensure that the consequence of failed Seller conditions is governed by the default/remedies article, not an automatic forfeiture.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller needs the right to terminate if buyer cannot close, and Seller's conditions should mirror buyer's conditions for symmetry.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept the four standard conditions but insist that the consequences of failure are governed by the default/remedies article (not automatic forfeiture).
2. Accept a mutual loan assumption condition if applicable.
3. Resist any additional Seller conditions beyond the standard four.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Buyer's primary risk is that Seller's conditions are drafted so broadly that Seller can manufacture a termination right or claim buyer default based on technical non-compliance. Review Seller's conditions carefully to ensure they are limited to items truly within buyer's control.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Seller's conditions are substantially the same across asset classes. No material variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** No material jurisdictional variation for Seller's conditions.

---

## Waiver Mechanics

### Preferred Position

Buyer should insist that the conditions precedent to buyer's obligation to close are for the "exclusive benefit" of buyer, and that only buyer may waive them. Similarly, the conditions precedent to Seller's obligation to close should be for the exclusive benefit of Seller, and only Seller may waive them. Neither party should be able to force the other to waive a condition.

**Preferred language:**

> The conditions set forth in Sections [Buyer's Conditions] are for the exclusive benefit of Purchaser, and the conditions set forth in Section [Seller's Conditions] are for the exclusive benefit of Seller. If any condition has not been satisfied or waived within the period provided, this Agreement may be terminated by the party for whose benefit such condition exists, by written notice to the other party.

**Cross-reference:** The Seller-Side Income Property form (Section 5.6) provides: "The conditions set forth in Sections 5.1 through 5.4 are for the exclusive benefit of Buyer and the conditions set forth in Section 5.5 are for the exclusive benefit of Seller." The ASB/Hardware Block form (Section 6.1) provides that "Each condition may be waived in whole or in part only by written notice of such waiver from Purchaser to Seller." The Meadows form (Section 7.2) provides that "Buyer may waive any or all of such conditions in whole or in part but any such waiver shall be effective only if made in writing."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Waivers must be in writing. Oral waivers should be expressly excluded. All precedent forms require written waivers.
- A waiver of one condition should not constitute a waiver of any other condition. Include a "no waiver by conduct" provision.
- A waiver should not constitute a waiver of any rights or remedies arising from breach. The Meadows form (Section 7.2) provides: "No such waiver shall constitute a waiver by Buyer of any of its rights or remedies if Seller defaults in the performance of any covenant or agreement." This is important -- buyer should be able to waive a condition (e.g., proceed to close despite a minor representation breach) while preserving the right to bring a post-closing claim for damages.
- Beware of "deemed waiver" provisions. The Meadows form (Section 7.1) provides that "After the Closing, any such condition that has not been satisfied shall be treated as having been waived in writing." This deemed waiver provision means that closing itself constitutes a waiver of all unsatisfied conditions. This is standard and generally acceptable, but buyer must understand the implication: if buyer closes knowing a condition is unsatisfied, buyer loses the right to terminate but may retain the right to bring a post-closing claim (depending on the survival provisions).
- Resist mutual conditions that either party can waive. If a condition is truly mutual (e.g., loan assumption approval), specify that either party may terminate if the condition fails, and that neither party can force the other to proceed.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Certain conditions should be mutual (e.g., no injunction, regulatory approvals), and both parties should have waiver rights.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept mutual conditions for regulatory approvals and loan assumption, but not for substantive conditions like bring-down, estoppels, or MAC.
2. Accept "deemed waiver" at closing, but preserve post-closing claims for breach of representations and warranties.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Waiver mechanics are procedural, but they determine whether buyer can exercise its termination rights at Closing. Poorly drafted waiver provisions can trap buyer into closing on a property it would otherwise reject.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** No material variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Courts universally enforce contractual waiver provisions. The parol evidence rule generally prevents claims that an oral waiver was given.

---

## Failure of Condition Consequences (Termination Right and Deposit Return)

### Preferred Position

If a buyer's condition precedent is not satisfied (and is not waived by buyer), buyer should have the right to terminate the Agreement and receive a full return of the Earnest Money Deposit, together with reimbursement of buyer's out-of-pocket due diligence costs. The failure of a buyer condition should not, in itself, constitute a default by either party (unless the failure was caused by a party's breach).

**Preferred language:**

> If any condition precedent to Purchaser's obligation to close set forth in Section [X] has not been timely satisfied (and has not been waived by Purchaser), then Purchaser, in Purchaser's sole and absolute discretion, may either: (i) terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller and Escrow Agent, and Escrow Agent shall refund to Purchaser the Earnest Money Deposit [together with Purchaser's out-of-pocket costs], and upon such refund being made, this Agreement shall terminate and neither party shall have any further rights or obligations except for obligations that expressly survive termination; or (ii) waive any unsatisfied condition and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 10.1) provides buyer the right to "(a) terminate this Agreement and receive the Earnest Money Deposit, and/or (b) if the condition is not satisfied as a result of a default or breach by Seller, pursue Buyer's rights and remedies under Section 13.1." The Pro-Buyer IL form (Section 14.03) provides for termination with deposit return. The Seller-Side Income Property form (Section 5.6) provides: "If any of the conditions set forth in this Section 5 have not been satisfied or waived within the period provided, this Agreement may be terminated by the party benefiting from such condition by written notice to the other party."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The deposit return must be unconditional upon valid termination for failure of a buyer condition. No holdbacks, offsets, or conditions.
- Distinguish between (a) failure of condition due to Seller's breach (which should give buyer both termination rights AND damages/specific performance rights) and (b) failure of condition not due to Seller's breach (which should give buyer termination with deposit return only). The UNICO Buyer Side form makes this distinction effectively.
- Resist provisions that require buyer to give Seller a cure period before terminating for failed conditions. A cure period is appropriate for Seller defaults but not for failed conditions (e.g., buyer should not be required to give Seller additional time to obtain estoppels if the estoppel deadline has passed). However, the UNICO Buyer Side form includes a 5-business-day cure period even for failed conditions, which is market.
- Negotiate for reimbursement of buyer's out-of-pocket costs upon termination for failed conditions. The Pro-Buyer IL form includes "Purchaser's Costs" in the termination refund. This is aggressive and may be resisted by Seller, but it is appropriate when the condition failure is attributable to Seller.
- The Pro-Buyer IL form includes a critical clarification: "The failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Section 14.02 that is not reasonably susceptible of being satisfied within the time allotted under Section 6.02 shall not constitute a default, breach of a covenant, or other failure to perform by Seller hereunder unless the non-satisfaction of such condition is a result of a breach or default by Seller." This protects Seller from being deemed in default merely because a condition fails, while preserving buyer's remedies if the failure is Seller's fault.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Buyer should not receive a "free out" by manufacturing a condition failure. Seller may argue for a cure period, a dispute resolution mechanism, or a requirement that buyer demonstrate the condition failure in good faith.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a cure period (5 business days is market) before buyer may terminate, provided the Closing Date is extended as necessary.
2. Accept that condition failure not caused by Seller's breach gives buyer termination with deposit return but no damages.
3. Accept that buyer bears its own costs upon termination (no reimbursement of due diligence costs).
4. Accept that the escrow agent holds the deposit during any dispute period and does not release until the dispute is resolved (interpleader provision).

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — The consequences of condition failure determine whether buyer can actually exit the transaction if conditions are not met. If the deposit return is conditional, disputed, or subject to Seller's consent, the condition precedent is illusory.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** No material variation in the consequence framework. The dollar amounts at stake vary by asset class and deal size.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **California:** Under California law, liquidated damages provisions in residential transactions are capped at 3% of the purchase price (Cal. Civ. Code Section 1675). This does not apply to commercial transactions, but commercial PSAs should nonetheless include a liquidated damages provision that satisfies the "reasonable estimate of actual damages" standard.
- **New York:** New York courts strictly enforce liquidated damages provisions in commercial contracts. The deposit return for failed conditions should be clearly distinguished from liquidated damages for buyer default.
- **All jurisdictions:** Escrow agents in most states will not release disputed funds without either joint instructions or a court order. Include an interpleader provision in the escrow instructions.

---

## Distinction Between Conditions for Benefit of Buyer vs. Seller

### Preferred Position

The PSA should clearly identify which conditions are for the benefit of buyer and which are for the benefit of Seller. This classification determines which party has the right to waive the condition and which party has the right to terminate if the condition fails. Conditions should never be "floating" -- i.e., unassigned to either party's benefit.

**Cross-reference:** The Seller-Side Income Property form (Section 5.6) is the clearest model: "The conditions set forth in Sections 5.1 through 5.4 are for the exclusive benefit of Buyer and the conditions set forth in Section 5.5 are for the exclusive benefit of Seller."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Every condition should be expressly designated as being for the benefit of buyer, Seller, or both (mutual).
- A condition for the benefit of buyer can only be waived by buyer. A condition for the benefit of Seller can only be waived by Seller. A mutual condition can be waived by either party (with respect to its own obligation).
- The consequence of a failed mutual condition should be termination with deposit return, regardless of which party invokes the termination right.
- Buyer should resist any formulation that allows Seller to waive a buyer condition. For example, Seller should not be able to "cure" a failed buyer condition (e.g., by delivering Seller estoppels in lieu of tenant estoppels) without buyer's consent.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Certain conditions should be mutual to prevent either party from selectively invoking conditions as a pretext for termination.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept mutual classification only for truly mutual conditions (loan assumption, regulatory approvals, no injunction).
2. All other conditions should be classified as buyer or Seller conditions.
3. If a condition is mutual, specify that either party may terminate with deposit return, but neither party may compel the other to waive.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Misclassification of conditions can create unexpected results. A buyer condition that is inadvertently classified as mutual may allow Seller to waive the condition and force buyer to close.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** No material variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Courts will enforce the contractual classification of conditions. There is no common law rule that automatically assigns conditions to one party's benefit.

---

## Deemed Waiver

### Preferred Position

Buyer should understand and carefully evaluate any "deemed waiver" provision in the PSA. The most common deemed waiver provision states that, upon Closing, all conditions that were not satisfied are deemed waived. This is standard and generally acceptable, provided buyer preserves post-closing claims for breach of representations and warranties.

**Cross-reference:** The Meadows form (Sections 7.1 and 7.2) provides: "After the Closing, any such condition that has not been satisfied shall be treated as having been waived in writing." The ASB/Hardware Block form achieves a similar result through its anti-sandbagging provisions (Section 7.4).

### Key Negotiation Points

- Deemed waiver at Closing should not extinguish post-closing claims for breach of representations and warranties. Ensure the survival provisions expressly preserve claims for breaches discovered after Closing.
- Deemed waiver should not apply to conditions that cannot be satisfied at Closing due to Seller's fraud or intentional misconduct. Include a fraud carve-out.
- The deemed waiver should be limited to conditions precedent -- it should not extend to covenants, indemnities, or obligations that expressly survive Closing.
- Be cautious of "deemed waiver" provisions triggered by the passage of time rather than by Closing. For example, if buyer does not object to an estoppel certificate within 2 business days of receipt, the estoppel is deemed approved. These time-based deemed waivers require vigilant deadline tracking.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Deemed waiver at Closing is essential to achieve finality. Seller cannot be exposed to condition-based claims after conveying the Property.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept deemed waiver at Closing, but carve out fraud and intentional misrepresentation.
2. Accept deemed waiver at Closing, but preserve all rights under representations and warranties that survive Closing.
3. Accept time-based deemed waivers for procedural items (estoppel review, document review) with reasonable periods (3-5 business days, not 1-2).

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Deemed waiver provisions can inadvertently eliminate buyer's post-closing claims if not carefully drafted. The interaction between deemed waiver, the survival period, and the anti-sandbagging provisions must be analyzed as a single system.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** No material variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Courts will enforce deemed waiver provisions as written. Under the parol evidence rule, buyer cannot claim it did not intend to waive a condition if the PSA contains a deemed waiver provision and buyer proceeded to close.

---

## Material Adverse Change Definition and Threshold

### Preferred Position

If the PSA uses the term "Material Adverse Effect" or "Material Adverse Change" (MAC/MAE), buyer should insist on a detailed definition that sets objective thresholds and captures both quantitative and qualitative changes. The definition should be broad enough to capture any change that would materially affect buyer's investment thesis.

**Preferred definition:**

> "Material Adverse Effect" means any event, condition, change, occurrence, or circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate, (a) results in a diminution in the aggregate base rent payable under the Leases of more than [5]% from the amount reflected on the Rent Roll attached hereto, (b) results in physical damage to the Property exceeding [2]% of the Purchase Price, (c) results in the bankruptcy, insolvency, or cessation of business operations of any Major Tenant, (d) results in the commencement of condemnation or eminent domain proceedings affecting more than [X]% of the Property, (e) results in the discovery of environmental contamination requiring remediation costs in excess of [$X], or (f) otherwise has a material adverse effect on the value, use, operation, or income-producing capacity of the Property from and after the Closing.

**Cross-reference:** The ASB/Hardware Block form uses "Material Adverse Effect" throughout but defines it in the definitions article. The Pro-Buyer IL form (Section 14.02) uses a rent roll stability test as a specific MAC trigger and includes a percentage-based definition ("diminution in the aggregate base rent reflected on the Rent Roll of more than [X]%"). The UNICO Buyer Side form uses dollar thresholds for casualty ($500,000) without a general MAC definition.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Include both a catch-all qualitative test ("material adverse effect on the value, use, operation, or income-producing capacity") and specific quantitative triggers.
- Quantitative triggers should be calibrated to the deal size. For a $50M deal, a 5% rent diminution is $2.5M in value impact (at a 5% cap rate). For a $200M deal, the same percentage represents $10M.
- Resist carve-outs for "general economic conditions," "changes in interest rates," "changes in law," or "acts of God." These carve-outs, common in M&A, are inappropriate for single-asset real estate deals where the specific property's condition is the entire investment.
- The MAC definition should be "from and after the Closing" (forward-looking), not retrospective. Buyer is not trying to unwind the deal because of past events -- buyer is protecting against closing on an asset that has materially deteriorated.
- The ASB/Hardware Block form provides that changes that "cannot reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect from and after the Closing" are excluded from the bring-down condition. This is acceptable if the MAE threshold is properly set.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The MAC definition should be narrow to prevent buyer from using it as a pretext to renegotiate or terminate. Seller may argue for a higher threshold or fewer enumerated triggers.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a higher percentage threshold for the rent roll test (e.g., 10% instead of 5%), but retain the qualitative catch-all.
2. Accept a carve-out for changes caused by buyer's acts or omissions.
3. Accept a carve-out for changes resulting from property operations conducted in compliance with the pre-closing covenants.
4. Accept the elimination of specific quantitative triggers and rely solely on the qualitative "material adverse effect" standard, but only if the PSA includes a mandatory arbitration or expert determination process for MAC disputes.
5. Last resort: Accept a provision under which MAC disputes are resolved by an independent appraiser or other expert, with the cost borne by the losing party.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — The MAC definition is the gatekeeper for the MAC condition. A poorly defined MAC can render the condition meaningless (if the threshold is too high) or create frivolous termination rights (if the threshold is too low). The definition must be carefully calibrated to the deal.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Include tenant bankruptcy and occupancy decline as specific MAC triggers. Cap rate expansion of more than X basis points may also be appropriate.
- **Industrial:** Include environmental contamination and loss of material permits.
- **Retail:** Include anchor tenant departure, co-tenancy triggers, and sales decline exceeding a specified percentage.
- **Multifamily:** Include occupancy decline below a stated threshold and effective rent decline.
- **Data Center:** Include loss of power capacity, failure of cooling systems, and termination of interconnection agreements.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** New York courts have addressed MAC/MAE definitions extensively in the M&A context (see Hexion Specialty Chems. v. Huntsman Corp., Del. Ch. 2008, applied by analogy). These precedents support a durational requirement -- the adverse change must be expected to persist for a commercially reasonable period.
- **Delaware:** Many SPE sellers are Delaware LLCs. Delaware law (particularly Akorn v. Fresenius, Del. Ch. 2018) has developed a substantial body of MAC jurisprudence that may be applied by analogy to real estate transactions governed by Delaware law.
- **California/Illinois:** No specific MAC jurisprudence for real estate PSAs. Courts will enforce the contractual definition as written.
