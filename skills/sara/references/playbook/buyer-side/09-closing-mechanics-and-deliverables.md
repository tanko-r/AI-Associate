# Closing Mechanics and Deliverables — Buyer Playbook

This playbook addresses the Closing Mechanics and Deliverables provisions of a commercial real estate purchase and sale agreement from the **buyer/purchaser** perspective. It is designed for use by AI agents conducting contract review on behalf of institutional buyers acquiring income-producing commercial real estate ($50M+ transactions).

## Closing Date Structure

### Preferred Position

The Closing Date should be defined as an "on or before" date, giving the buyer flexibility to close early if conditions are met, while preserving the right to use the full time period. The buyer should retain unilateral extension rights (at least one, preferably two) with reasonable additional deposit requirements. The Closing Date should be set far enough from the Due Diligence Deadline to allow for title cure, lender processing, estoppel collection, and closing document preparation — typically 30-60 days post-diligence expiration for institutional deals.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Closing Date" means ____________, 20__, or such earlier date as may be agreed to by Buyer and Seller in writing. The Closing Date is subject to possible extensions as provided in Sections [cross-references].

The buyer should insist on the following extension rights:

1. **Mutual one-business-day extension right** — each party may extend one time by one Business Day upon delivery of notice and a nominal payment (e.g., $5,000 credited at Closing) per the UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 11.2.1).
2. **Buyer's additional extension option** — Buyer may extend the Closing Date one time for up to 20 Business Days upon depositing additional earnest money equal to 50% of the original Earnest Money Deposit, which becomes part of the Earnest Money Deposit (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.2.2).
3. **Closing Statement extension** — if the parties cannot agree on the Closing Statement at least 2 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, either party may extend the Closing Date to 2 Business Days after agreement is reached (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.8).
4. **Closing condition cure period extension** — the Closing Date should automatically extend to accommodate any 5-Business-Day cure period triggered by a condition failure notice (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 10.1).

### Key Negotiation Points

- Resist a "fixed date" closing with no extension rights. Institutional deals involve title clearance, lender requirements, estoppel collections, and entity formation that frequently require additional time.
- Ensure "time is of the essence" language, if present, is expressly qualified by the extension rights in the PSA. Unqualified time-is-of-the-essence clauses give the seller termination rights if closing is even one day late (Meadows form, Section 9.12).
- The buyer's extension right should be exercisable upon notice alone (or notice plus additional deposit), not subject to seller consent or satisfaction of conditions.
- Confirm that all other extension triggers throughout the PSA (title cure, casualty, condemnation, estoppel collection, closing statement disagreement) are cross-referenced in the Closing Date definition.
- The closing time should be stated explicitly (e.g., "3:00 p.m. local time") to avoid ambiguity about when wire transfers must be received and recordings must occur (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.3).
- Ensure the PSA addresses what happens if closing falls on a non-Business Day — the date should automatically roll to the next Business Day.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The Closing Date should be a hard date with no buyer extension rights or, at most, one short extension requiring a substantial additional nonrefundable deposit. Seller will resist "on or before" language, arguing it creates uncertainty in its own closing timeline and 1031 exchange planning.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept a single extension right of 15-20 Business Days with an additional refundable deposit (not nonrefundable) equal to 25-50% of the original Earnest Money Deposit that becomes part of the Earnest Money Deposit.
2. Accept a shorter extension (10 Business Days) with a deposit equal to 50% of the original Earnest Money Deposit, provided the deposit is fully applied to the Purchase Price at Closing.
3. If seller insists on no unilateral extension right, negotiate for automatic extensions tied to specific events: title cure periods, estoppel collection delays, closing statement disagreements, and casualty/condemnation notice periods.
4. Last resort: accept a fixed closing date but negotiate a mutual adjournment right of at least 5 Business Days upon written notice delivered at least 3 Business Days before the scheduled Closing Date.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Failure to close by the Closing Date, absent a valid extension, triggers a buyer default. In most forms, the earnest money deposit becomes liquidated damages payable to seller. Extension rights are critical protection against timing risks that are often outside the buyer's direct control (lender delays, title issues, estoppel collection).

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Data Center:** Allow additional time (45-60 days post-diligence) for complex infrastructure diligence, fiber/interconnection agreement reviews, and utility capacity confirmation.
- **Industrial/Logistics:** Portfolio or multi-parcel deals may need staggered closings or a master closing with sequential recordings across counties.
- **Multifamily:** If the deal involves HUD-insured loans or agency debt assumption, allow 90+ days for lender processing. The closing date should be tied to lender approval receipt.
- **Retail:** If anchor tenant estoppels or SNDA modifications are conditions to closing, build in adequate time beyond the estoppel deadline for negotiation of non-conforming estoppels.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Sit-down closings are customary. "Time of the essence" has specific legal meaning — once declared (typically by letter after initial adjournment), it is strictly enforced. Buyer should never agree to TOE at signing; negotiate that TOE can only be declared after a failed closing with 30 days' advance notice (NY Checklist).
- **Illinois:** Escrow closings are standard. The Title Company typically acts as escrow agent. Closing is often conditioned on the Title Company's commitment to issue the policy (IL Pro-Buyer form, Section 7.01).
- **California, Oregon, Washington:** Escrow closings through title companies are universal. Recording and disbursement typically occur on the same day.
- **Texas:** Escrow closings are standard. Title companies serve as escrow agents. Some counties have limited recording hours; confirm recording deadlines.
- **Florida:** Closings often occur at the offices of the buyer's title agent. Survey requirements differ from ALTA states.

## Closing Procedure (Escrow vs. Table Closing)

### Preferred Position

For institutional deals, the buyer should insist on an escrow closing through the title company/escrow agent. The PSA itself should serve as the escrow instructions, with supplementary instructions subordinate to the PSA terms. The escrow closing procedure should require that all funds and documents be deposited into escrow before the Deposit Deadline, after which the escrow agent records the deed, disburses funds, and distributes documents.

**Preferred sample language (per UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.3):**

> Provided that all funds and documents required under Sections [Seller's deliverables] and [Buyer's deliverables] below have been deposited into escrow with instructions to handle them in accordance with this Agreement, then no later than 3:00 pm [local time] on the Closing Date, (a) Escrow Agent shall (i) cause the Deed to be recorded, (ii) pay to Seller by Federal Reserve wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller, the Purchase Price (subject to adjustments), less any costs or other amounts to be paid by Seller at Closing pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and (iii) pay all appropriate payees the other costs and amounts to be paid at Closing.

The PSA should explicitly state that it serves as escrow instructions (UNICO forms, Section 11.11) and that in the event of conflict between the PSA and any supplementary escrow instructions, the PSA controls.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Require the escrow agent to execute the PSA or a joinder to acknowledge its escrow obligations and assumption of Section 6045(e) reporting responsibilities (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.12).
- The escrow agent should be the buyer's title company, not a third-party selected by seller (NY Checklist: "the escrow agent is the purchaser's title insurance company; and not the seller's attorney").
- Specify the deposit deadline time (typically 3:00 p.m. local time) and address "special" or late recordings if available in the jurisdiction.
- The escrow agent should invest deposited funds in federally insured or government securities accounts, with interest allocated per the PSA terms (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.10).
- Include escrow agent exculpation limited to willful misconduct or gross negligence (not simple negligence), and provide that the escrow agent may interplead funds to court if a dispute arises.
- Require that all seller net proceeds be disbursed only after recording confirmation, not merely upon deposit of documents.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller may prefer its own title company or attorney as escrow agent, particularly in New York sit-down closing scenarios. Seller may also push for concurrent (rather than sequential) recording and disbursement.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept seller's title company as escrow agent if the buyer can select the title underwriter for the owner's policy and the escrow agent agrees to issue the buyer's lender policy.
2. For New York sit-down closings, accept the format but insist on a pre-closing escrow for documents, with the closing itself being the final exchange of signatures, keys, and the recording of the deed.
3. Accept concurrent recording and disbursement where customary (most Western states), but require the escrow agent to obtain recording confirmation before end of business on the Closing Date.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Escrow closings reduce closing-day risk by separating document deposit from recording/disbursement. Table closings carry "gap" risk — the period between document delivery and recording during which a judgment lien, lis pendens, or other encumbrance could be filed against the property.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Portfolio deals:** May require multiple escrows across jurisdictions with a master closing coordination agreement.
- **Data Center:** Closing may require coordination with utility transfer timelines and interconnection agreement assignments.
- **Multifamily (agency debt):** Lender may require its own closing agent or specific escrow procedures that must be accommodated.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Sit-down (table) closings remain common, typically at seller's counsel or lender's counsel offices. Parties exchange original documents, wires are sent, and the deed is walked to recording. Gap indemnities from seller are critical.
- **Illinois:** Escrow closings through Chicago Title or similar. "New York style" closings also occur for large deals. Bulk sales certificates from the Illinois Department of Revenue may be required (IL Pro-Buyer form, Section 8.01(o)).
- **Western states (WA, OR, CA, CO, AZ):** Escrow closings are universal. Title companies handle all recording and disbursement.
- **Texas:** Escrow closings are standard. Title companies are regulated by the Texas Department of Insurance and use promulgated forms for certain aspects.

## Possession Delivery

### Preferred Position

Seller should deliver possession of the Property to Buyer on the Closing Date, subject only to the rights of tenants under the Leases. Possession delivery should include physical delivery of all keys, key cards, access codes, combinations, parking passes, and building management system credentials. Seller should be required to deliver possession free of any occupants other than tenants under Leases included in the Lease Assignment.

**Preferred sample language (adapted from Meadows form, Section 8.2):**

> Subject to the Leases, Seller shall transfer possession of the Property to Buyer on the Closing Date. Seller shall, on the Closing Date, deliver to Buyer the Leases, Contracts, Permits and any other plans and specifications, certificates, licenses and approvals relating to the Property in the possession of Seller, which shall become the property of Buyer on the Closing Date.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Possession should be concurrent with closing — resist any post-closing occupancy by seller or affiliated entities. If seller requires a leaseback, it should be documented as a separate lease agreement with market-rate rent and a hard termination date.
- Ensure the PSA addresses holdover tenants — seller should represent that no parties other than identified tenants have a right to possession (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 5.1.14).
- Require seller to deliver tenant notice letters on the Closing Date directing tenants to pay future rent to buyer (Meadows, Section 8.2; Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(j)).
- Buyer should have the right (not obligation) to send tenant notices after closing (NY Checklist).
- Physical delivery items should include: all keys, key cards, gate remotes, combinations, access codes, building management system passwords, elevator service keys, roof access keys, and utility room access.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller may need a brief transition period, particularly if seller's property management company is being terminated at closing. Seller may resist providing building management system credentials if they are proprietary to its management platform.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept a 1-3 Business Day transition period for property management handoff, but require seller to cooperate fully and at its own expense during this period.
2. If seller cannot deliver building management system credentials (e.g., proprietary cloud platform), require seller to cooperate in transferring all relevant data and configurations to buyer's platform within 15 Business Days post-closing, with a holdback or escrow to ensure compliance.
3. Accept joint tenant notice letters signed by both seller and buyer at closing.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Incomplete possession delivery can disrupt property operations, create security vulnerabilities, and delay buyer's lender requirements for insurance and property management setup.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Building management systems (BMS/BAS), security systems, parking garage controls, and elevator service keys are critical. Ensure delivery of HVAC control system access, fire alarm panel codes, and generator test records.
- **Industrial:** Confirm delivery of dock leveler keys, rail siding access, and any specialized loading equipment controls. If the property includes hazardous materials storage, ensure delivery of manifests and emergency response plans.
- **Retail:** Obtain common area lighting controls, monument sign access, and pylon sign controls. For enclosed malls, ensure delivery of common area HVAC controls, escalator maintenance records, and food court utility shutoffs.
- **Multifamily:** Unit key inventories, master key systems, amenity access systems (pool, fitness, package lockers), and property management software data exports are essential.
- **Data Center:** Critical to obtain DCIM (Data Center Infrastructure Management) system access, BMS/EMS credentials, UPS and generator control system access, security system credentials (mantrap, biometric), and all infrastructure monitoring dashboards.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Possession delivery is generally governed by contract, not statute. The critical issue is ensuring the PSA is comprehensive in defining what "possession" includes.
- **New York:** Security deposit transfer requirements are governed by NY GOL Section 7-105, which requires transfer of deposits to buyer and written notice to tenants.

## Seller's Closing Deliverables

### Preferred Position

The buyer should require an exhaustive list of seller closing deliverables, all of which should be conditions precedent to buyer's obligation to close. Each deliverable should be in a form attached as an exhibit to the PSA (negotiated at signing), and the PSA should require delivery of documents "substantially in the form" of the exhibits. All documents requiring recording must be reviewed and approved by the title company prior to closing.

The comprehensive deliverables list should include all of the following (cross-referencing the source forms):

### Key Negotiation Points

The following is the complete list of seller closing deliverables that the buyer should require, organized by category:

**A. Conveyance Documents**

1. **Deed** — Special warranty deed (or bargain and sale deed with covenants against grantor's acts in New York), duly executed and acknowledged, in recordable form, conveying fee simple title subject only to Permitted Exceptions. Form should be attached as an exhibit (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.4.1; IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(a); NY Checklist: Deed section). Buyer should resist quitclaim deeds or deeds with limited warranties. The deed should include a lien law clause where applicable (NY Checklist).

2. **Bill of Sale** — Conveying all Personal Property, with representations that seller owns the property, it is free of liens, and describing its condition (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.4.4; Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(b); IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(c)). Should warrant good and marketable title to personal property free and clear of all encumbrances.

3. **Assignment and Assumption of Leases** — Two counterparts executed by seller, assigning all of seller's landlord interest in the Leases, together with an indemnity from seller for obligations accruing before closing (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.4.2; IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(e); NY Checklist: Assignment and Assumption of Leases section). Must include assignment of security deposits.

4. **Assignment and Assumption of Contracts** — Two counterparts executed by seller, assigning seller's interest in the Assumed Contracts, with proof of payment through closing and an indemnity for pre-closing obligations (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.4.3; IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(f); NY Checklist: Assignment and Assumption of Contracts section).

5. **Assignment and Assumption of Intangible Property** — Two counterparts assigning all intangible property (trade names, websites, permits, warranties, plans, specifications) (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(d)). Not all forms include this as a separate document; ensure it is covered either here or in the general assignment.

**B. Tax and Regulatory Documents**

6. **FIRPTA Certificate** — Non-foreign person affidavit pursuant to Section 1445(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, sworn by seller, stating seller is not a "foreign person" within the meaning of Section 1445(f)(3) (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.4.5; Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(g); IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(i); Detailed Seller Form, Section 8.3(d)). Buyer is entitled to rely on this certificate in lieu of withholding. If seller cannot provide this certificate, buyer must withhold 15% of the purchase price.

7. **State/Local Transfer Tax Forms** — All transfer tax declarations, real estate excise tax affidavits, and related forms required by the applicable jurisdiction, executed by seller (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(b); Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(a)). In New York, this includes Form TP-584, NYC-RPT (if applicable), and Credit Line Mortgage Certificate (NY Checklist: Seller Tax Forms section).

8. **State Withholding Certificate** — Where applicable, certificates exempting the transaction from state income tax withholding requirements, or proper withholding arrangements.

**C. Title and Diligence Documents**

9. **Owner's Title Affidavit** — In the form required by the title company, addressing mechanics' liens, parties in possession, and other standard title exceptions to enable issuance of the title policy (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.4.6; IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(v)).

10. **Gap Indemnity** — Seller's indemnity covering the "gap" period between the last title search and recording of the deed, in a form acceptable to seller and the title company (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(u)). Critical for table closings in New York and Illinois.

11. **ALTA Statement** — In a form acceptable to seller and the title company (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(v)).

12. **Entity Authority Documents** — Such entity formation documents, authorizations, certificates of good standing, incumbency certificates, and resolutions as the title company and escrow agent may require to verify seller's capacity and authority to execute and deliver the closing documents (UNICO forms, Section 11.4.6; Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(h); IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(r); Detailed Seller Form, Section 8.3(f)).

**D. Operational Documents**

13. **Closing Certificate / Bring-Down Certificate** — A certificate executed by seller re-certifying that all representations and warranties in the PSA remain true, correct, and complete in all material respects as of the Closing Date (Meadows, Section 8.1(v); IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(w); Detailed Seller Form, Section 8.3(e)). If there are exceptions, they should be disclosed in the certificate, and the buyer should retain the right to evaluate whether any exception constitutes a failure of a closing condition.

14. **Tenant Notice Letters** — Notices signed by seller (and co-signed by buyer where required) to each tenant advising of the sale, the new ownership, and directing future rent payments to buyer at buyer's designated address (Meadows, Section 8.2; Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(j); IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(g); NY Checklist: Assignment and Assumption of Leases section).

15. **Updated Rent Roll** — Dated as of the Closing Date and certified by seller as true, correct, and complete in all material respects (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 7.6; IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(x); Detailed Seller Form, Section 8.3(h)).

16. **Original Leases and Contracts** — Originals (or copies if originals are not in seller's possession or control) of all Leases, amendments, guaranties, and Assumed Contracts (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.4.7; Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(d), (f); IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(l), (m)).

17. **Tenant Estoppel Certificates** — All originals of conforming tenant estoppel certificates not previously delivered to buyer (Detailed Seller Form, Section 8.3(l); IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(dd)).

18. **Keys, Key Cards, and Access Items** — All keys, key cards, combinations, access codes, gate remotes, and related access items for all portions of the Property (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.4.7; IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(q); NY Checklist: Other Necessary Seller Closing Deliverables section).

19. **Plans, Specifications, and Records** — Originals or copies of all plans, specifications, surveys, technical manuals, and similar materials in seller's possession or control (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(m); NY Checklist).

20. **Books and Records** — Originals or copies of all books and records relating to the operation of the Property maintained by seller (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(p)).

21. **Permits and Licenses** — Originals or copies of all permits, licenses, certificates of occupancy, and approvals in seller's possession or control (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(q)).

22. **Evidence of Contract Terminations** — Evidence of termination of all service contracts that buyer has not elected to assume, together with proof of payment in full by seller of any termination costs and release of counterparties (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(bb)).

23. **Evidence of Management Agreement Termination** — Evidence of termination of the property management agreement and all other agreements with seller affiliates, together with proof of payment in full of all liabilities, fees, costs, and expenses (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(cc); NY Checklist: Other Necessary Seller Closing Deliverables section). Include a lien waiver from the property manager (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(ee)).

24. **Security Deposit Transfer** — Transfer of all cash security deposits, together with letter of credit assignments where applicable (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(o)).

**E. Closing Administration**

25. **Closing Statement** — Seller-approved closing statement setting forth the Purchase Price, prorations, adjustments, credits, and closing costs (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.8; Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(i); IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(z)).

26. **Broker Lien Waivers** — Where required, waivers from all brokers confirming that commissions have been paid or will be paid from closing proceeds and releasing any lien claims against the Property.

27. **Existing Loan Payoff/Assumption Documents** — If applicable, payoff letters and release documents for existing debt, or assumption documents required by the existing lender (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.4 optional text).

28. **Catch-All** — "All other documents reasonably necessary or otherwise required by the Escrow Agent or the Title Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement" (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(ff); Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(k)).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The deliverables list is too long; many items are duplicative of diligence materials already provided; seller should not be required to deliver items "not in seller's possession or control"; catch-all provisions give buyer a backdoor closing condition.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept "to the extent in Seller's possession or control" qualifiers on operational documents (leases, contracts, plans, records), but not on conveyance documents, tax forms, or certificates that seller must create and execute.
2. Accept delivery of certain items (original leases, plans, keys) "outside of escrow" rather than through escrow, provided delivery occurs concurrently with closing (UNICO forms, Section 11.4.7).
3. Limit the catch-all to items "customarily required" rather than "reasonably required" if seller insists, but ensure the provision includes items required by the title company and buyer's lender.
4. If seller resists the broker lien waiver, require seller to indemnify buyer against any broker claims and authorize the escrow agent to pay commissions from seller's proceeds.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — Missing or defective closing deliverables can result in title defects, FIRPTA withholding liability, failure of title insurance conditions, inability to enforce leases, and post-closing operational disruption. Every deliverable on this list serves a specific legal or operational purpose. The buyer should refuse to close if any material deliverable is missing.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office/Industrial:** Ensure delivery of all building management system documentation, elevator maintenance contracts, and life safety system certifications.
- **Retail:** Require delivery of REA estoppels, pad site agreements, and outparcel documentation. Confirm delivery of common area maintenance records and reconciliation workpapers.
- **Multifamily:** Require delivery of Section 8/housing voucher documentation, rent stabilization records (if applicable), lead paint disclosures, and mold remediation records.
- **Data Center:** Require delivery of all infrastructure warranties (UPS, generators, CRAC units, fire suppression), utility agreements, fiber IRU agreements, interconnection agreements, and SLA documentation.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Deed is typically a bargain and sale deed with covenants against grantor's acts, with a lien law clause. Transfer tax forms include Form TP-584 and NYC-RPT for New York City properties. Seller must provide a Certificate of Exemption from Payment of Estimated Personal Income Tax (NY Checklist).
- **Illinois:** Bulk sales certificates from the Illinois Department of Revenue (and Cook County/City of Chicago if applicable) or a bulk sales escrow are required (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(o)). Plat Act Affidavit may be required (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(p)). Transfer tax declarations for state and local authorities.
- **Washington:** Real Estate Excise Tax Affidavit is required from both buyer and seller (Seller Income Property, Sections 8.3(a), 8.4(b)). Consumer use tax return may be required from buyer for personal property transfer (Seller Income Property, Section 8.4(e)).
- **Oregon:** Oregon-specific statutory land use disclaimer must be included in the deed (Meadows, Section 9.17).
- **California:** Documentary transfer tax forms. County-specific requirements vary. Some counties require preliminary change of ownership reports (PCOR).
- **Texas:** Real estate excise taxes are not imposed, but other transfer-related filings may apply.

## Buyer's Closing Deliverables

### Preferred Position

The buyer's closing deliverables should be limited to the minimum required to consummate the transaction. The buyer should resist expansive catch-all provisions that could give seller a basis to refuse to close.

The standard buyer deliverables include:

1. **Purchase Price** — The balance of the Purchase Price (less Earnest Money Deposit credit, plus/minus prorations and adjustments) in immediately available federal funds wired to the escrow agent (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.5.1; Detailed Seller Form, Section 8.4(a)).

2. **Assumption Agreements** — Two counterparts each of the Assignment and Assumption of Leases, Assignment and Assumption of Contracts, and Bill of Sale, executed by buyer (UNICO Buyer Side, Sections 11.5.2-11.5.4; IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.02).

3. **Entity Authority Documents** — Such evidence as the title company may reasonably require as to buyer's status, capacity, and authority (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.5.5; IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.02(g)).

4. **Transfer Tax Forms** — Buyer's portion of any required transfer tax declarations (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.02(e); Seller Income Property, Section 8.4(b)).

5. **Closing Statement** — Buyer-approved closing statement (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.02(j)).

6. **Tenant Notice Letters** — Where the form requires buyer co-signature (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.02(i)).

7. **Catch-All** — Documents reasonably or customarily required by the title company or escrow agent (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.5.5).

### Key Negotiation Points

- Resist any requirement for buyer to deliver a closing certificate re-certifying buyer's representations and warranties. Unlike seller's reps (which address property condition and title), buyer's reps are limited to authority and non-foreign person status, which do not change between signing and closing.
- If a buyer closing certificate is required (as in Meadows, Section 8.1), ensure it is limited to re-certifying matters within buyer's control and is "in all material respects."
- Ensure the purchase price wire deadline is reasonable — if funds are not received by the stated time (e.g., 2:00 p.m. local time), buyer should have until end of business to cure before being in default. The Detailed Seller Form makes buyer responsible for any interest costs caused by late wires (Section 8.4(a)); resist this provision.
- Buyer should not be required to deliver any documents that impose obligations beyond those in the PSA.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller may require buyer to deliver a bring-down certificate, additional entity documents, and proof of financing.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept a buyer bring-down certificate limited to re-certifying representations and warranties made in the PSA (no new representations).
2. Accept reasonable entity authority documents requested by the title company but resist open-ended requests from seller's counsel.
3. Never agree to provide proof of financing as a closing deliverable — financing is the buyer's concern, and the PSA should be clear that buyer's ability to obtain financing is not a condition to closing (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 9.3).

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Buyer's closing deliverables are straightforward and within buyer's control. The primary risk is wire transfer timing — ensure adequate time and backup procedures.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily (agency debt assumption):** Buyer may need to deliver extensive lender-required documents including borrower entity formation documents, guarantor financial statements, management agreements, and environmental indemnities.
- **Data Center:** Buyer may need to deliver evidence of insurance meeting specific infrastructure requirements.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Buyer may need to execute TP-584 and NYC-RPT transfer tax forms. Mortgage recording tax affidavits if buyer is taking new financing.
- **Illinois:** Buyer must execute state and local transfer tax declarations (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.02(e)).
- **Washington:** Buyer must execute Real Estate Excise Tax Affidavit and consumer use tax return (Seller Income Property, Sections 8.4(b), (e)).

---

## Closing Costs Allocation

### Preferred Position

The buyer should negotiate for the most favorable allocation of closing costs. The standard institutional allocation (per UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.6) should serve as baseline:

**Seller pays:**
- 50% of escrow agent's escrow fee
- Standard coverage portion of the owner's title insurance policy premium (and related sales tax)
- Cost of recording the deed
- Seller's broker commissions
- All transfer taxes, documentary stamp taxes, and real estate excise taxes
- Additional costs customarily charged to sellers in the applicable jurisdiction

**Buyer pays:**
- 50% of escrow agent's escrow fee
- Extended coverage portion (ALTA) of the owner's title policy premium, plus all endorsements and related sales tax
- Buyer's broker commissions (if any)
- Survey costs (updates and new surveys)
- All due diligence costs (Phase I, Phase II, engineering, zoning reviews)
- Buyer's lender title policy premium
- Buyer's own legal fees
- Additional costs customarily charged to buyers in the applicable jurisdiction

**Each party pays:**
- Its own legal fees and expenses

### Key Negotiation Points

- The single most significant cost item is the transfer tax. In high-transfer-tax jurisdictions (New York City, Chicago, Miami-Dade, San Francisco), the transfer tax on a $50M+ deal can exceed $1M. Buyer should insist seller pays all transfer taxes.
- Title insurance premium allocation varies by jurisdiction and custom. The UNICO approach (seller pays standard, buyer pays extended coverage increment and endorsements) is fair and widely accepted.
- Seller should pay for recording the deed because the deed is seller's conveyance instrument. Buyer should pay for recording any mortgage or other buyer financing documents.
- Buyer should always pay its own survey costs, as the buyer controls the scope and surveyor selection (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.6.3).
- The "customary charges" fallback covers items not specifically allocated — this clause should reference the custom in the state and county where the Property is located (UNICO forms, Sections 11.6.2-11.6.3).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller may try to shift transfer taxes to buyer, split them 50/50, or allocate all title insurance costs to buyer. In seller's market conditions, seller may insist that buyer pay all closing costs other than seller's legal fees and broker commissions.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept a 50/50 split of transfer taxes if seller will not pay 100%.
2. Accept buyer paying the full owner's title policy premium (standard and extended) if seller pays all transfer taxes.
3. Accept "closing costs allocated per local custom" as a fallback, but only if the local custom has been verified by local counsel and is favorable or neutral.
4. Never accept buyer paying seller's broker commission or seller's legal fees.

Note the Seller Side form (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.6) shifts deed recording costs to buyer and has a narrower scope of seller closing costs. Buyer should push back to the Buyer Side allocation.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Closing cost allocation is a pure economic negotiation point. The amounts can be material in high-transfer-tax jurisdictions. On a $100M deal in New York City, combined state and city transfer taxes can reach approximately $3.5M.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Transfer tax rates are property-value-based, not asset-type-based, in most jurisdictions. However, some jurisdictions impose additional taxes on certain categories (e.g., commercial rent tax in NYC, mansion tax for high-value residential).
- **Data Center:** Sales/use tax on personal property (equipment, infrastructure) can be significant. Ensure the allocation addresses who pays sales tax on the Personal Property component of the transaction.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Real Property Transfer Tax (NYS, 0.4% up to $3M, 0.65% above) plus NYC Real Property Transfer Tax (1.425% for commercial properties above $500K). NYC also imposes a "mansion tax" on residential properties above $1M. Custom is seller pays NYS and NYC transfer taxes.
- **New York City:** The combined transfer tax burden is approximately 2.075% for commercial properties, making it one of the highest in the nation.
- **Illinois/Chicago:** Illinois transfer tax ($0.50 per $500 of value) plus County transfer tax ($0.25 per $500) plus City of Chicago transfer tax ($3.75 per $500 on commercial transfers, with higher rates for transfers above $1M). Custom varies; negotiate explicitly.
- **Washington:** Real Estate Excise Tax (REET) is graduated: 1.1% up to $500K, 1.28% from $500K to $1.5M, 2.75% from $1.5M to $3M, and 3.0% above $3M. Custom is seller pays REET (Seller Income Property, Section 8.5).
- **California:** Documentary transfer tax varies by county and city. Some cities impose additional transfer taxes (e.g., San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland). Custom is typically seller pays.
- **Oregon:** No general transfer tax (one of few states). Buyer may benefit from this in Portland/metro area deals.
- **Texas:** No state transfer tax. Minimal recording fees.
- **Florida:** Documentary stamp tax at $0.70 per $100 (except Miami-Dade at $0.60 per $100 plus surtax). Custom is seller pays.

## Mutual Deliverables

### Preferred Position

Certain deliverables should be executed by both parties and are properly classified as mutual obligations:

1. **Closing Statement** — Both parties must approve the final closing statement. The preliminary statement should be prepared by the escrow agent and submitted to both parties at least 5 Business Days prior to closing. The parties should use reasonable, diligent, and good faith efforts to agree on the final statement at least 2 Business Days prior to closing (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.8).

2. **Escrow Instructions** — The PSA itself serves as escrow instructions. Any supplementary instructions must be consistent with the PSA, and in the event of conflict, the PSA controls (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.11).

3. **Transfer Tax Forms** — In many jurisdictions, both buyer and seller must execute transfer tax declarations (IL Pro-Buyer; Seller Income Property).

4. **1031 Exchange Cooperation** — Each party agrees to cooperate with the other's Section 1031 exchange, provided the cooperating party incurs no additional liability or expense and the Closing Date is not extended or accelerated (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 16.7).

5. **Section 6045(e) Reporting** — Both parties designate the escrow agent as the Reporting Person for IRS information reporting and agree to provide taxpayer identification numbers, W-9 forms, and related certifications (UNICO Buyer Side, Sections 11.12.1-11.12.2).

### Key Negotiation Points

- The closing statement timeline (5 days preliminary, 2 days final) is important — if the parties cannot agree, the Closing Date should automatically extend rather than creating a default scenario.
- 1031 exchange cooperation should be truly reciprocal but should never require the cooperating party to take title to exchange property, incur additional expense, or delay the Closing Date.
- Ensure the escrow instructions subordination clause is clear: PSA controls over escrow instructions, not the reverse.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Mutual deliverables are generally non-controversial. The main negotiation points are:

1. **Closing statement timeline:** Seller may want a shorter review period. Minimum acceptable is 3 Business Days for preliminary statement, 1 Business Day for final agreement.
2. **1031 cooperation:** Either party may try to impose costs on the other. Hold firm that cooperation is "at no cost or expense to the cooperating party."

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Mutual deliverables are standard and rarely disputed at closing.

### Asset-Type Variations

No material variations by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Section 6045(e) reporting is a federal requirement applicable everywhere. State-specific transfer tax forms vary and should be identified by local counsel during the PSA negotiation.

---

## Post-Closing Obligations

### Preferred Position

The PSA should impose robust post-closing obligations on seller to ensure a smooth transition of property operations. These obligations should expressly survive closing. The key post-closing obligations include:

**A. Proration Reconciliation and True-Up**

The buyer should insist on a meaningful reconciliation period — 90 days for standard prorations and up to 120 days for operating expense pass-through reconciliations. Either party should be entitled to adjustments upon discovery of errors, with a written notice requirement specifying the items and reasons for adjustment (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.9).

For operating expense pass-throughs under the Leases, the Meadows form provides a two-tier approach (Section 8.5):
- General prorations: true-up within 60 days based on actual amounts.
- Operating expense pass-throughs: Seller prepares and delivers a full reconciliation schedule within 120 days after closing, including general ledger, supporting documentation, and base year determinations.

The Seller Income Property form provides a similar approach (Section 8.7): Seller prepares the final operating expense pass-through calculation within 60 days after closing; buyer has 60 days to review.

**B. Transition Cooperation**

Seller should cooperate with buyer's property management transition for a period of at least 30 days post-closing, including:
- Making seller's property managers and accounting personnel available to answer questions
- Assisting with utility account transfers
- Providing access to historical operating data and vendor information
- Forwarding mail and communications received by seller that relate to the Property

**C. Post-Closing Access to Books and Records**

Buyer should be provided access to seller's books and records relating to the Property for at least one year after closing to confirm proration calculations and audit historical operations (Meadows, Section 8.6; UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.9). Conversely, seller should have access to buyer's post-closing records to confirm proration true-ups.

**D. Security Deposit Transfer**

All cash security deposits must be transferred or credited to buyer at closing. Letters of credit must be transferred and re-issued in buyer's name (Meadows, Section 8.4(b)). If a letter of credit transfer requires the issuing bank's cooperation, seller should use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the transfer within 15 Business Days after closing, with a holdback to secure performance.

**E. Delinquent Rent Collections**

The PSA should address the priority of application for rent collected post-closing from tenants who were delinquent at closing. Buyer's preferred waterfall (per Meadows, Section 8.4(b)):
1. First, to current month rent owed to buyer
2. Second, to the month in which closing occurred (prorated)
3. Third, to arrearages in reverse chronological order, remitting seller's share after deducting reasonable collection costs

Buyer should have the obligation to bill and attempt to collect delinquent rents in the ordinary course but should not be required to engage collection agencies or take legal action (Meadows, Section 8.4(b)). Seller should retain the right to pursue delinquent tenants directly but without the right to terminate any lease or evict any tenant.

**F. Mail Forwarding**

Seller should forward to buyer all mail and communications received after closing that relate to the Property, for a period of at least 6 months (preferably 12 months).

**G. Further Assurances**

Both parties should agree to execute and deliver additional documents as may be reasonably necessary to complete the transactions contemplated by the PSA (Meadows, Section 9.6; Seller Income Property, Section 29).

### Key Negotiation Points

- The reconciliation deadline is critical — buyer should insist that failure to request an adjustment within the deadline makes the closing statement binding and conclusive (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.9). This creates finality for both parties.
- Until final reconciliation, buyer's representatives and auditors should be afforded reasonable access during normal business hours to seller's books and records (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.9).
- Security deposit transfer must be complete at closing — buyer should not close if cash deposits are not credited and letter of credit transfers are not initiated.
- Delinquent rent collection priorities are often heavily negotiated. Buyer should never agree to apply collected rent to seller's arrearages before buyer's current obligations are satisfied.
- Post-closing cooperation obligations should be at seller's expense (not buyer's) to the extent they relate to seller's obligations.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Post-closing obligations should be minimal and time-limited. Seller will resist open-ended cooperation requirements, will want a short reconciliation period, and will seek to limit access to books and records.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept 60 days (instead of 90) for standard proration reconciliation, but insist on 120 days for operating expense pass-throughs.
2. Accept 6 months (instead of 12) for post-closing access to seller's books and records, but insist on at least 1 year for any audit-related access.
3. Accept that post-closing cooperation is "reasonable" rather than open-ended, but define specific obligations (utility transfers, mail forwarding, manager transition).
4. Accept that delinquent rent collected by buyer is applied first to buyer's current obligations and then to seller's arrearages, but only after deduction of buyer's actual collection costs.
5. If seller insists on dissolving its entity shortly after closing, negotiate for a post-closing escrow (1-3% of Purchase Price) to secure proration reconciliation obligations and representation survival.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Post-closing obligations directly affect the economics of the transaction. Incorrect prorations on a $50M+ deal with a large tenant roster can produce six-figure adjustments. Failure to properly transfer security deposits can create immediate landlord-tenant law liability. Incomplete transition cooperation can disrupt property operations and damage tenant relationships.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Operating expense reconciliations are the most complex due to multi-tenant pass-through structures with different base years and expense stops. Require detailed general ledger access.
- **Industrial:** Simpler pass-through structures (typically NNN), but CAM reconciliations for multi-tenant industrial parks can be complex.
- **Retail:** REA reconciliation adds another layer — CAM charges under the REA must be reconciled separately from individual lease pass-throughs. Percentage rent audits for the closing year must be addressed.
- **Multifamily:** Security deposit transfer is the most significant issue due to the volume of deposits. Utility transfer (if master-metered) requires coordination with utility providers.
- **Data Center:** Power cost reconciliations and infrastructure maintenance cost pass-throughs add complexity. Ensure access to metering data and infrastructure cost records.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Security deposit transfer is governed by NY GOL Section 7-105. Seller must transfer deposits within 5 days of closing and notify tenants in writing. Failure to comply creates statutory liability for the new owner.
- **California:** Security deposit transfer is governed by Cal. Civ. Code Section 1950.7. The new owner assumes liability for security deposits regardless of whether they were actually transferred.
- **Illinois:** The Illinois Security Deposit Return Act governs security deposit handling and transfer. Bulk sales clearance may be required post-closing.
- **All jurisdictions:** The Further Assurances clause should survive closing indefinitely (or at least for the same period as representation survival).

## Closing Statement Mechanics

### Preferred Position

The closing statement process should be structured to ensure transparency and adequate review time:

1. **Preliminary Statement:** Escrow agent prepares and distributes a preliminary closing statement at least 5 Business Days before closing.
2. **Review Period:** Both parties review and provide comments.
3. **Final Statement:** Parties use reasonable, diligent, and good faith efforts to agree on the final statement at least 2 Business Days before closing.
4. **Extension Trigger:** If agreement cannot be reached, either party may extend the Closing Date to 2 Business Days after agreement is reached (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.8).
5. **Tentative Prorations:** Items that cannot be finally determined at closing are tentatively prorated based on the best available data and adjusted post-closing (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.9).

### Key Negotiation Points

- The proration cut-off time is important and varies by form. The UNICO Buyer Side uses "11:59 pm [local time] on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date," meaning buyer is deemed to own the Property for the entire Closing Date (Section 11.7.1). This is the buyer's preferred position. The Detailed Seller Form uses "12:01 a.m. on the date on which the Closing occurs" (Section 8.4), which achieves the same result.
- The method of proration should be based on actual days in the month and a 365-day year, not a 30/360 convention (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.7.2).
- Insurance policies should not be prorated — buyer arranges its own insurance (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.7.3). Seller should be credited for any transferable utility deposits.
- Utilities should be read on the Closing Date. If accounts cannot be transferred on the Closing Date, utility charges should be prorated outside of escrow within 60 days (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.7.3).
- Real estate tax prorations should be based on the most recent tax bill. If the current year's tax rate is not yet fixed, prorate based on the prior year's rate applied to the latest assessment, with a true-up when actual bills are issued (Seller Income Property, Section 8.6).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller may want a shorter review period or may resist the closing statement extension trigger. Seller may also push for a "day of closing" proration that gives seller credit for the closing day income.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept 3 Business Days for preliminary statement and 1 Business Day for final agreement, but preserve the extension trigger.
2. Accept a "day of closing" proration convention (seller receives income for closing day) only if buyer also avoids responsibility for closing day expenses. This is less common and should be resisted.
3. If seller resists the closing statement extension trigger, accept a provision that closing proceeds on the closing date using the preliminary statement, with a mandatory true-up within 30 days.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Closing statement errors on large deals produce material financial exposure. The reconciliation mechanism and deadlines are the safety net.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office/Retail:** Operating expense pass-through reconciliations are the most complex proration items.
- **Multifamily:** Prorations are simpler (gross rents, utilities, taxes) but the volume of individual tenant accounts increases administrative burden.
- **Industrial (NNN):** Minimal prorations if tenants pay all expenses directly. Focus on CAM reconciliation for multi-tenant parks.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Proration conventions are contractual, not statutory. Ensure the PSA is explicit about the cut-off time, calculation method, and reconciliation deadline.

## Escrow Agent Provisions

### Preferred Position

The escrow agent should be the buyer's title company. The PSA should include standard escrow agent provisions addressing:

1. **Limited Role:** Escrow agent acts as depository only, not responsible for the sufficiency, correctness, or genuineness of documents (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.10).
2. **Liability Standard:** No liability except for willful misconduct or gross negligence.
3. **Dispute Resolution:** If a dispute arises, escrow agent may interplead funds to court (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.10).
4. **Investment:** Escrow agent invests funds in federally insured accounts or government securities.
5. **PSA Controls:** The PSA serves as escrow instructions; supplementary instructions are subordinate (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 11.11).

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure escrow agent is the title company selected by buyer, not seller's attorney (NY Checklist).
- Interest on escrowed funds should be for buyer's account prior to closing (Seller Income Property, Section 9.2).
- The escrow agent should agree to serve as the Section 6045(e) Reporting Person.
- The escrow agent should not charge separate escrow fees beyond the standard title closing fee, unless split 50/50 between the parties.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Generally non-controversial. Accept seller's title company as escrow agent if buyer selects the title underwriter.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Standard provisions with minimal variation across deals.

### Asset-Type Variations

No material variations by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Seller's attorney often acts as escrow agent for the down payment deposit. Buyer should insist on the title company holding the deposit.
- **All other jurisdictions:** Title company as escrow agent is standard.
