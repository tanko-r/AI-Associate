# Covenants and Interim Operating Obligations — Buyer Playbook

This playbook addresses the Covenants and Interim Operating Obligations provisions of a commercial real estate purchase and sale agreement from the **buyer/purchaser** perspective. It is designed for use by AI agents conducting contract review on behalf of institutional buyers acquiring income-producing commercial real estate ($50M+ transactions). The interim period between signing and closing is among the highest-risk phases of any acquisition: the buyer has committed earnest money and expended significant diligence resources, yet has no control over the property. These covenants are the buyer's primary mechanism for preserving deal value during that gap.

## General Maintenance and Operation Standard

### Preferred Position

Seller should be required to maintain and operate the Property in substantially the same manner and condition as existed on the Effective Date, in accordance with sound property management practices, in the ordinary course of business, and in compliance with all applicable laws, the Leases, and the Assumed Contracts. The standard should be affirmative (requiring specific conduct) rather than merely negative (prohibiting certain actions). The covenant should run from the Effective Date through the Closing Date, with no carve-outs for the due diligence period.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 9.1, strengthened):**

> "From the Effective Date through the Closing Date, Seller shall (a) maintain and operate the Property in substantially the same manner and condition as prior to the Effective Date, in accordance with prudent property management practices and in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (b) keep the Property in good repair, working order, and sound condition, subject only to reasonable wear and tear and casualty damage governed by [Casualty Section], (c) perform when due all of Seller's obligations under the Leases, the Contracts, and the Permits in accordance with their terms and all applicable laws, and (d) not defer any maintenance, repairs, or capital expenditures that would otherwise be performed in the ordinary course of business."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The standard should reference "substantially the same manner and condition" — not merely "ordinary course," which is ambiguous and gives Seller wide latitude to reduce operating standards in a declining market.
- Require compliance with "prudent property management practices" or "institutional standards" to set an objective benchmark beyond Seller's historical conduct, which may have been substandard.
- The covenant must be absolute (not qualified by Seller's knowledge or "commercially reasonable efforts").
- Include an express prohibition on deferring maintenance or capital expenditures. Sellers approaching a sale commonly defer spending, which degrades property condition and shifts costs to the buyer.
- Require Seller to keep the Property staffed at current levels and not reduce on-site management presence.
- Cross-reference: The UNICO Buyer Side (Section 9.1) uses "maintain and operate the Property in the same manner as prior to the Effective Date pursuant to its normal course of business" — this is acceptable but should be strengthened with the "sound property management practices" qualifier found in the Meadows form (Section 6.1).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The standard should be "ordinary course of business" with a carve-out for reasonable wear and tear, casualty, and force majeure. Seller will resist any obligation to make capital expenditures or improvements beyond what Seller would otherwise make in its normal operations, and will insist on a materiality qualifier.

**Fallback chain (in priority order):**

1. Accept "ordinary course of business consistent with past practice" but insist on the "sound property management practices" overlay. Add a specific prohibition on deferring maintenance spending below trailing-twelve-month averages.
2. Accept a "commercially reasonable" qualifier if paired with objective benchmarks: (a) operating expenditures shall not fall below 90% of the trailing-twelve-month average without buyer consent, and (b) Seller shall maintain all required governmental permits and licenses.
3. Accept "reasonable wear and tear" and "casualty" carve-outs, but require that Seller promptly notify Buyer of any damage or deterioration that would cost more than $25,000 to repair (adjust threshold for deal size).
4. If Seller insists on a materiality threshold for repair obligations, cap it at $50,000 per occurrence / $150,000 aggregate (or 0.1% of Purchase Price, whichever is less), with amounts above the threshold requiring Buyer consent but not excusing Seller from the obligation.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Failure to maintain property condition during the interim period is one of the most common sources of post-closing disputes. If the operating standard is vague, the buyer inherits deferred maintenance, tenant service complaints, and potential lease defaults by landlord. The remedy at closing is limited because most PSAs provide only for termination or closing with knowledge — not for specific performance of maintenance obligations.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Focus on HVAC maintenance, elevator service contracts, lobby and common area upkeep, janitorial standards, and life safety system testing. Require Seller to continue any ongoing facade maintenance or window washing programs.
- **Industrial:** Focus on roof maintenance, dock leveler and door maintenance, truck court and parking lot condition, and fire suppression system testing. Industrial properties with deferred roof maintenance can result in six- and seven-figure capital liabilities.
- **Retail:** Focus on parking lot maintenance (sweeping, striping, seal-coating), signage maintenance, CAM-funded improvements in progress, and holiday decoration programs (if applicable to timing).
- **Multifamily:** Focus on unit turnover standards, appliance replacement cadence, pest control, pool and amenity maintenance, and landscaping. Require Seller to continue any renovation or value-add program in progress or, alternatively, to pause and credit the buyer.
- **Data Center:** Particularly critical. Require Seller to maintain all redundancy systems (UPS, generators, CRAC/CRAH units) at current operational levels, continue preventive maintenance per manufacturer specifications, maintain fuel reserves, and continue all vendor contracts for mission-critical infrastructure. Any lapse in maintenance can trigger SLA violations under tenant leases.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **California (Civil Code 1102 et seq.):** Sellers of commercial property have limited statutory disclosure obligations, making contractual covenants the primary protection. Ensure the maintenance covenant is not diluted by the "as-is" clause.
- **New York:** Courts strictly construe interim operating covenants. Use precise language; avoid reliance on implied standards of good faith. The NY Negotiation Checklist emphasizes requiring Seller to "operate and maintain the property until closing; or cause the tenants to operate and maintain their premises."
- **Illinois:** The Pro-Buyer Long Form (IL) (Section 12.01(a)) provides an exceptionally detailed maintenance covenant, including requirements to maintain books and records, continue capital improvement programs, and indemnify buyer for construction-period claims. Use this as the benchmark for aggressive drafting.
- **Texas:** No implied covenant of good faith in commercial contracts. Every obligation must be express.

## Insurance Maintenance

### Preferred Position

Seller must maintain in full force and effect all existing casualty, liability, and other insurance policies covering the Property, with coverage limits and deductibles no less favorable than those in effect as of the Effective Date, with premiums paid through the Closing Date. Seller should be required to provide Buyer with evidence of insurance upon request and to promptly notify Buyer of any cancellation, non-renewal, or material reduction in coverage.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 9.1, and Meadows, Section 6.1):**

> "Between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, Seller shall keep or cause to be kept in full force and effect all insurance policies covering the Property that are in effect as of the Effective Date, including all policies insuring against risks of physical loss or damage, commercial general liability, and such other coverages as are currently maintained, with policy limits and deductibles no less favorable than those in effect as of the Effective Date, with premiums paid through the Closing Date. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any cancellation, non-renewal, or material change in coverage and shall not voluntarily cancel or reduce any such coverage without Buyer's prior written consent."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The covenant should require maintenance of the same policies (not merely "equivalent" coverage), same limits, and same deductibles. A Seller who is winding down operations may seek cheaper coverage with higher deductibles or reduced limits.
- Include a notice obligation for any insurer-initiated cancellation, non-renewal, or coverage change. Many commercial policies can be cancelled by the carrier on 30 days' notice; the buyer needs to know if this occurs.
- Require Seller to name Buyer as an additional insured or loss-payee if requested by Buyer's lender. The UNICO forms do not include this, but it is standard in lender-required PSA provisions.
- Cross-reference the casualty provisions: if insurance is not maintained and a casualty occurs, the buyer's remedy under the casualty section may be hollow.
- The Meadows form (Section 6.1) uses "subject to standard exclusions, with such policy limits as Seller determines is prudent" — this is inadequate. It gives Seller discretion to reduce coverage.
- The PSA - Seller (income property) form (Section 8(c)) provides a clean, short-form covenant: "Seller shall maintain all casualty and liability insurance currently in force with respect to the Property." Acceptable if strengthened with the notice and consent provisions.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller should only be required to maintain insurance that Seller "determines is prudent in the exercise of sound property management practices" (Meadows language). Seller may resist naming Buyer as an additional insured before closing and will object to restrictions on Seller's right to change carriers or adjust coverage.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept "substantially equivalent coverage" language if Seller provides evidence (certificate of insurance) that replacement coverage is no less favorable in all material respects.
2. Accept Seller's discretion on carrier selection, but require minimum A.M. Best rating of A-/VII or equivalent.
3. If Seller resists naming Buyer as additional insured, require Seller to cause the existing property manager to add Buyer as additional insured under the management company's umbrella policy.
4. At minimum, require Seller to maintain the insurance required under the Leases (most commercial leases contain landlord insurance obligations).

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — An uninsured casualty event during the interim period can destroy deal economics. If the property is damaged and Seller has allowed insurance to lapse or reduced coverage below replacement cost, the buyer faces a termination election with lost time and costs, or a closing with impaired property and insufficient insurance proceeds.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office/Retail/Industrial:** Standard property and liability coverages. Confirm business income / rental loss coverage is maintained, as this protects against income loss during any interim-period casualty restoration.
- **Multifamily:** Confirm Seller maintains renter's insurance requirements under leases and that Seller's liability coverage extends to common areas, pools, fitness centers.
- **Data Center:** Require Seller to maintain equipment breakdown / boiler and machinery coverage, which is essential for UPS, generator, and HVAC systems. Standard property insurance may exclude equipment breakdown. Verify business interruption coverage limits are adequate for tenant SLA exposure.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Florida, Texas (coastal):** Wind and flood insurance may be separately placed and extremely expensive. Verify that Seller's covenant covers windstorm and flood policies, which are frequently separate from the main property policy.
- **California (earthquake zones):** Earthquake insurance is typically not carried due to cost. Confirm whether the covenant requires maintaining earthquake coverage (if it existed) or only coverages in place as of the Effective Date.
- **New York:** Confirm Seller maintains terrorism risk insurance (TRIA) if the property is in a high-risk zone.

## Leasing Restrictions — No New Leases Without Consent

### Preferred Position

After the expiration of the due diligence period, Seller should not enter into any new Lease, modify or amend any existing Lease, waive any material Tenant obligation, or terminate any Lease without Buyer's prior written consent, which may be withheld in Buyer's sole and absolute discretion. During the due diligence period, Seller should continue leasing in the ordinary course but must promptly notify Buyer of any leasing activity and provide copies of all proposals, LOIs, and draft leases.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 7.2, strengthened with IL form concepts):**

> "From the Effective Date through the Closing Date, Seller shall not, without Buyer's prior written consent: (a) enter into any new Lease or license agreement affecting any portion of the Property; (b) amend, modify, supplement, renew, extend, or terminate any existing Lease; (c) waive any material right of landlord under any Lease, including any right to collect rent, enforce a default, or exercise a recapture or termination right; (d) accept the surrender of any Lease or any portion of the premises demised thereunder; (e) consent to any assignment or subletting by any Tenant; or (f) grant any concession, abatement, or allowance to any Tenant except as required under the express terms of the Lease. Seller shall promptly deliver to Buyer copies of all correspondence, proposals, LOIs, and draft leases received from or delivered to any Tenant or prospective tenant."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The consent standard is the critical variable. Buyer should seek "sole and absolute discretion" for all leasing activity after expiration of due diligence. Many seller-side forms use "not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed" — this is acceptable as a fallback but limits the buyer's ability to block unfavorable deals.
- Include a deemed-approval mechanism with a reasonable response period. The UNICO forms (both Buyer and Seller sides) provide 5 Business Days for Buyer to respond, with deemed approval if Buyer does not respond. This is market-standard but should be extended to 7-10 Business Days for complex leasing decisions in office and retail contexts.
- Require Seller to provide the full lease package (not just a summary) when seeking consent. The IL Pro-Buyer form requires Seller to provide "a copy of the documents for which approval is sought."
- The Meadows form (Section 6.1) provides that Seller's consent obligation begins only three days after expiration of the Property Approval Period, and permits Seller to act without consent if "contractually obligated" under existing Lease terms. This is reasonable for lease-mandated renewals and options but should not extend to discretionary landlord actions.
- Address leasing costs explicitly: if Buyer approves a new lease or amendment, who bears the TI costs, leasing commissions, and free rent? The UNICO Buyer Side (Section 7.3.3) allocates all "New Leasing Costs" to the Buyer for any new leases approved or deemed approved after the Due Diligence Deadline. This is market-standard; the buyer should accept it but ensure the leasing cost schedule is accurate and updated before closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller must retain the ability to continue leasing vacant space and managing the tenant base, particularly in properties with significant vacancy. Seller will insist on a "not unreasonably withheld" consent standard and a short deemed-approval period (3-5 Business Days). Seller may seek a carve-out for tenant-initiated actions (option exercises, renewal rights) that Seller is contractually obligated to honor.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept "not unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed" as the consent standard, but pair it with a 7-Business-Day response period (10 for retail pad or anchor leases) and a requirement that Seller provide the complete proposed lease (not merely a term sheet).
2. Accept Seller's right to honor tenant-initiated option exercises (renewal options, expansion options, ROFO/ROFR rights) without buyer consent, but require Seller to provide prompt notice and copies of all exercise notices.
3. Accept deemed-approval at 5 Business Days, but require Seller to include a prominent "DEEMED APPROVAL" legend on the consent request and specify that the response period does not begin until Buyer has received the complete proposed lease or amendment.
4. If Seller insists on leasing discretion during the due diligence period, require that (a) Seller provide Buyer with copies of all leasing proposals and executed leases within 2 Business Days, and (b) any lease entered into during due diligence that Buyer finds objectionable may be raised as a diligence objection and serve as a basis for termination.
5. For retail properties with ongoing leasing programs, accept "leasing parameters" — pre-agreed ranges for rent, term, TI, and commissions — within which Seller may lease without case-by-case consent. Leases outside parameters require Buyer's express written consent.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — Unfavorable leases executed between signing and closing directly impair the buyer's investment thesis, underwriting, and lender approval. A below-market lease with above-market TI concessions executed during the interim period cannot be reversed after closing. The buyer is bound by any lease Seller enters into, and lender underwriting may not support the revised cash flow.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Lease terms are longer (5-15 years), TI packages are larger ($40-$100+ per RSF), and leasing decisions have significant long-term economic impact. Buyer should insist on detailed review of any proposed lease, including credit analysis of the prospective tenant.
- **Industrial:** Lease terms are moderate (3-10 years), TI is typically lower. Seller leasing activity is less of a concern, but still require consent for any lease with term exceeding 5 years or TI exceeding $5/SF (adjust for market).
- **Retail:** Highest risk for interim leasing. Co-tenancy clauses, exclusive use restrictions, radius restrictions, and percentage rent provisions in retail leases can dramatically affect other tenants. Require sole discretion consent for any retail lease, particularly anchor or pad site leases.
- **Multifamily:** Residential leases are short-term (typically 12 months) and relatively standardized. Consent requirements may be relaxed to "leasing parameters" (approved rent ranges, standard lease form, maximum concessions). Require consent only for non-standard terms or leases below minimum rent thresholds.
- **Data Center:** Leases involve highly technical specifications (power density, connectivity requirements, SLA terms). Require Buyer's sole discretion consent for any new data center lease or amendment, given the infrastructure and capital implications.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** The NY Negotiation Checklist specifies that the seller must obtain the purchaser's consent before entry into any new lease or amendment or termination of an existing lease. New York courts will enforce this covenant as written; there is no implied reasonableness standard.
- **California:** Under Cal. Civ. Code Section 1951.4, commercial landlords can continue leasing after a tenant abandonment, which may conflict with buyer consent requirements. Ensure the covenant addresses this scenario.
- **Illinois:** The IL Pro-Buyer form (Section 12.01(b)(i)) provides that Seller may not "enter into any new Lease, submit or consider any proposal for a new Lease or terminate any Lease" without Purchaser's approval, "which approval may be given or withheld in its sole and absolute discretion." This is the gold standard for buyer-favorable drafting.

## New Lease Approval Mechanics — Deemed Approval and Leasing Parameters

### Preferred Position

If a deemed-approval mechanism is included (and it typically must be to give Seller comfort that leasing will not stall), the buyer should ensure: (a) the response period is adequate (7-10 Business Days); (b) the period does not begin until Buyer receives a complete lease or amendment package; (c) Buyer's disapproval triggers a requirement for Seller to provide a detailed explanation of the basis for the proposed lease economics; and (d) for large or anchor leases, there is no deemed approval and only express written consent will suffice.

**Preferred structure:**

> "Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of its approval or disapproval (with a detailed explanation of its objections) within [7/10] Business Days of Buyer's receipt of a complete copy of the proposed lease or lease modification, together with all material economic terms, the proposed tenant's financial statements, and any brokerage agreement applicable thereto. If Buyer fails to respond within such period, Buyer shall be deemed to have approved the proposed action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no deemed approval shall apply to any lease involving (i) more than [___] rentable square feet, (ii) a term in excess of [___] years, (iii) tenant improvement costs in excess of $[___] per rentable square foot, or (iv) any Major Tenant."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The UNICO Buyer Side (Section 7.2) provides 5 Business Days for response with deemed approval. This is standard but should be lengthened for complex properties.
- Require Seller to include a conspicuous notice that the request triggers a deemed-approval period. Silent requests buried in routine correspondence should not start the clock.
- Specify what constitutes a "complete" submission: the proposed lease (not a summary), financial statements or credit information for the prospective tenant, the applicable brokerage agreement, a rent comps analysis, and a statement of all leasing costs.
- For retail properties, consider pre-agreed "leasing parameters" that define acceptable rent ranges, maximum TI allowances, maximum free rent periods, prohibited use clauses, and permitted co-tenancy provisions. Leases within parameters may be subject to deemed approval; leases outside parameters require express consent.
- The PSA - Seller (income property) form (Section 8(a)) provides a clean deemed-approval provision: "Buyer's consent shall conclusively be deemed granted if Buyer does not object to a proposed new lease, lease modification or lease termination within five (5) days after Seller has provided Buyer with a written request for approval, together with a copy of the documents for which approval is sought."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The response period should be as short as possible (3-5 Business Days) to avoid losing prospective tenants. Seller will resist any carve-out from deemed approval, arguing it creates uncertainty in the leasing process.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept 5 Business Days but insist on the "complete package" delivery requirement as a condition precedent to the deemed-approval period commencing.
2. Accept that deemed approval applies to all leases (no Major Tenant carve-out), but require Seller to provide at least 2 Business Days' advance notice before sending the formal consent request, so Buyer can prepare for review.
3. For retail leasing parameters, accept narrower parameters than preferred (e.g., rent within 5% of asking, TI within 10% of budget, standard term length) with deemed approval for leases within parameters and express consent for anything outside.
4. If Seller resists the "conspicuous notice" requirement, accept a simpler provision that the consent request must be delivered by email to a designated Buyer representative (not merely sent to the notice address) with a subject line referencing the deemed-approval provision.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Deemed-approval provisions are among the most frequently triggered interim-period mechanisms. An inattentive buyer (or one whose internal approval process takes longer than the response period) can find itself bound by a lease it would not have approved. Ensure the buyer's internal team is alerted to the response deadline immediately upon receipt of any consent request.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office/Industrial:** 5-7 Business Day response period is generally adequate; these leases are relatively standardized and the buyer's team can review quickly.
- **Retail:** Extend to 10 Business Days minimum. Retail leases require careful review of exclusive use provisions, co-tenancy requirements, percentage rent structures, CAM contributions, and tenant mix implications.
- **Multifamily:** Deemed approval is generally acceptable for individual apartment leases within pre-approved parameters. Require express consent only for commercial space within a mixed-use development, or for any lease below a minimum rent threshold.
- **Data Center:** 10 Business Days minimum. Data center leases involve technical review (power requirements, cooling, connectivity, SLA terms) that requires input from engineering teams.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Deemed-approval provisions are generally enforceable in all U.S. jurisdictions as a matter of contract law, but some courts may impose a reasonableness overlay if the overall consent standard is "not to be unreasonably withheld."
- **New York:** Courts are strict about notice requirements; ensure the deemed-approval period is triggered only by proper notice delivered in accordance with the PSA's notice provisions.

## Service Contracts — No New Contracts Without Consent

### Preferred Position

Seller should not enter into any new service contracts, management agreements, brokerage agreements, construction contracts, or similar agreements, or amend or terminate any existing Assumed Contract, without Buyer's prior written consent. Seller should terminate all non-assumed contracts (including the existing property management agreement) at or before Closing at Seller's sole cost.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Buyer Side, Sections 8.2-8.3):**

> "Seller shall not enter into any additional service contracts or other similar agreements or amend any of the Assumed Contracts without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed; provided, however, Seller may enter into such service contracts and other similar agreements only if (a) Seller reasonably determines they are necessary for the continuing operation, maintenance, and repair of the Property, (b) such agreements are cancelable upon not more than 30 days' notice at no cost to Buyer, and (c) all amounts owing thereunder have been or shall be paid by Seller unless they become Assumed Contracts. Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense, terminate on or before Closing all Contracts that are not Assumed Contracts, including the Existing Property Management Agreement."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The buyer should have the right to designate which contracts to assume and which to terminate. The UNICO forms (both Buyer and Seller sides, Section 8.2) provide that Buyer designates assumed contracts on or before the Due Diligence Deadline; failure to designate means Buyer assumes none.
- The emergency / short-term contract exception (Meadows Section 6.1: contracts that are "necessary as a result of an emergency" and "terminable upon not more than thirty (30) calendar days' notice without penalty") is reasonable and market.
- Require Seller to terminate the existing property management agreement at Closing. Both UNICO forms confirm this. The PSA - Seller (income property) form (Section 8(b)) also requires termination of non-assumed contracts.
- The IL Pro-Buyer form (Section 12.01(b)(iii)-(iv)) requires Purchaser's prior written approval for any amendment, modification, termination, or renewal of Assumed Contracts, and for any new Service Contracts — with approval subject to Purchaser's "sole and absolute discretion." This is the most aggressive position.
- Confirm that "Contracts" is broadly defined to include management, leasing, brokerage, maintenance, construction, and all service agreements (UNICO definition, Section 8.1).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller needs flexibility to maintain the property, respond to emergencies, and enter into routine service contracts. Seller will insist on a "commercially reasonable" or "not unreasonably withheld" standard and a meaningful exception for short-term, cancelable contracts.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept "not unreasonably withheld" for routine service contracts, but require sole discretion for management agreements, brokerage agreements, and any contract with a term exceeding 12 months or a value exceeding $50,000 (adjust for deal size).
2. Accept the 30-day cancelable exception for emergency and routine maintenance contracts, but require Seller to notify Buyer within 2 Business Days of entering into any such contract.
3. If Seller resists Buyer's right to designate assumed contracts, require that all contracts are assumed at closing unless Buyer provides written notice of rejection, but cap Buyer's rejection right at the Due Diligence Deadline.
4. Accept that Seller bears termination costs only for contracts that Seller is able to terminate under their express terms. For contracts that cannot be terminated without penalty, allocate the termination fee between Seller and Buyer (or require Buyer to assume if Buyer chose not to exercise its diligence termination right).

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM-HIGH** — Unfavorable service contracts entered during the interim period create ongoing operating costs and may be difficult to terminate after closing. Particular risk areas include long-term management agreements, exclusive leasing agreements, and construction contracts with large remaining balances.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Focus on management agreements, janitorial contracts, elevator maintenance, HVAC service, security, and landscaping. Verify Seller's right to terminate the parking management agreement.
- **Industrial:** Fewer service contracts typically. Focus on roof maintenance, HVAC, and landscaping agreements.
- **Retail:** CAM-related contracts (landscaping, snow removal, security, marketing fund expenditures) are significant. Verify that marketing fund commitments do not exceed budget.
- **Multifamily:** Focus on property management, laundry equipment leases, cable/internet bulk agreements, and amenity management contracts. Laundry equipment leases are frequently long-term and non-cancelable.
- **Data Center:** Critical infrastructure contracts (generator maintenance, UPS service, fire suppression testing, connectivity providers) must be carefully reviewed. These are often sole-source and essential — termination would be operationally disruptive.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Termination of service contracts is governed by the contract terms, not by real estate law. Verify that each contract permits termination upon sale or change of ownership without penalty.
- **New York:** The NY Negotiation Checklist recommends prohibiting Seller from entering into any service agreement that would survive the closing, require any termination payment by the purchaser, or require more than 30 days' notice of termination.

## No Voluntary Encumbrances

### Preferred Position

Seller must not voluntarily place or permit any lien, encumbrance, easement, covenant, restriction, or other title exception to be recorded against the Property after the Effective Date without Buyer's prior written consent. This is a bright-line prohibition with no materiality qualifier.

**Preferred sample language (derived from IL Pro-Buyer form, Section 12.01(b)(v)-(vii), and NY Negotiation Checklist):**

> "From the Effective Date through the Closing Date, Seller shall not, without Buyer's prior written consent (which may be withheld in Buyer's sole and absolute discretion): (a) affirmatively (whether by action or inaction) subject the Property to any additional liens, encumbrances, covenants, conditions, restrictions, or easements; (b) sell, transfer, encumber, or change the status of title of all or any portion of the Property; (c) enter into any agreement that would require the consent of a third party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (d) grant any party any right, option, or first refusal or first offer right with respect to the Property or any portion thereof."

### Key Negotiation Points

- This covenant should be absolute — no "not unreasonably withheld" qualifier. Any new encumbrance impairs the buyer's title and may not be acceptable to Buyer's lender.
- Include both affirmative acts and "inaction" — Seller should not allow a mechanic's lien or judgment lien to attach through failure to pay contractors or creditors.
- The Meadows form does not contain a stand-alone encumbrance restriction — it is subsumed within the general operating covenant. The IL form and NY Checklist are more precise.
- Cross-reference the title provisions: any new exception that appears on the title commitment update should be an objection that Seller is obligated to cure.
- Include "enter into any agreement that would require third-party consent" — this prevents Seller from contracting in ways that create conditions to closing that are outside Buyer's control.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Certain encumbrances may be required in the ordinary course (utility easements for tenant improvements, minor reciprocal easements for access). Seller may also argue that judgment liens are outside Seller's control.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a carve-out for utility easements required by a governmental authority and that do not materially impair the value, use, or operation of the Property, provided Seller gives Buyer advance notice and Buyer does not object within 5 Business Days.
2. Accept that Seller is not liable for involuntary liens (judgment liens, mechanic's liens filed by third parties) provided Seller uses commercially reasonable efforts to discharge them before Closing.
3. If Seller resists "sole and absolute discretion," accept "not to be unreasonably withheld" but add a specific list of prohibited actions that require no consent analysis (e.g., mortgages, deed restrictions, sale of air rights, ground lease subordination).

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — A new encumbrance recorded between signing and closing can impair title insurability, create lender objections, and provide a basis for lien priority disputes. The buyer's lender will typically require clean title with no new exceptions.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office/Retail:** Watch for new reciprocal easement agreements (REAs) or operating agreements that Seller may seek to record in connection with adjacent development.
- **Industrial:** Watch for new utility easements, railroad spur agreements, or environmental use restrictions.
- **Data Center:** Watch for new fiber easements, power line easements, or cooling water rights agreements. These are common in data center operations and may be critical infrastructure, but they must be reviewed before recording.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All states:** Mechanic's lien law varies significantly. In some states (California, Texas), mechanic's liens relate back to the commencement of work and may prime a buyer's interest even if recorded after closing. Require Seller to provide lien waivers from all contractors at closing.
- **New York:** The NY Negotiation Checklist explicitly requires Seller not to "subject the property to any liens, encumbrances, covenants, restrictions, or easements."

## No Material Alterations

### Preferred Position

Seller should not make any material alterations, improvements, or changes to the Property without Buyer's prior written approval. Additionally, Seller should not make any capital improvements or changes except those necessary to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or property damage in emergency situations.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 9.2, and IL Pro-Buyer form, Section 12.01(b)):**

> "Seller shall not make any material alterations to the Property without Buyer's prior written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Seller shall not make any capital improvements or alterations or changes to the Property except those necessary to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or property damage in emergency situations."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Define "material" with a dollar threshold (e.g., any alteration costing more than $25,000 per occurrence or $75,000 in the aggregate). Without a threshold, disputes over materiality are inevitable.
- The IL Pro-Buyer form (Section 12.01(b)) contains an absolute prohibition on capital improvements except for emergencies — this is the most protective position.
- The UNICO Buyer Side (Section 9.2) uses "not unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed" for the consent standard. This is reasonable for a negotiated deal.
- Distinguish between landlord-initiated alterations (which should require consent) and tenant-initiated alterations under existing leases (which Seller may be obligated to permit under lease terms). Require Seller to promptly notify Buyer of any tenant alteration requests.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller may need to make repairs, complete tenant improvements, or address code violations. An absolute prohibition is impractical.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept "not unreasonably withheld" for alterations, but require sole discretion consent for any work exceeding $100,000 or affecting structural elements, building systems, or the building envelope.
2. Accept emergency exception without consent, but require Seller to notify Buyer within 24 hours and provide documentation of the emergency.
3. For ongoing TI work, accept a carve-out for TI obligations under existing leases that are identified on a schedule, provided Seller is performing the work in accordance with the lease terms and approved plans.
4. Accept that Seller may make ordinary-course repairs under $10,000 per occurrence without consent, but require monthly reporting of all such expenditures.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — Unauthorized alterations can create code violations, impair certificate of occupancy status, trigger ADA compliance issues, or change the character of the property in ways that impair the buyer's intended use or tenant mix.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Particular concern with lobby renovations, elevator modernizations, or restroom upgrades that may be partially completed.
- **Industrial:** Watch for dock modifications, clear height changes, or mezzanine installations.
- **Retail:** Watch for pad site construction, parking lot reconfigurations, or anchor space subdivisions.
- **Data Center:** Extreme sensitivity to any alteration affecting power distribution, cooling, or fire suppression systems. Require sole discretion consent for any work affecting critical infrastructure.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Illinois:** The IL Pro-Buyer form (Section 12.01(b)) specifically prohibits capital improvements except emergencies and requires Seller indemnification for construction-period claims. This is the benchmark for aggressive drafting.
- **California:** Building permits are public record and may be required for even modest alterations. Verify whether Seller has pulled any permits for work in progress.

## Tenant Improvement and Capital Expenditure Commitments

### Preferred Position

Buyer should receive a complete schedule of all outstanding landlord obligations under the Leases, including tenant improvement allowances, landlord work obligations, lease buyout payments, and moving allowances ("Existing Leasing Costs"). Seller should bear all Existing Leasing Costs through a closing credit, or complete the work before closing. Any new leasing costs arising from leases approved or deemed approved by Buyer after the Due Diligence Deadline ("New Leasing Costs") should be allocated to Buyer.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 7.3):**

> "Seller represents and warrants that Exhibit L sets forth all Leasing Costs still outstanding under those Leases in effect as of the Effective Date ('Existing Leasing Costs'). No later than 5 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement, with reasonable supporting documentation, of the Existing Leasing Costs actually paid by Seller between the Effective Date and the date of delivery of such statement. At Closing, Buyer shall receive a credit against the Purchase Price in the total amount of the Existing Leasing Costs, less those amounts paid by Seller for Existing Leasing Costs, and Buyer shall assume responsibility for paying the remaining Existing Leasing Costs up to the amount of the credit received at Closing."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Require a detailed schedule of all outstanding TI obligations, free rent commitments, and capital expenditure obligations as an exhibit to the PSA. This schedule should be a Seller representation and warranty.
- The closing credit mechanism (UNICO approach) is cleaner and more protective than requiring Seller to complete the TI work before closing (which creates construction risk and potential delay).
- For in-process TI work, the PSA - Seller (income property) form (Section 9(g)) provides an escrow holdback mechanism: costs are withheld from the Purchase Price and placed in escrow, Buyer completes the work, and excess funds are returned to Seller. This is a practical approach for large projects.
- Require Seller to update the Existing Leasing Costs schedule within 5 Business Days of closing, with documentation of all payments made. The UNICO forms provide for this.
- For New Leasing Costs (leases approved by Buyer after due diligence), both UNICO forms allocate the cost to Buyer. This is market — the buyer approved the lease and should bear the leasing costs.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller should not be required to credit the full amount of outstanding TI obligations at closing, particularly for obligations that are not yet due (e.g., TI for lease renewals with future commencement dates). Seller may seek a split based on a present-value calculation.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a present-value adjustment for TI obligations with commencement dates more than 12 months after closing, using a discount rate equal to the applicable prime rate.
2. Accept an escrow holdback for in-process TI work (rather than a full credit), provided the escrow amount includes a 10-15% contingency above the estimated cost.
3. Accept Seller's completion of TI work before closing for projects that are substantially complete (>75%), provided Buyer has inspection and approval rights over the completed work.
4. For free rent obligations, accept a credit equal to the total remaining free rent (not discounted), as these represent certain future cash flow losses.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Underestimated or undisclosed TI obligations are a frequent source of post-closing disputes. If the Existing Leasing Costs schedule is incomplete, the buyer bears costs it did not underwrite. The exposure can easily exceed $1M on a large multi-tenant property.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** TI obligations are typically the largest exposure — $40-$100+ per RSF for new leases, $15-$40 per RSF for renewals. Verify all outstanding TI obligations, including those triggered by future option exercises.
- **Industrial:** TI obligations are typically modest ($5-$15 per RSF), but build-to-suit or specialized industrial space can have much higher costs. Verify whether any lease requires landlord-funded specialized improvements (clean rooms, freezer/cooler space).
- **Retail:** TI obligations vary widely. Anchor tenants may have received significant landlord contributions. Verify whether any percentage-rent-based TI reimbursements are outstanding.
- **Multifamily:** TI obligations are minimal (unit turnover costs are operating expenses, not TI). Focus on any capital improvement programs in progress (roof, boiler, elevator, common area renovations).
- **Data Center:** TI can be extremely high ($100-$300+ per RSF) for powered shell or turn-key data center space. Verify all outstanding obligations for power and cooling infrastructure.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** TI credits and escrow holdbacks are contractual mechanisms not governed by specific real estate statutes. Ensure the PSA clearly allocates the risk and that the closing credit or escrow mechanism is reflected in the closing statement.

## Delinquent Rent Pursuit

### Preferred Position

Seller should use commercially reasonable efforts to collect all delinquent rents during the interim period. After closing, Buyer should bill tenants for delinquent rents in the ordinary course for a specified period (6 months is market) but should have no obligation to litigate, declare defaults, or hire collection agencies. All post-closing rent collections should be applied first to current amounts owed to Buyer, then to Seller's delinquencies.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 7.5):**

> "Buyer shall have no duty to collect delinquent rents for Seller after Closing but shall be required to bill Tenants for delinquent rents in the ordinary course of business for 6 months after Closing. To the extent Buyer or Seller receives rents on or after the Closing Date, such payments shall be applied (a) first toward the delinquent rent for the actual month in which Closing occurred, (b) second toward the delinquent rent owed to Buyer for its period of ownership, and (c) third toward the delinquent rent owed to Seller for its period of ownership. Seller reserves the right to pursue any remedy for damages against any tenant owing delinquent rents but shall not be entitled to terminate any Lease or any Tenant's right to possession."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The waterfall for applying collected rents is critical: Buyer should insist that current rent owed to Buyer takes priority over Seller's delinquencies. Both UNICO forms use this waterfall. The PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side) (Section 8.4(f)) provides a more granular waterfall that prioritizes the closing month, then the following month (Buyer), then the preceding month (Seller).
- Seller's right to pursue delinquent tenants after closing must be expressly limited: Seller may not terminate any Lease or evict any Tenant (all forms agree on this). The PSA form (Section 8.4(c)) adds that Seller may not "commence or pursue any legal proceedings against any tenant seeking eviction."
- Buyer should not be required to litigate or declare a default under any Lease to facilitate Seller's collection (both UNICO forms provide this).
- Require Seller to deliver its delinquency records before closing and cooperate with Buyer's post-closing collection efforts.
- Buyer should not waive any delinquent rent or modify any Lease to reduce delinquent amounts owed to Seller without Seller's consent (PSA form, Section 8.4(c)).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Buyer should apply all post-closing collections to delinquent rents first (before current rent), since Seller cannot control Buyer's collection efforts. Seller may also seek the right to pursue legal claims directly against delinquent tenants.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept the standard UNICO waterfall (current month first, then Buyer's period, then Seller's period). This is market.
2. Accept Seller's right to pursue claims directly against tenants for pre-closing delinquencies, provided Seller may not seek eviction or lease termination and coordinates with Buyer in advance of any legal action.
3. If Seller insists on a longer billing obligation, accept 9 months (rather than 6) but cap Buyer's obligation at ordinary-course billing — no obligation to retain counsel or collection agencies.
4. Accept a provision requiring Buyer to furnish Seller with periodic reports of rent collections and delinquency status (monthly or quarterly).

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — The financial exposure is typically limited to the amount of pre-closing delinquencies, but the relationship risk is higher: disputes over rent application and collection efforts are a common source of post-closing friction between buyer and seller.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Delinquencies are typically lower for investment-grade tenants. Focus on any tenants that were in payment distress during diligence.
- **Retail:** Higher delinquency risk, particularly in value-add retail with smaller tenants. Percentage rent collections add complexity.
- **Multifamily:** High volume of small-balance delinquencies. The billing obligation can be administratively burdensome. Consider a dollar threshold below which Buyer has no billing obligation.
- **Industrial:** Moderate risk. Single-tenant NNN properties may have minimal delinquency exposure.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Rent application provisions may intersect with commercial rent stabilization laws (if applicable). Verify whether any tenant is protected under ICSA (2019) provisions.
- **California:** Under Cal. Civ. Code Section 1950.5, residential security deposit rules apply to certain mixed-use properties. Ensure the delinquent rent provisions do not conflict with residential tenant protections.

## Cooperation with Buyer's Lender

### Preferred Position

Seller should cooperate, at no cost or expense to Seller, with Buyer's efforts to obtain acquisition financing. Cooperation should include providing financial information, requesting estoppel certificates and SNDAs from tenants, allowing lender consultants to inspect the property, and executing lender-required documents (such as a seller's certification or comfort letter). Buyer's ability to obtain financing should expressly not be a condition to Buyer's obligation to close.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 9.3):**

> "At no cost or expense to Seller, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer's efforts to obtain financing for its acquisition of the Property. Such cooperation shall include requesting financial information, estoppel certificates and/or SNDAs from the Tenants, enforcing such requirements for estoppel certificates and SNDAs to the extent the same may be required under the Leases, and allowing the lender's consultants to inspect the Property subject to the terms of the access provisions above. It is understood and agreed that Buyer's ability to obtain financing for the acquisition of the Property is not a condition to Buyer's obligation to close."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Seller cooperation should be "at no cost or expense to Seller." This is standard and appropriate for an institutional deal. However, if Seller's lender payoff requires a specific form of estoppel or SNDA, Seller should bear those costs as they relate to Seller's existing loan.
- The UNICO forms (both sides) include identical cooperation provisions and expressly state that financing is not a closing condition. This is market for institutional deals.
- Require Seller to enforce estoppel and SNDA requirements under the Leases to the extent available. Many commercial leases require the tenant to deliver an estoppel within a specified period — Seller should be required to exercise that right.
- Allow lender consultants (appraisers, engineers, environmental consultants) access to the property under the same terms as Buyer's due diligence access.
- If Buyer is assuming Seller's existing loan, the cooperation obligations are more extensive: Seller must cooperate with the assumption application, provide lender-required documentation, and pay any assumption fees or prepayment penalties as allocated in the PSA.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller's cooperation obligation should be limited and should not require Seller to incur costs, modify any existing loan documents, or delay closing. Seller will resist any obligation that could be construed as making Seller a guarantor or obligor of Buyer's financing.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept "reasonably cooperate at no cost or expense to Seller" as the standard. This is market.
2. Accept that Seller need not modify existing loan documents, but require Seller to cooperate with Buyer's lender's request for a comfort letter or estoppel from Seller (confirming the terms of the PSA, that Seller is not in default, etc.).
3. Accept that Seller's cooperation does not extend to providing representations or warranties to Buyer's lender, but Seller should agree that Buyer's lender may rely on the title insurance policy and survey.
4. If Buyer is assuming the existing loan, negotiate cooperation obligations in detail, including Seller's obligation to provide historical financial statements, tenant correspondence, and operating histories to the assuming lender.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — Inadequate Seller cooperation can delay or prevent financing, leaving the buyer unable to close. Since financing is not a closing condition in institutional deals, the buyer bears the financing risk — but Seller cooperation is the principal mechanism to mitigate that risk.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The cooperation obligation is substantially the same across asset types. The key variable is the complexity of the SNDA process: retail and office properties with many tenants may require significant SNDA negotiation with individual tenants.
- **Data Center:** Lender due diligence for data center acquisitions is more intensive, requiring detailed infrastructure reports, power capacity analysis, and SLA review. Ensure Seller's cooperation extends to providing engineering documentation and infrastructure testing reports.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** This is a contractual provision not governed by specific state law. Ensure the cooperation obligation is broad enough to cover state-specific lender requirements (e.g., New York mortgage tax affidavits, California documentary transfer tax declarations).

---

## Cooperation with Buyer's Due Diligence

### Preferred Position

Seller should provide Buyer and its consultants with reasonable access to the Property, all books and records, all governmental permits and correspondence, and all tenant files during the due diligence period and continuing through closing. Seller should cooperate with Buyer's inspections, including environmental assessments, property condition assessments, and zoning/code compliance reviews.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Access should be "reasonable" but not limited to business hours. Environmental testing, in particular, may require weekend or evening access.
- Buyer's access to tenant premises should be governed by the applicable Lease terms. The UNICO Buyer Side (Section 3.4.2) provides: "Buyer acknowledges that access to the premises of any tenant under a Lease will be governed by the terms of the applicable Lease."
- Buyer's inspections should not disrupt tenants or interfere with normal property operations (UNICO Section 3.4.2).
- Require Seller to direct its property manager to cooperate with Buyer's consultants and make on-site staff available for interviews and walkthroughs.
- Buyer should carry appropriate insurance during inspections and should indemnify Seller for property damage caused by Buyer's inspections (but not for pre-existing conditions discovered during inspections).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Access should be limited to business hours, with advance notice, and should not include invasive testing (Phase II environmental, destructive testing) without Seller's specific consent. Seller will require Buyer to carry specified insurance coverages during inspections.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept advance notice requirements (24-48 hours) for routine inspections and 5 Business Days for invasive testing.
2. Accept Seller's right to approve Phase II environmental testing and destructive testing, but provide that Seller's approval shall not be unreasonably withheld if Buyer's Phase I identifies recognized environmental conditions.
3. Accept insurance requirements ($1M-$2M CGL, Seller named as additional insured) as a condition to access.
4. Accept that Buyer will restore the Property to its prior condition if invasive testing reveals no issues requiring remediation.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — Inadequate access can result in incomplete due diligence, leaving the buyer with undiscovered conditions. However, this risk is partially mitigated by the due diligence termination right.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office/Retail:** Tenant-occupied spaces may have limited access windows. Coordinate with property management for after-hours access.
- **Industrial:** Focus on environmental access — Phase I and Phase II testing is critical for industrial properties. Require access to loading areas, chemical storage, and underground storage tank areas.
- **Data Center:** Strict security protocols may limit access to server rooms and critical infrastructure areas. Negotiate access with appropriate security escorts and advance notice.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **ASTM E1527-21:** Phase I environmental site assessments are governed by the ASTM standard nationwide. Ensure Seller's cooperation extends to providing all information required under the ASTM standard, including historical use data, environmental permits, and correspondence with regulatory agencies.

---

## Notice of Material Events

### Preferred Position

Seller should be required to promptly notify Buyer of any material event affecting the Property that occurs between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, including: tenant defaults or disputes, litigation or claims, governmental notices, environmental conditions, casualty or condemnation, insurance claims, violations of law, and any event that would make any Seller representation or warranty untrue.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 9.1):**

> "Between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, Seller shall notify or shall cause its property manager to notify Buyer promptly after Seller or its property manager has knowledge of any of the following: (a) notices of default or disputes from any Tenant; (b) notices of disputes involving any Assumed Contract; (c) condemnation, environmental, zoning, or other land-use regulation proceedings specifically relating to the Property; (d) notice of any violations of any laws specifically relating to the Property; (e) any litigation or notice of any claim relating to the Property; and (f) any event or condition that would make any Seller representation or warranty materially untrue or misleading."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The notice obligation should extend to Seller's property manager and agents — not merely to Seller itself. Sellers who use third-party managers may not have direct knowledge of property-level events.
- Specify a notice period: "promptly" is standard, but "within 2 Business Days of knowledge" is more precise.
- Include tenant correspondence: the UNICO Buyer Side (Section 7.2) requires Seller to "immediately deliver to Buyer a copy of any correspondence received from any Tenant regarding any claims of default or requests for action by Seller."
- Require notice of any insurance claim filed between signing and closing.
- The Meadows form (Section 6.1) requires Seller to "promptly give Buyer copies of notices received by Seller asserting any breach or default under the Leases or the Contracts or violation of the Permits."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The notice obligation should be limited to "material" events and should not require Seller to monitor every piece of tenant correspondence or property management communication.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a materiality qualifier for general events, but maintain an absolute notice obligation for: tenant defaults, litigation, governmental violations, environmental conditions, and any event making a Seller representation untrue.
2. Accept "promptly" (rather than a specific day count), but require that notices be delivered by email to expedite delivery.
3. Accept that Seller's obligation is limited to events of which Seller or its property manager has actual knowledge (no duty of inquiry).

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM-HIGH** — Delayed or omitted notice of material events can leave the buyer unable to exercise termination or other remedies before closing. The notice covenant is the buyer's early warning system.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The notice obligation is substantially similar. For data centers, add specific notice requirements for power outages, SLA violations, and infrastructure failures.
- **Retail:** Add notice of any co-tenancy or kick-out right triggered by tenant departures.
- **Multifamily:** Add notice of any building code violations or habitability complaints from governmental agencies.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Notice provisions are contractual and generally enforceable as written. Ensure the PSA's general notice provision (address, method of delivery, deemed-receipt rules) applies to these interim notices.

---

## No Voluntary Zoning Changes

### Preferred Position

Seller should not apply for, consent to, or initiate any change in the zoning, land use classification, or entitlements affecting the Property without Buyer's prior written consent.

**Preferred sample language (derived from IL Pro-Buyer form, Section 12.01(b)(viii), and NY Negotiation Checklist):**

> "Seller shall not, without Buyer's prior written consent (which may be withheld in Buyer's sole and absolute discretion): (a) change or attempt to change, directly or indirectly, the current zoning of the Property; (b) apply for any land use approvals, variances, subdivisions, or lot line amendments; or (c) cancel, amend, or modify any certificate, approval, license, or permit held by Seller with respect to the Property which would be binding upon Buyer after the Closing."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The prohibition should extend to all governmental approvals and permits, not merely zoning. Include building permits, certificates of occupancy, environmental permits, and conditional use permits.
- The IL form (Section 12.01(b)(viii)-(ix)) includes both zoning changes and permit modifications.
- The NY Negotiation Checklist recommends prohibiting Seller from applying for "zoning changes, variances, subdivisions, or lot line amendments."
- Include "directly or indirectly" to prevent Seller from consenting to a third party's zoning application that affects the Property.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller should retain the right to pursue pending governmental applications that were in process before signing, and to respond to governmental inquiries.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a carve-out for applications pending as of the Effective Date, provided they are disclosed on a schedule and Seller keeps Buyer informed of progress.
2. Accept that Seller may respond to governmental inquiries, but may not consent to or support any change without Buyer's prior approval.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — A zoning change during the interim period could fundamentally alter the property's permitted uses, non-conforming status, or development potential. However, zoning changes are relatively rare during a typical closing timeline (30-90 days).

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office/Industrial/Retail:** Focus on maintaining existing zoning entitlements, parking ratios, and signage rights.
- **Data Center:** Zoning for data centers is often narrowly defined and may include conditional use permits with specific conditions. Any change could trigger additional review requirements or operational restrictions.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Zoning changes are governed by local municipal law. The PSA covenant provides contractual protection regardless of the specific municipal zoning procedures.

---

## Employee Matters (Retention, Termination, WARN Act)

### Preferred Position

If the Property has on-site employees (typically employed by the property manager or Seller directly), the PSA should address: (a) whether Buyer is assuming any employees; (b) Seller's obligation to terminate or retain employees through closing; (c) allocation of severance, benefits, and accrued vacation costs; and (d) compliance with the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act and state mini-WARN laws.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Buyer shall have no obligation to hire any of Seller's or Seller's property manager's employees. Seller shall be solely responsible for all wages, salaries, benefits, severance payments, and other compensation owed to Seller's employees and property manager's employees through the Closing Date. Seller shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding the termination of employees, including the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 2101 et seq. ('WARN Act'), and all applicable state and local equivalents. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from and against any claims arising from Seller's employment of or termination of employees, including any claims under the WARN Act."

### Key Negotiation Points

- In most institutional acquisitions, employees are employed by the property management company, not the owner/Seller. Upon closing, the existing management agreement is terminated, and Buyer engages its own property manager. Ensure the PSA clearly states that Buyer is not assuming any employment obligations.
- If the property has Seller-employed staff (common for multifamily and some retail/office properties), determine whether Buyer wishes to hire any existing employees. If so, negotiate a transition mechanism with cooperation from Seller.
- WARN Act compliance: if Seller or the property management company employs 100 or more full-time employees across all sites, the WARN Act may require 60 days' advance notice of a mass layoff or plant closing. Verify whether the property-level headcount triggers WARN obligations.
- Seller should indemnify Buyer against all pre-closing employment claims.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The existing property manager (not Seller) employs the on-site staff, and the management agreement already governs employee matters. Seller will resist an indemnification obligation for third-party management company employees.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept that employee matters are governed by the property management agreement, but require Seller to cause the property manager to cooperate with transition and comply with all applicable employment laws.
2. Accept that Seller's indemnification is limited to employees directly employed by Seller or its affiliates.
3. If Seller cannot provide WARN Act compliance, require a closing credit or escrow holdback sufficient to cover potential WARN Act penalties (60 days of back pay and benefits for each affected employee).

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — WARN Act exposure can be significant for large multifamily or retail properties with substantial on-site staff. Failure to comply with WARN notice requirements can result in liability for up to 60 days of back pay and benefits per affected employee.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily:** Highest employee-count risk. Large apartment communities may have 20-50+ on-site employees (leasing agents, maintenance technicians, porters, concierge). Verify whether employees are Seller's or property manager's.
- **Office/Industrial:** Typically fewer on-site employees. Focus on building engineers, security staff, and porters.
- **Retail (enclosed malls):** Significant staffing for security, housekeeping, maintenance, and management. WARN Act analysis is critical.
- **Data Center:** May have specialized on-site staff (facilities engineers, security). Ensure continuity of critical staff through transition.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **California (Cal-WARN Act):** Applies to employers of 75+ employees (lower threshold than federal WARN). Requires 60 days' notice. Covers relocations of 100+ miles.
- **New York (NY WARN Act):** Applies to employers of 50+ employees (lower threshold). Requires 90 days' notice (longer than federal 60 days).
- **New Jersey:** Employers of 100+ employees, 90 days' notice (the NJ WARN Act has been litigated extensively and imposes substantial penalties).
- **Illinois (IL WARN Act):** Applies to employers of 75+ employees. Requires 60 days' notice.

---

## Tax Protest Continuation

### Preferred Position

Seller should be required to continue all pending real property tax protests and appeals, maintain the current assessed valuation, and not withdraw or settle any pending tax proceeding without Buyer's prior written consent. Any tax refunds should be allocated between Seller and Buyer based on their respective periods of ownership, with credit given to tenants entitled to reimbursement.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Require Seller to disclose all pending tax protests and appeals as of the Effective Date.
- Seller should not settle or withdraw any pending protest without Buyer's consent after the Effective Date.
- Tax refunds should be allocated based on the periods to which the taxes relate (not the date of refund), with appropriate tenant credits.
- If Buyer requests that Seller file a new tax protest for the current assessment period, Seller should cooperate (at Buyer's cost) to file such protest before the applicable filing deadline.
- The PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side) (Section 8.4(d)) provides detailed tax proration mechanics, including provisions for escape assessments and reassessment.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller should retain control of pending tax protests relating to its period of ownership. Seller may argue that continued prosecution of tax protests is costly and should be at Buyer's expense.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept that Seller retains control of protests relating to its period of ownership, but require Seller to keep Buyer informed and not settle without Buyer's consent (since the outcome affects future assessments).
2. Accept that post-closing prosecution of tax protests is at the expense of the party benefiting from the refund.
3. Accept a cooperative approach: Seller and Buyer jointly control the protest for the year in which closing occurs, with costs shared proportionally.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW-MEDIUM** — The financial exposure is limited to the potential tax savings from the protest. However, withdrawal of a protest can result in a higher baseline assessment that persists for years.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Tax protest provisions are substantially similar across asset types. The key variable is the magnitude of the potential assessment reduction, which is larger for higher-value properties.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Real property tax assessment challenges are filed with the Tax Commission (City) or Board of Assessment Review (other counties). Filing deadlines are strict (January for City, May for most other jurisdictions).
- **Texas:** Tax protests must be filed annually with the Appraisal Review Board (typically by May 15 or 30 days after notice, whichever is later). Texas properties are frequently protested, and the buyer should verify whether Seller has filed for the current year.
- **California (Proposition 13):** Reassessment upon change of ownership is mandatory. Tax protest provisions are less relevant because the assessment will reset upon closing. However, verify whether any pending Proposition 8 (temporary decline in value) assessments are in place.
- **Illinois (Cook County):** The triennial reassessment system creates unique considerations. Verify whether the property is in a reassessment year and whether Seller has filed appropriate appeals.

---

## Books and Records Maintenance

### Preferred Position

Seller should be required to maintain all books, records, and financial information relating to the Property in the ordinary course of business through the Closing Date and to make such records available to Buyer at or before Closing. Records should include operating statements, general ledgers, bank statements, tenant correspondence, vendor invoices, and tax returns relating to the Property.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Require Seller to maintain records in sufficient detail for Buyer to perform its post-closing reconciliation of operating expense pass-throughs, tax refunds, and other adjustments.
- Records should be maintained for a minimum period after closing (typically 2-3 years) to facilitate post-closing adjustments and audit.
- Require Seller to cooperate with Buyer's accountants in preparing transfer-year financial statements and tax returns.
- The UNICO Buyer Side (Section 7.7) requires Seller to remain responsible for preparing and delivering annual reconciliation statements for the year preceding closing. This is essential — Buyer cannot prepare these statements without Seller's historical operating data.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller should have no obligation to maintain records after closing beyond what is required by law. Seller may seek to limit document retention to 12 months.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept 24-month retention period (rather than 36) for operational records.
2. Accept that Seller delivers copies (rather than originals) of historical records at closing, with originals available for inspection for 12 months.
3. Accept that Seller's obligation to prepare reconciliation statements is limited to the year immediately preceding closing.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — Inadequate records impair the buyer's ability to perform post-closing reconciliations, verify operating expense pass-throughs, and prepare transfer-year tax returns. The financial exposure depends on the property's tenant base and the complexity of the operating expense reimbursement structure.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office/Retail:** Operating expense pass-through reconciliations are complex and data-intensive. Records retention is critical.
- **Industrial (NNN):** Less complex reconciliation — records retention is less critical.
- **Multifamily:** Rent rolls and unit-level data are important for transition. Less operating expense complexity.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** No state-specific requirements for commercial property records retention between parties. This is purely contractual.

---

## Buyer's Pre-Closing Covenants — Confidentiality

### Preferred Position

Buyer should agree to maintain the confidentiality of all due diligence materials, financial information, and the terms of the transaction, subject to customary carve-outs for disclosures to Buyer's lender, investors, attorneys, accountants, consultants, and as required by law.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Standard confidentiality provisions are market and generally non-controversial.
- Carve-outs should include: (a) Buyer's lender and prospective lenders; (b) Buyer's investors, partners, and prospective investors; (c) Buyer's attorneys, accountants, and consultants; (d) governmental authorities as required by law; (e) any parties to whom disclosure is required in connection with a 1031 exchange.
- Buyer should be responsible for ensuring that its permitted disclosees maintain confidentiality.
- Confidentiality should survive termination of the agreement but should terminate upon closing (when the information becomes Buyer's own).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Confidentiality provisions are generally agreed quickly. The main point of negotiation is the scope of permitted disclosees and whether Seller can restrict Buyer from disclosing the Purchase Price.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Confidentiality breaches rarely result in material damages in commercial real estate transactions, but violations can damage the Seller-Buyer relationship and create tenant concerns.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Substantially similar.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Confidentiality agreements are governed by general contract law. No state-specific considerations.

---

## Buyer's Pre-Closing Covenants — Transition Cooperation

### Preferred Position

Buyer should agree to cooperate with Seller to facilitate a smooth transition, including: (a) coordinating with Seller's property manager on tenant communications; (b) providing information needed for Seller's closing deliveries; (c) cooperating on 1031 exchange requirements; and (d) coordinating on utility transfers and vendor transitions.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The UNICO forms (Section 16.7) include a 1031 exchange cooperation provision: each party agrees to cooperate with the other's exchange, provided the cooperating party incurs no additional liability or expense and the Closing Date is not extended.
- Require mutual cooperation on transition of property management, including introduction of Buyer's management team to on-site staff and tenants.
- Coordinate on the tenant notification letter (to be delivered at or immediately after closing) informing tenants of the ownership change and new rent payment instructions.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

These provisions are generally non-controversial and agreed quickly. The main negotiation is around timing and cost allocation for transition activities.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Failure to cooperate on transition activities can cause operational disruptions but rarely results in material financial harm.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Substantially similar. Data centers and complex office properties may require more detailed transition protocols due to specialized building systems.

### Jurisdictional Notes

## Litigation Cooperation

### Preferred Position

If any litigation or proceeding is pending against the Property or Seller in connection with the Property, Seller should not take any material action in such litigation without Buyer's prior consent (to the extent such action would bind the Property or Buyer after closing). Seller should indemnify Buyer against all losses arising from pre-closing litigation.

**Preferred sample language (derived from IL Pro-Buyer form, Section 12.01(b)(x)):**

> "Seller shall not take any action in respect of any litigation or proceeding in respect of the Property which shall have a material adverse effect on the Property; provided, however, nothing shall preclude Seller from filing appropriate pleadings prior to the answer date or pursuant to an order of the court. In the event Seller shall take any action in respect of any litigation or proceeding in respect of the Property, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from and against any and all loss, liabilities, costs, damages, expenses, assessments, and penalties incurred by Buyer as a result of any such litigation or proceeding. The foregoing indemnity shall survive the Closing without any restriction or limitation."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Exclude personal injury cases from the consent requirement (Seller needs to defend these without delay).
- Require Seller to promptly notify Buyer of any new litigation or claims filed against the Property.
- The indemnity for pre-closing litigation should survive closing without time limitation. The IL form provides this explicitly.
- Require Seller to not settle any claim that would create an encumbrance on the Property or obligate the Property or Buyer in any way.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller should retain full control of pre-closing litigation. Seller will resist an uncapped, unlimited-duration indemnification.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept that Seller retains control of pre-closing litigation, but require Seller not to settle any claim that creates an encumbrance on the Property without Buyer's consent.
2. Accept a survival limitation on the litigation indemnity (e.g., 24 months post-closing).
3. Accept an aggregate cap on the indemnity tied to the PSA's general indemnity cap or survival limitations.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — Pre-closing litigation can result in liens, injunctions, or judgments that impair the Property or Buyer's title. The indemnification obligation is the buyer's primary protection.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Substantially similar. Retail and multifamily properties may have higher exposure to slip-and-fall and habitability claims.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Litigation indemnification provisions are governed by general contract law. Verify that the indemnification scope includes attorneys' fees, which may not be recoverable in all jurisdictions absent an express contractual provision.

## Updated Rent Roll and Closing Deliveries

### Preferred Position

Seller should deliver updated rent rolls no sooner than 10 Business Days and no later than 5 Business Days before closing. The updated rent roll should be in substantially the same form as the rent rolls provided during due diligence, enabling Buyer to compare and identify any changes.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Buyer Side, Section 7.6):**

> "No sooner than 10 Business Days prior to Closing and no later than 5 Business Days prior to Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer updated rent roll(s) for the Property substantially in the same form as the rent roll(s) provided as part of the Due Diligence Materials."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The timing window (10-5 Business Days before closing) ensures the information is current without creating a last-minute delivery.
- The rent roll should include: tenant name, suite number, lease commencement and expiration dates, current base rent, security deposit, prepaid rent, free rent periods, outstanding TI obligations, and rent delinquency status.
- Compare the updated rent roll to the diligence rent roll; any material adverse change (tenant vacating, new delinquency, early termination notice) should be a closing condition failure or give Buyer a termination right.
- Both UNICO forms (Buyer and Seller sides) include this provision at Section 7.6.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

These provisions are generally non-controversial. The main negotiation is whether a material adverse change in the rent roll gives Buyer a termination right or merely a credit.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — The updated rent roll is the buyer's final check on the income stream it is acquiring. A failure to deliver, or a rent roll that conceals adverse changes, can result in significant post-closing losses.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Substantially similar. Multifamily properties with hundreds of units should deliver a summary rent roll plus electronic data for individual unit analysis.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** No state-specific considerations.
