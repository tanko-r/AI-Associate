# Representations and Warranties -- Buyer Side Playbook

This playbook addresses the negotiation of representations and warranties in a purchase and sale agreement for institutional commercial real estate acquisitions ($50M+), from the buyer's perspective. The buyer's overarching objective is to maximize the scope, duration, and enforceability of seller representations while minimizing the scope of buyer's own representations and the effect of knowledge-based qualifiers and liability limitations.

## PART ONE: SELLER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

---

## 1. Organization and Authority

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that it is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of its state of formation and in the state where the Property is located. The execution, delivery, and performance of the Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary action. The Agreement constitutes a legal, valid, and binding obligation of Seller enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject only to bankruptcy, insolvency, and equitable principles). All persons executing on behalf of Seller are duly authorized. No further consents, approvals, or authorizations are required from any person or entity.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Require Seller to represent good standing in both its jurisdiction of formation AND any jurisdiction where the Property is located or where Seller does business. This matters because a Seller not qualified to do business in the Property's state may lack standing to convey, or may trigger tax withholding issues.
- If Seller is an SPE or fund vehicle, insist on representations that the organizational documents have been provided, that no dissolution proceedings are pending, and that Seller will not dissolve before the survival period expires.
- Require that the enforceability qualifier ("subject to bankruptcy, insolvency...") NOT include a general qualifier that carves out "any other similar laws affecting creditors' rights" -- limit it to the standard formulation.
- If Seller is a trust, require representation that the trust has not been revoked and the trustee has authority to sell.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller may argue that it is selling through an SPE that was recently formed and cannot represent a long history of good standing.
- **Fallback**: Accept the representation as of the Effective Date only, but require that Seller deliver at Closing evidence of authority (certificate of good standing, organizational documents, resolution authorizing the sale) as a closing deliverable. Add a covenant that Seller will maintain its existence and good standing through the end of the survival period.
- **Pushback**: Seller insists that internal approvals (e.g., from an investment committee or joint venture partner) are still pending.
- **Fallback**: This is a significant red flag. If Seller cannot make the authority representation, buyer should require that the approval be obtained within the due diligence period and add a termination right if it is not. Never waive this representation entirely.

### Risk Assessment
Failure of the authority representation renders the entire transaction voidable. This is a non-negotiable, foundational representation. Title insurance will typically not insure against defects arising from lack of seller authority unless the title company has received satisfactory evidence of authorization.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily**: Seller may be a real estate fund with multiple layers of entities. Require organizational charts and representations at each level of the ownership chain.
- **Data Centers**: Seller entities may be subsidiaries of REITs or private equity sponsors; ensure that any REIT-level restrictions on disposition do not impair Seller's authority.
- **Joint Ventures**: If Seller is a JV entity, require that all JV partners have approved the sale and that the JV agreement does not contain buy-sell provisions or ROFR rights that would interfere.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Delaware LLCs**: The operating agreement governs authority; there is no concept of "resolutions" as with corporations. Insist on a certification from the authorized person or managing member.
- **New York**: Seller must comply with LLC or LP publication requirements (NY LLC Law Section 206). Failure to publish does not dissolve the entity but may affect its ability to maintain actions in NY courts.
- **California**: Foreign LLCs must register with the Secretary of State; failure to do so may result in penalties and an inability to maintain actions in California courts.

## 2. No Conflicts

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that the execution, delivery, and performance of the Agreement, and consummation of the transactions contemplated, will not: (a) violate any law, judgment, order, injunction, decree, regulation, or ruling applicable to Seller; (b) conflict with or result in a breach of Seller's organizational documents; (c) constitute a default under any note, mortgage, deed of trust, indenture, or any lease or other material agreement to which Seller is a party; or (d) result in the creation of any lien, charge, or encumbrance on the Property.

### Key Negotiation Points
- The clause should be absolute -- no knowledge qualifier. Seller is in the best position to know whether the transaction creates a conflict.
- Resist any narrowing to "material" conflicts. Any conflict could delay or prevent closing.
- Require the representation to cover not only Seller's organizational documents but also any joint venture agreements, financing documents, ground leases, REA agreements, or CC&Rs affecting the Property.
- If there is an existing loan, require that the sale does not constitute a default under the loan documents (particularly due-on-sale/due-on-encumbrance clauses), OR that Seller has obtained the lender's consent.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues it cannot represent as to matters it does not control, such as third-party consents.
- **Fallback**: Accept a modification for third-party consents that reads "except for consents that have been or will be obtained prior to Closing," but only if obtaining those consents is made a condition to Buyer's obligation to close.
- **Pushback**: Seller has an existing loan with a due-on-sale clause and does not know whether the lender will consent.
- **Fallback**: If the existing loan is being assumed, carve it out of the no-conflicts rep but make lender approval a separate closing condition with a defined outside date. If the loan is being paid off, Seller should represent that it will cause the loan to be paid off at or prior to Closing.

### Risk Assessment
A conflict with existing loan documents is the most common practical risk. Buyer should verify independently through title and UCC searches that there are no undisclosed security interests or liens that could be triggered by the sale.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Retail**: Ground lease structures are common. Verify that the ground lease does not contain restrictions on transfers or change-of-control provisions that could be triggered.
- **Industrial**: Long-term net leases may contain ROFR or co-tenancy provisions that the sale could trigger.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- In all jurisdictions, a transfer in violation of a loan covenant is generally not void but may trigger acceleration of the loan, which creates a lien priority problem and title insurance issue.

---

## 3. No Litigation

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that: (a) Seller is not a party to, and has not received written notice of, any action, litigation, suit, arbitration, unsatisfied order or judgment, governmental investigation, or pending or threatened proceeding that would (i) affect Seller's ability to perform its obligations under the Agreement, or (ii) affect the Property or the use, operation, or value thereof; and (b) to Seller's knowledge, no such matter has been threatened.

### Key Negotiation Points
- The "written notice" qualifier on threatened litigation is acceptable for the affirmative portion, but insist on a "to Seller's knowledge" standard (not limited to "written notice") for threatened matters. Sellers often receive oral communications about potential claims before formal notice.
- Require disclosure of ALL litigation affecting the Property, not just litigation that would be "material" or that would "materially and adversely affect" the Property. A $50,000 ADA lawsuit is not material to a $100M deal, but a pattern of such lawsuits may indicate systemic non-compliance.
- **Fallback negotiation chain**: (1) No materiality qualifier at all; (2) if seller insists, agree to a defined dollar threshold (e.g., claims exceeding $50,000 individually or $150,000 in the aggregate); (3) last fallback: accept "material adverse effect" but define it precisely.
- Require separate disclosure of any pending or threatened condemnation proceedings (discussed below), tax certiorari proceedings, zoning or code enforcement actions, and labor/employment disputes.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues that routine slip-and-fall claims should be excluded because they are covered by insurance and are a normal cost of property ownership.
- **Fallback**: Accept a carve-out for matters being defended by Seller's insurance carriers with an aggregate value below a stated threshold, but only if the representation confirms that insurance coverage is in place, the insurer has accepted defense, and no reservation of rights letter has been issued.
- **Pushback**: Seller uses the formulation from the UNICO Seller Side form: "Seller is not a party to any action...that would affect Seller's ability to execute, deliver and perform all of its obligations under this Agreement." This is far too narrow -- it excludes litigation affecting the Property itself.
- **Fallback**: Reject this formulation entirely. Insist on coverage of both (a) ability to perform and (b) matters affecting the Property. The UNICO Buyer Side form correctly includes both prongs.

### Risk Assessment
Undisclosed litigation is one of the most common sources of post-closing claims. Environmental contamination lawsuits, tenant disputes, construction defect claims, and personal injury actions can each materially impair property value. The survival period for this representation should be at the longer end of the negotiated range.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily**: Fair housing claims, habitability complaints, and code enforcement actions are particularly common. Require specific disclosure of any fair housing complaints filed with HUD or state equivalents.
- **Retail**: Slip-and-fall litigation volume can be significant. Consider a carve-out only for insured personal injury claims below a stated threshold.
- **Office**: ADA accessibility claims are increasingly common, particularly for older buildings. Require disclosure of any pending ADA actions and any demand letters received in the prior 24 months.
- **Data Centers**: Intellectual property claims, utility disputes, and easement litigation are more relevant than personal injury claims.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **California**: Proposition 65 (Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act) requires disclosure of chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive harm. Pending Prop 65 claims should be specifically addressed.
- **New York**: Rent stabilization and rent control disputes are a separate category of litigation risk for multifamily properties.
- **Illinois**: The Illinois Environmental Protection Act permits citizen suits; require disclosure of any IEPA notices or citizen suit threats.

---

## 4. Compliance with Laws / No Violations

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that: (a) Seller has not received any written notification from any insurance company, governmental authority, or public agency that the Property is in violation of any applicable fire, health, building, use, occupancy, or zoning laws, ordinances, or regulations that has not been cured; and (b) to Seller's knowledge, the Property complies in all material respects with all applicable laws, codes, ordinances, rules, and regulations.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Distinguish between (a) Seller's receipt of violation notices (which should be a flat representation, not knowledge-qualified) and (b) actual compliance with laws (which may reasonably be knowledge-qualified because full compliance is difficult to verify without expensive testing and inspection).
- Push for the representation to cover not only current violations but also any work orders, corrective notices, or remediation requirements that remain outstanding.
- Require that Seller deliver copies of all violation notices and compliance orders received in the prior 36 months, regardless of whether they have been cured.
- Add a covenant that Seller will promptly notify Buyer of any new violation notices received between the Effective Date and Closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues it cannot represent compliance with all laws, only that it has not received violation notices.
- **Fallback**: Accept the "no violation notices" formulation for the flat representation, but add a knowledge-qualified representation that Seller is not aware of any material non-compliance. The UNICO forms use this two-tiered approach effectively.
- **Pushback**: Seller wants to limit the representation to current violations and exclude historical violations that have been cured.
- **Fallback**: Accept "which violation has not been cured" but require disclosure of all violations received in the prior 24-36 months, cured or not, because the pattern of violations may reveal systemic issues.

### Risk Assessment
Code violations, particularly fire safety and ADA violations, can result in remediation costs disproportionate to the purchase price. A building-wide fire alarm or sprinkler system upgrade can cost millions. Buyer should independently verify compliance through Phase I ESA, property condition assessments, and zoning compliance reports during due diligence.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office/Retail**: ADA compliance, fire code compliance, and local building code compliance are primary concerns. Older buildings may have grandfathered non-conforming conditions.
- **Industrial**: Environmental compliance (air quality permits, stormwater permits, hazardous waste storage permits) is paramount.
- **Multifamily**: Habitability codes, lead paint regulations (for pre-1978 buildings), and local housing code compliance are critical.
- **Data Centers**: Electrical code compliance, fire suppression (especially Halon alternatives), and generator permit compliance are specialized concerns.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York City**: The Local Law 11 facade inspection program, Local Law 87 energy audit/retro-commissioning requirements, and Local Law 97 building emissions limits create compliance obligations unique to NYC.
- **California**: Title 24 energy efficiency standards, seismic retrofit requirements (especially in Los Angeles and San Francisco), and Cal/OSHA requirements add layers of compliance.
- **Chicago**: The Chicago Building Code has unique requirements for high-rise buildings, including life safety evaluations and the requirement to file periodic inspection reports.

## 5. Environmental Matters

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that: (a) Seller has not received any written notice from any governmental entity, neighboring property owner, or any other person regarding the existence of any Hazardous Materials on, under, or migrating to or from the Property in violation of any Environmental Law, or regarding any current or threatened violation of any Environmental Law; (b) to Seller's knowledge, no Hazardous Materials exist on, under, or have been released from the Property in violation of Environmental Law; (c) no underground storage tanks (USTs) are located on or under the Property; (d) to Seller's knowledge, no asbestos-containing materials (ACM), lead-based paint (LBP), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), or mold conditions exist on the Property except as disclosed in the environmental reports delivered to Buyer; (e) Seller has not generated, stored, treated, transported, or disposed of any Hazardous Materials on the Property except in compliance with Environmental Laws; and (f) no environmental liens or deed restrictions have been recorded against the Property.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Breadth of Hazardous Materials definition**: Ensure the definition covers petroleum and petroleum by-products, radon, asbestos and ACM, PCBs and PCB-containing equipment, radioactive elements, infectious agents, urea formaldehyde, and PFAS/PFOS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances). The UNICO forms include a good base definition but omit PFAS, which is the most rapidly evolving area of environmental regulation.
- **Exclusion for ordinary-course substances**: Both the UNICO Buyer Side and Seller Side forms exclude "solvents, cleaning fluids and other lawful substances used in the ordinary operation and maintenance of the Property." This is acceptable but must be carefully limited to quantities and uses compliant with law.
- **Notice vs. knowledge vs. flat representation**: The no-notice prong should be a flat representation. The actual-condition prong (presence of contamination) should be at minimum knowledge-qualified, but push for a flat representation with a schedule of known environmental conditions. Seller will resist a flat representation because environmental conditions may exist that neither party is aware of.
- **Underground storage tanks**: Push for a flat representation that no USTs are present, or if USTs exist, that they are properly registered, permitted, and in compliance with all applicable regulations, including leak detection and financial assurance requirements.
- **PFAS**: Emerging PFAS regulations (EPA Maximum Contaminant Levels under the Safe Drinking Water Act, state-level action levels) create new exposure. Add a specific representation regarding PFAS contamination if the property uses or has historically used firefighting foam (AFFF), is near an airport or military installation, or is an industrial property.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues that the Phase I ESA provided to Buyer is the entire basis for environmental representations, and Buyer should rely on its own environmental due diligence.
- **Fallback**: Accept that certain environmental representations are limited to Seller's knowledge, but insist that: (1) the knowledge qualifier includes a duty to inquire (or at minimum, that the knowledge individuals have actually reviewed the Phase I and Phase II reports); (2) Seller must disclose all environmental reports in its possession, including any reports prepared for prior owners that Seller has obtained; and (3) the environmental representation survives closing for a longer period than other representations (e.g., 18-24 months vs. 12 months for general reps).
- **Pushback**: Seller insists on limiting environmental representations to notices received, with no knowledge qualifier regarding actual conditions.
- **Fallback**: Accept the notice-only formulation but: (1) expand the notice prong to include communications from neighboring property owners, tenants, and contractors (not just governmental entities); (2) require Seller to deliver all environmental correspondence received in the prior 5 years; and (3) insist on an indemnity for pre-existing contamination that is separate from (and survives longer than) the general rep survival period.

### Risk Assessment
Environmental contamination is the single largest uncapped liability risk in CRE acquisitions. CERCLA imposes strict, joint-and-several, retroactive liability on current owners. The "innocent purchaser" defense under CERCLA requires the buyer to have conducted "all appropriate inquiries" (AAI) prior to acquisition. Environmental representations complement, but do not substitute for, thorough Phase I and Phase II environmental site assessments.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: The highest-risk asset class for environmental contamination. Require expanded representations covering historical use, prior operators, spill reports, compliance history, air emissions permits, and stormwater discharge permits.
- **Retail**: Gas station pads, dry cleaners, and auto service tenants create environmental exposure. Require specific representations regarding tenant environmental compliance and any known tenant-caused contamination.
- **Office**: Lower environmental risk, but potential concerns include ACM in older buildings, PCBs in transformers and light ballasts, and indoor air quality (mold, Legionella in cooling towers).
- **Multifamily**: Lead-based paint disclosure is required by federal law (42 USC Section 4852d) for pre-1978 housing. Require specific representations regarding LBP inspections, abatement history, and tenant notifications.
- **Data Centers**: Diesel fuel storage for backup generators, battery acid from UPS systems, and transformer oil (potentially PCB-containing) are the primary environmental concerns.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New Jersey**: The Industrial Site Recovery Act (ISRA) and the Site Remediation Reform Act (SRRA) may require environmental investigation and remediation as a condition of transfer. This is a deal-critical compliance item.
- **Connecticut**: The Connecticut Transfer Act (CT General Statutes Section 22a-134) imposes similar transfer-triggered investigation requirements for "establishments" (properties with certain industrial or commercial uses).
- **California**: Proposition 65 disclosure requirements; Cal/EPA regulatory framework overlays federal CERCLA; California DTSC oversight.
- **New York**: The Brownfield Cleanup Program (BCP) may affect liability and remediation obligations; NYC E-Designation program imposes environmental restrictions on certain properties.
- **Illinois**: The Illinois Environmental Protection Act; potential liability under the Illinois Responsible Property Transfer Act (IRPTA), which requires disclosure of environmental conditions at closing.

---

## 6. Leases

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that: (a) Exhibit J (the Lease Schedule) is a true, correct, and complete list of all leases, licenses, and other occupancy agreements affecting the Property; (b) copies of all Leases (including all amendments, addenda, side letters, and guarantees) delivered to Buyer are true, correct, and complete; (c) the Leases have not been modified except as set forth on the schedule; (d) all Leases are in full force and effect; (e) there are no uncured landlord defaults under the Leases; (f) to Seller's knowledge, there are no uncured tenant defaults under the Leases; (g) the rent roll delivered to Buyer is true, correct, and complete in all material respects as of its date; (h) no tenant has paid rent more than one month in advance; (i) no tenant is entitled to any rent concession, free rent, abatement, or offset except as disclosed on the schedule; (j) all security deposits are as set forth on the schedule, and no security deposits have been applied; (k) all tenant improvement obligations of the landlord have been completed and fully paid for except as disclosed on the schedule; (l) no tenant has any option to purchase the Property or right of first refusal or right of first offer to purchase; (m) no tenant has any expansion or relocation rights except as set forth in the Lease; (n) Seller has not received any notice of any tenant's intention to vacate, terminate, or not renew its Lease; (o) there are no brokerage commissions or leasing fees due or to become due with respect to any existing Lease term except as disclosed.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Completeness of lease schedule**: This is critical. Require a representation that the schedule includes not only formal leases but also any side letters, work letter agreements, commission agreements, SNDAs, estoppel certificates, amendments, and guarantees. Oral modifications should be represented as non-existent.
- **Landlord defaults vs. tenant defaults**: Landlord defaults should be a flat representation (no knowledge qualifier) because Seller controls its own performance. Tenant defaults may reasonably be knowledge-qualified because Seller may not be aware of every tenant default.
- **Rent roll accuracy**: The UNICO Buyer Side form correctly requires that rent rolls "are true, correct and complete in all material respects as of the date thereof." Push for updated rent rolls to be delivered within 5-10 business days before Closing with a representation that they remain true and correct.
- **TI obligations**: Unfunded tenant improvement obligations represent a significant unfunded liability. Require a schedule of all outstanding TI obligations with dollar amounts and completion deadlines.
- **Options to purchase**: A tenant option to purchase the Property can derail the entire transaction. Require a flat representation (no knowledge qualifier) that no such options exist, and independently verify through lease review.
- **Lease commissions**: Unfunded leasing commissions can be a significant hidden liability. The UNICO Buyer Side form correctly requires disclosure of all Commission Agreements and represents that all commissions have been paid in full except as disclosed.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues it should only represent "to Seller's knowledge" regarding lease matters because the property manager handles day-to-day operations.
- **Fallback**: Reject a blanket knowledge qualifier on lease representations. The compromise is: flat representations for matters entirely within Seller's control (completeness of lease schedule, landlord defaults, TI obligations, commissions due), and knowledge-qualified representations only for tenant-side matters (tenant defaults, tenant financial condition, tenant intention to vacate). Require that the knowledge individuals include the property manager or asset manager with direct operational responsibility.
- **Pushback**: Seller resists representing that rent rolls are "true, correct and complete" and offers only "substantially accurate."
- **Fallback**: Accept "true and correct in all material respects" but define materiality with a specific dollar threshold (e.g., variances exceeding $10,000 per tenant or $50,000 in the aggregate).

### Risk Assessment
Lease representation breaches are the most frequently litigated post-closing claims in CRE transactions. The gap between the represented lease economics and reality directly impacts property value and the buyer's ability to obtain or maintain financing. Estoppel certificates from tenants provide a critical cross-check against Seller's representations but do not eliminate the need for robust landlord-side representations.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office**: Focus on free rent burn-off schedules, TI obligations, expansion and contraction options, and co-tenancy provisions.
- **Retail**: Require representations regarding percentage rent provisions, radius restrictions, exclusive use clauses, co-tenancy clauses, and go-dark provisions. These provisions can dramatically affect value.
- **Industrial**: Focus on permitted use provisions (especially for hazardous materials users), TI obligations (typically lower), and renewal options at below-market rates.
- **Multifamily**: Hundreds of residential leases make individual lease review impractical. Require representations that all leases are on the standard form attached as an exhibit, with disclosed deviations only. Also address rent-regulated units separately.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York City**: Rent stabilization and rent control add complexity. Require separate representations regarding the number and identity of rent-regulated units, the current legal regulated rents, and compliance with the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA).
- **California**: Require representations regarding compliance with the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB 1482), which imposes statewide rent caps and just-cause eviction protections.
- **Oregon**: Oregon's statewide rent control law (SB 608) limits annual rent increases. Require a representation regarding compliance.

---

## 7. Contracts

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that: (a) Exhibit D is a true, correct, and complete list of all contracts, service agreements, management agreements, and other agreements affecting the Property; (b) copies delivered to Buyer are true, correct, and complete; (c) there are no uncured defaults by Seller or, to Seller's knowledge, by any counterparty under the Contracts; and (d) no contracts or agreements affecting the Property will be binding on Buyer after Closing other than the Leases, Permitted Exceptions, and Assumed Contracts.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Require the representation to cover ALL agreements affecting the Property, including management agreements, brokerage agreements, construction contracts, equipment leases, utility agreements, access agreements, and any master service agreements.
- Push for an affirmative right to designate which contracts Buyer will assume (Assumed Contracts) and require Seller to terminate all others at or before Closing at Seller's expense.
- Require Seller to represent that no contracts contain change-of-control provisions, anti-assignment clauses, or terms that would be triggered by the sale.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues that certain contracts (e.g., elevator maintenance, fire alarm monitoring) cannot be terminated without penalty.
- **Fallback**: Accept that contracts with early termination penalties will be disclosed on a schedule, and Seller will either (a) pay the termination penalties at Closing, or (b) the contracts will become Assumed Contracts with a Closing credit to Buyer for above-market terms. Buyer should not inherit below-market lockups without compensation.

### Risk Assessment
Service contract obligations are typically modest in isolation but can aggregate into significant liabilities. Long-term contracts at above-market rates (e.g., laundry services in multifamily, HVAC maintenance) reduce NOI and therefore property value.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily**: Property management agreements, laundry service contracts, cable/internet provider contracts (bulk agreements), and amenity management contracts are common.
- **Data Centers**: Power purchase agreements (PPAs), fiber connectivity agreements, and managed services contracts may represent critical, high-value obligations.
- **Office**: Parking management agreements, food service contracts, and conference center operation agreements.
- **Retail**: Common area maintenance (CAM) agreements, marketing fund administrators, and merchant association agreements.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Some jurisdictions impose statutory notice requirements for assignment of certain contracts (e.g., insurance policies, utility contracts). Buyer should verify assignment mechanics during due diligence.

---

## 8. Condemnation

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that: (a) no condemnation, eminent domain, or similar proceedings are pending against the Property or any portion thereof (including access to public streets and utilities); and (b) to Seller's knowledge, no such proceedings have been threatened.

### Key Negotiation Points
- The "pending" prong should be a flat representation. The "threatened" prong may be knowledge-qualified.
- Extend the representation to cover not only formal condemnation proceedings but also any communications from governmental authorities regarding road widening, utility easement acquisitions, redevelopment plans, or any other governmental action that could result in a partial or total taking.
- Pair this representation with a covenant requiring Seller to promptly notify Buyer of any condemnation proceedings or threats arising between the Effective Date and Closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
Minimal pushback is typical on this representation. If Seller qualifies the entire representation with knowledge, push back firmly -- pending condemnation is a matter of public record and Seller should represent it flatly.

### Risk Assessment
Even a partial taking (e.g., for road widening) can impair parking ratios, access, or building setbacks, all of which affect value and compliance with lease requirements and zoning.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Retail**: Loss of parking or access from a partial taking can trigger lease termination rights or violate parking requirements.
- **Industrial**: Partial takings affecting truck courts or loading docks can render a property functionally obsolete for its intended use.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: The Eminent Domain Procedure Law (EDPL) governs the condemnation process. Buyer should check for any pending EDPL proceedings.
- **California**: The public entity must engage in good-faith negotiations before commencing eminent domain. Pre-litigation communications may not be publicly recorded.

---

## 9. Tax Appeals

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that: (a) there are no pending tax certiorari proceedings or tax appeals affecting the Property, except as disclosed on a schedule; and (b) Seller has not filed for any reduction in the assessed value of the Property that has not been resolved. All pending proceedings are disclosed with docket numbers, assessed values in dispute, and estimated refunds.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Require disclosure of ALL pending tax appeals, including the tax years in dispute, the current assessment, the requested reduction, and any tax overpayment reserves or escrows.
- Address the allocation of tax refunds: refunds attributable to periods before Closing belong to Seller (subject to tenant pass-through obligations); refunds for periods on or after Closing belong to Buyer.
- Require Seller to cooperate with Buyer in continuing or settling any pending tax appeals post-Closing, and provide that Buyer will have approval rights over any settlement of pending appeals that could affect future assessed values.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller wants unfettered right to settle pending tax appeals before Closing.
- **Fallback**: Accept Seller's right to settle but require that (a) Buyer receive notice and a copy of any proposed settlement, (b) Buyer consent to any settlement that would result in an assessed value higher than the currently appealed amount (because this affects Buyer's future tax burden), and (c) Seller reimburse any tenant overcharges resulting from the settlement.

### Risk Assessment
Tax appeals interact with lease economics. In triple-net and modified gross leases, tax reductions benefit tenants through reduced pass-through charges. A pending appeal that settles favorably post-Closing may primarily benefit tenants rather than Buyer, depending on lease terms.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **All asset types**: Tax appeals are ubiquitous. The critical variation is the extent to which tenants bear or benefit from tax adjustments under their lease structures.
- **Multifamily**: In states with rent regulation, tax benefits may be subject to pass-through limitations (e.g., NYC DHCR rules on major capital improvements and tax benefit pass-throughs).

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: Tax certiorari proceedings under RPTL Article 7 are extremely common. Proceedings may be pending for multiple tax years simultaneously.
- **California**: Proposition 13 limits reassessment except upon change of ownership. A transfer will trigger reassessment to market value, which is a known cost. Pending appeals of pre-transfer assessments should still be disclosed.
- **Texas**: Property tax valuations are aggressive, and protests are filed annually for virtually every institutional property. Require disclosure of protest history and any pending Administrative Law Judge or district court proceedings.

---

## 10. FIRPTA / Tax Withholding

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that Seller is not a "foreign person" as defined in Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Seller agrees to deliver at Closing a non-foreign person affidavit (FIRPTA certificate) in the form required by the Code and Treasury Regulations.

### Key Negotiation Points
- This is essentially non-negotiable. If Seller IS a foreign person, the buyer must withhold 15% of the amount realized (the gross purchase price) under FIRPTA and remit it to the IRS on Form 8288. The only alternatives are for Seller to obtain a withholding certificate from the IRS (Form 8288-B) reducing the withholding amount, or for Buyer to obtain the property through a domestically controlled REIT.
- If Seller is a "disregarded entity" for tax purposes, the FIRPTA certificate must be delivered by the entity's regarded owner.
- If Seller is a partnership, obtain confirmation of whether any partners are foreign persons, as this may affect state-level withholding requirements even if the entity-level FIRPTA certificate is satisfactory.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
Minimal pushback -- this is a legal requirement. If Seller cannot deliver the certificate, Buyer should withhold 15% and structure the Closing statement accordingly.

### Risk Assessment
Failure to withhold when required exposes Buyer to liability for the withholding amount plus interest and penalties. This is a strict liability obligation. Never close without a FIRPTA certificate or appropriate withholding.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variations by asset type. Applies uniformly.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Many states have parallel withholding requirements for transfers by out-of-state sellers (e.g., California Form 593, Oregon ORS 314.258, New York TSB-M-03(1)R). Verify state-level withholding obligations independently.

---

## 11. OFAC / Anti-Money Laundering

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that neither Seller nor any of its affiliates, partners, members, shareholders, officers, directors, employees, or agents is: (a) a person or entity listed on OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List or any other OFAC sanctions list; (b) a person or entity with whom transactions are prohibited under any Executive Order; (c) in violation of any Anti-Money Laundering Laws, including the USA PATRIOT Act; or (d) a "Foreign Terrorist Organization" as designated by the US Department of State. Seller represents that its funds are derived from lawful sources and not from activities in contravention of any anti-money laundering or anti-bribery laws.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Require the representation to extend to Seller's direct AND indirect owners, particularly for opaque entity structures. The detailed seller-side PSA form includes a thorough OFAC representation covering persons "controlling or controlled by" Seller.
- If Seller has international investors, require a representation that Seller has conducted its own AML/KYC diligence on its capital sources.
- The representation should be both as of the Effective Date AND as of Closing, and should include a forward-looking component ("nor will they become").
- Push for the representation to include OECD and UN sanctions lists, not just OFAC lists, particularly if Seller has European or Asian investors.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues it cannot represent as to all indirect owners, particularly in fund structures with hundreds of limited partners.
- **Fallback**: Accept a representation limited to Seller, its general partner or managing member, and any person holding a 10% or greater direct or indirect interest. Require that Seller has implemented AML/KYC procedures consistent with applicable law for all investors.

### Risk Assessment
OFAC violations carry severe penalties, including criminal prosecution. A transaction with a blocked person is void, not merely voidable. Title insurers may refuse to insure if OFAC compliance is in question. This is not a negotiable business point -- it is a legal compliance requirement.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variations, though data center and critical infrastructure transactions may trigger additional CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) review if the seller or buyer has foreign government ownership.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Federal law applies uniformly across jurisdictions. Some states (e.g., New York, via the NY Department of Financial Services) have additional AML requirements for real estate transactions.

---

## 12. ERISA

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that the transaction does not constitute a "prohibited transaction" under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code, and that either: (a) Seller is not, and is not acting on behalf of, an "employee benefit plan" subject to ERISA; or (b) an applicable exemption from the prohibited transaction rules applies.

### Key Negotiation Points
- If Seller IS a plan or a plan asset entity, require identification of the specific ERISA exemption being relied upon (e.g., the Qualified Professional Asset Manager (QPAM) exemption under PTE 84-14, or the plan asset regulations under 29 CFR 2510.3-101).
- If Buyer's lender is making a loan to acquire the property and the seller is a plan asset entity, the lender will require an ERISA opinion or representation.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues that its ERISA status is not Buyer's concern.
- **Fallback**: If Seller refuses the ERISA representation, require Seller to indemnify Buyer against any liability arising from a prohibited transaction, and obtain Buyer's ERISA counsel's comfort that Buyer is not a "party in interest" that would be exposed under ERISA.

### Risk Assessment
ERISA prohibited transaction liability includes an excise tax of 15% of the amount involved for each year the transaction remains uncorrected, plus potential personal liability for fiduciaries. This is a specialized area; if ERISA is in play, involve ERISA counsel.

### Asset-Type Variations
ERISA issues are most common when the buyer or seller is a pension fund, sovereign wealth fund, or institutional investor whose capital includes plan assets. This applies across all asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
ERISA is a federal statute that preempts state law. No jurisdictional variations.

---

## 13. Bankruptcy / Solvency

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that: (a) Seller has not commenced a voluntary bankruptcy case or had entered against it an involuntary petition for relief under any federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar law; (b) Seller has not caused, suffered, or consented to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, administrator, conservator, or liquidator; (c) Seller has not made an assignment for the benefit of creditors; and (d) Seller is solvent and able to pay its debts as they become due.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Require the representation to be absolute -- no knowledge qualifier. A debtor knows whether it has filed for bankruptcy or consented to a receiver.
- Add a solvency representation: Seller is solvent, is able to pay its debts as they become due, and the fair value of its assets exceeds its liabilities (including contingent liabilities).
- Add a covenant that Seller will not dissolve, liquidate, or wind up its affairs, or distribute substantially all of its assets, for a period equal to the survival period of the representations and warranties, or while any claim by Buyer is pending.
- The NY Practical Law checklist emphasizes negotiating that Seller not dissolve for an agreed period (6 months to 1 year) after Closing, or while Buyer is enforcing rights under the Agreement.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller refuses the solvency representation, arguing it is unusual in CRE transactions.
- **Fallback**: Drop the express solvency representation but insist on the non-dissolution covenant and require that Seller maintain its existence for 12 months post-Closing (or the survival period, whichever is longer). Also negotiate for post-Closing security (holdback escrow, guarantee from a creditworthy parent, or letter of credit) to backstop the representations.
- **Pushback**: Seller is an SPE that will distribute proceeds immediately after Closing.
- **Fallback**: This is a significant concern because the SPE may be judgment-proof after distribution. Negotiate for: (1) a guaranty from the fund or sponsor entity backing the seller representations; (2) a holdback escrow equal to the rep liability cap; or (3) a right to name the parent/sponsor entity in any action for breach of representations.

### Risk Assessment
SPE sellers present the greatest judgment-collection risk. If the seller entity distributes all sale proceeds after closing and the buyer later discovers a breach of representations, the buyer may have no entity from which to recover damages. This is why the post-closing security mechanisms discussed in the "Survival and Caps" section are so critical.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **All types**: The risk is the same across asset classes; it is driven by entity structure rather than property type.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Fraudulent transfer / fraudulent conveyance laws (under the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act or state equivalents) may provide a remedy if Seller distributes proceeds to insiders while known claims are pending.

---

## 14. No Options to Purchase

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that no person has any right of first offer, right of first refusal, option to purchase, or other preferential right to acquire the Property or any portion thereof, arising through Seller, except as disclosed.

### Key Negotiation Points
- This should be a flat representation -- no knowledge qualifier. Seller granted these rights (or allowed them in leases) and should know whether they exist.
- The representation should cover not only purchase options but also expansion options that could effectively give a tenant control of additional space, and ROFO/ROFR rights that could delay or block the sale.
- If any such rights exist, require Seller to obtain waivers from the rights holders as a condition to Closing, with proof of waiver delivered to Buyer at least 5 business days before Closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
Minimal pushback on the representation itself. Pushback may arise on the obligation to obtain waivers of existing ROFR rights. If Seller cannot obtain a waiver, Buyer's options are: (1) require Seller to go through the offer process under the ROFR (which delays closing), or (2) terminate the Agreement if the ROFR holder exercises its right.

### Risk Assessment
An unwaived ROFR can kill a deal or, at minimum, delay closing by weeks or months while the ROFR process plays out. Even if the ROFR holder declines to exercise, the delay may cause financing commitments to expire.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Retail**: Anchor tenants frequently have purchase options or ROFRs.
- **Industrial**: Long-term single-tenant net leases may contain purchase options at a fixed price or a price based on cap rate formulas, which can be materially below market value.
- **Office**: Less common, but ground-floor retail tenants or major tenants may have negotiated purchase rights.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Some ROFR provisions may be subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities in common law jurisdictions. Verify enforceability.

---

## 15. Employees

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that: (a) Seller has no employees at the Property; (b) there are no employment agreements, union contracts, collective bargaining agreements, benefit plans, pension plans, or other employee-related obligations that will survive Closing or for which Buyer will have any liability; and (c) no employees of Seller's property manager or any contractor will have any claim for employment, benefits, or severance against Buyer.

### Key Negotiation Points
- If Seller DOES have employees (most common in multifamily), require: (1) a complete list of all employees, their positions, compensation, and benefits; (2) disclosure of any pending employment claims, EEOC charges, or labor disputes; (3) an obligation for Seller to terminate all employees effective as of Closing (or for Buyer to have the option of hiring them); and (4) an indemnity from Seller for all pre-Closing employment liabilities, including WARN Act liability.
- The UNICO Buyer Side form correctly addresses this with a comprehensive representation covering all employee-related obligations.
- If the Property has union employees, this is a highly complex area requiring labor counsel involvement. The collective bargaining agreement may contain successorship provisions that bind Buyer.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: In multifamily transactions, Seller argues that Buyer will need to hire property-level employees and should assume existing employee relationships.
- **Fallback**: Accept the option (but not the obligation) to hire existing employees, while requiring Seller to terminate all employees at Closing and be responsible for all pre-Closing liabilities including accrued vacation, sick leave, COBRA continuation, and any WARN Act obligations.

### Risk Assessment
Employment liability is particularly significant in multifamily and hospitality-adjacent properties where on-site staff is essential. Failure to address successorship obligations can result in the buyer inheriting collective bargaining agreements, pension withdrawal liability, and discrimination claims.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily**: Virtually always has on-site employees (maintenance staff, leasing agents, concierge). This is the highest-risk asset class for employee-related representations.
- **Office/Retail/Industrial**: Employees are typically employed by the property management company, not the property owner. Verify that the management agreement is being terminated at Closing and that the property manager's employees have no claim against Buyer.
- **Data Centers**: May have on-site operations and facilities staff. If the property is a powered shell, employees are less likely; if it is a turnkey or managed facility, staffing may be significant.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **California**: California has the most protective employment laws in the country. Cal-WARN Act, FEHA, and wage-and-hour requirements impose extensive obligations.
- **New York City**: The Displaced Building Service Workers Protection Act requires successors to retain building service employees for 90 days.
- **Illinois**: The Illinois Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act applies to closings, layoffs, and relocations involving 75 or more employees.

---

## 16. Insurance

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that: (a) the Property is covered by all-risk property insurance, commercial general liability insurance, and such other insurance as is customarily maintained for similar properties, with financially sound carriers; (b) all insurance policies are in full force and effect with premiums paid through the Closing Date; (c) Seller has not received any notice of cancellation or non-renewal; and (d) no claims are pending under the policies that would impair coverage.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Require Seller to deliver copies of all insurance policies and loss runs (claims history) for the prior 5 years as part of due diligence materials.
- The covenant to maintain insurance through Closing is as important as the representation regarding existing coverage.
- Require disclosure of any insurance claims that have been made in the prior 3-5 years, including the nature of the claim, amounts paid, and whether any reservation of rights was issued.
- If the Property has a history of claims that may affect insurability or premium rates, this should be disclosed.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues that it maintains insurance through its fund or portfolio-level program and cannot disclose all policy terms.
- **Fallback**: Accept that Seller need not disclose the full portfolio policy, but require a certificate of insurance confirming coverage types, limits, deductibles, and the named insured, together with loss runs for the Property.

### Risk Assessment
Insurance claims history directly affects the buyer's ability to obtain cost-effective insurance post-Closing. A property with a significant claims history (particularly water damage, mold, or general liability claims) may face higher premiums or coverage exclusions.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily**: Habitability and slip-and-fall claims are common. Require loss runs broken down by claim type.
- **Industrial**: Environmental liability insurance and pollution legal liability (PLL) coverage may be relevant.
- **Retail**: General liability claims from customer injuries are frequent.
- **Data Centers**: Business interruption and equipment breakdown insurance are critical. Verify that coverage is in place and adequate.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Florida / Gulf Coast / Earthquake Zones**: Properties in catastrophe-prone areas may have separate windstorm, flood, or earthquake deductibles and sub-limits. Verify that adequate catastrophe coverage is in place.

---

## 17. Financial Statements Accuracy

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that the financial statements (operating statements, budgets, and capital expenditure reports) delivered to Buyer are true, correct, and complete in all material respects and have been prepared in accordance with Seller's standard practices, consistently applied. Seller has not knowingly withheld or concealed any financial information that would make the delivered materials misleading.

### Key Negotiation Points
- The UNICO Buyer Side form includes an important "no fraudulent concealment" provision (Section 5.1.19): "Seller has not knowingly or intentionally withheld or concealed any documents or other information that would make the Due Diligence Materials made available or furnished to Buyer either untrue or misleading in any material manner."
- Push for this provision in every deal. It shifts the risk of omission onto Seller.
- Require that the financial statements cover at least the prior 3 calendar years plus year-to-date, and include all operating expenses, capital expenditures, tenant reimbursement reconciliations, and real estate tax bills.
- Add a representation that there are no material liabilities (whether accrued, contingent, or otherwise) affecting the Property that are not reflected in the financial statements or disclosed on a schedule.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues that financial statements are unaudited and should not be warranted.
- **Fallback**: Accept that the financial statements are unaudited, but maintain the representation that they are "true, correct and complete in all material respects" and were "prepared in accordance with Seller's standard accounting practices, consistently applied." This does not require GAAP compliance but does impose a duty of accuracy and consistency.

### Risk Assessment
Financial statement misrepresentation is the basis for many post-closing claims and may also support fraud claims that survive the general rep liability cap. If Seller intentionally inflates NOI (e.g., by capitalizing operating expenses or failing to accrue liabilities), the buyer may have paid a purchase price based on a materially overstated cap rate.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily**: Utility expenses, insurance costs, and maintenance expenses are the most commonly understated line items. Require detailed breakdowns.
- **Office**: Operating expense escalation reconciliations and base year calculations require particular scrutiny.
- **Retail**: Percentage rent calculations and CAM reconciliation statements require verification.

### Jurisdictional Notes
No significant jurisdictional variations for this representation.

---

## 18. Zoning and ADA Compliance

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that: (a) the current use of the Property complies with all applicable zoning laws, ordinances, and regulations; (b) the Property has a valid certificate of occupancy for its current use; (c) no zoning variance, special use permit, or conditional use permit is required for the current use that has not been obtained; and (d) to Seller's knowledge, the Property complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and all analogous state and local accessibility requirements.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Distinguish between zoning compliance (which can be verified by a zoning report and should be a flat representation) and ADA compliance (which requires physical inspection and is commonly knowledge-qualified).
- If the Property has any non-conforming use status (legal non-conforming / grandfathered), require detailed disclosure of the non-conformity, any limitations on modification or expansion, and any conditions that would terminate the non-conforming status.
- Require delivery of copies of all certificates of occupancy, zoning determinations, variance approvals, and any governmental correspondence regarding zoning compliance.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues that ADA compliance is too broad and uncertain to represent.
- **Fallback**: Accept a knowledge qualifier on ADA compliance, but require: (1) disclosure of any ADA demand letters, lawsuits, or complaints received in the prior 3 years; (2) disclosure of any ADA compliance studies or surveys in Seller's possession; and (3) the knowledge individual must include the property manager who has operational familiarity with accessibility issues.

### Risk Assessment
ADA non-compliance can result in expensive retrofitting requirements, litigation, and Department of Justice enforcement actions. For properties with significant public-facing space (retail, hospitality-adjacent office), this is a material risk.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Retail**: Highest ADA exposure due to public accommodation requirements.
- **Office**: Common areas, restrooms, and parking facilities must comply.
- **Multifamily**: Fair Housing Act accessibility requirements (for buildings built after March 13, 1991) are separate from but overlapping with ADA requirements.
- **Industrial**: Lower ADA exposure but still applies to office areas within industrial buildings.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **California**: The Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Building Code impose accessibility requirements that exceed federal ADA standards. California is the most active jurisdiction for ADA litigation.
- **New York**: NYC Local Law 58 requires accessibility compliance for alterations and changes of use.

---

## 19. Structural and Systems Condition

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that, to Seller's knowledge: (a) there are no material structural defects in the Improvements; (b) all building systems (HVAC, electrical, plumbing, elevator, fire/life safety, roofing) are in good working order; (c) no material capital repairs are required; and (d) Seller has not received any notice from any insurer, engineer, or governmental authority identifying any structural or systems deficiency that has not been remediated.

### Key Negotiation Points
- This representation will almost always be knowledge-qualified because Seller is not expected to guarantee physical condition. However, the notice prong (receipt of reports identifying deficiencies) should be a flat representation.
- Require delivery of all property condition reports, engineering reports, capital expenditure budgets, roof inspections, elevator inspection reports, and fire/life safety inspection reports in Seller's possession.
- This representation must be read in conjunction with (and is limited by) the as-is clause. The as-is clause generally disclaims implied warranties of condition, but express representations in the Agreement should survive.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues that the as-is clause eliminates any obligation to make condition representations.
- **Fallback**: The as-is clause and the express representations are complementary, not contradictory. Every well-drafted as-is clause carves out "except for Seller's express representations and warranties in this Agreement." (See Meadows form Section 4.6: "AS IS...with no right of setoff or reduction in the Purchase Price EXCEPT FOR SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT THAT EXPRESSLY SURVIVE THE CLOSING.") Insist on this carve-out and include a specific condition representation.

### Risk Assessment
Structural and systems deficiencies discovered post-Closing are among the most expensive remediation items. A roof replacement, facade repair, or major HVAC overhaul can cost millions. Buyer's primary protection is through due diligence (property condition assessment), not representations, but representations provide a backstop for latent defects.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office**: Focus on curtain wall/facade condition, elevator modernization needs, HVAC end-of-life, and fire/life safety system compliance.
- **Industrial**: Roof condition (especially for large flat roofs), floor loading capacity, clear heights, and dock equipment condition.
- **Multifamily**: Unit interiors, plumbing and electrical systems in older buildings, fire escapes, and facade compliance (NYC Local Law 11).
- **Data Centers**: Power distribution, cooling systems, UPS systems, and generator condition are the critical systems.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York City**: Local Law 11 (facade inspection), Local Law 26 (fire/life safety), and Local Law 87 (energy audits) create specific inspection and compliance obligations that generate reports Seller should be required to deliver.

---

## PART TWO: BUYER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

---

## 20. Buyer's Organization and Authority

### Preferred Position
Buyer represents that it is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing, with full power and authority to execute, deliver, and perform the Agreement. The Agreement has been duly authorized and constitutes a legal, valid, and binding obligation.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Keep Buyer's representations as narrow as possible. Resist expansion beyond the basic authority, OFAC, and non-contravention representations.
- If Buyer is a newly formed SPE (common in institutional acquisitions), be prepared to acknowledge that Buyer may need to obtain additional internal authorizations (e.g., investment committee approval) during the due diligence period. The UNICO Buyer Side form elegantly handles this: "Buyer may only be authorized to issue the Buyer Approval Notice and proceed to Closing if and when it receives additional internal authorizations during the Due Diligence Period."
- Resist any representation regarding "sufficient funds" or financial capacity -- this turns a PSA into a quasi-financing commitment. Buyer's remedy for failure to close is typically limited to forfeiture of the earnest money deposit; no additional financial capacity representation should be required.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller insists on a representation that Buyer has sufficient funds to close.
- **Fallback**: Offer a representation that Buyer has or will have access to funds sufficient to consummate the transaction, qualified by the explicit understanding that Buyer's obligation to close is not conditioned on obtaining financing. This gives Seller some comfort without creating a separate financial capacity cause of action.

### Risk Assessment
Buyer's organizational representations expose Buyer to claims of material breach if the representations are untrue. Keep them narrow and accurate.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes
Same jurisdictional considerations as Seller's organizational representations (foreign entity qualification, etc.).

---

## 21. Buyer's OFAC and AML Compliance

### Preferred Position
Buyer represents that neither Buyer nor its affiliates are in violation of OFAC sanctions or Anti-Money Laundering Laws, and that the funds used for the acquisition are derived from lawful sources. This representation should mirror the seller's OFAC representation.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Accept this representation -- it is a legal compliance requirement and refusing it would raise red flags.
- If Buyer is a fund with international investors, the representation should cover Buyer and its direct sources of funding, as well as any person holding a controlling interest. Avoid representing as to ALL limited partners -- the representation should cover persons with 10%+ ownership or control.
- The Meadows form includes a thorough formulation: Buyer represents that it is not a person "with whom a U.S. Person is prohibited from transacting business" and that it has "taken such measures as are required of Buyer under AML Laws to ascertain that the funds being invested by Buyer in the Property under this Agreement are derived from permissible sources."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
Accept this representation with reasonable scope limitations. The representation is standard and expected.

### Risk Assessment
Minimal risk if Buyer has conducted appropriate KYC/AML diligence on its own investors. The cost of non-compliance, however, is severe (criminal penalties, asset forfeiture).

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
Federal law applies uniformly. Some states (New York, California) have additional requirements for real estate transactions involving foreign investors.

---

## 22. Buyer's Non-Contravention and Bankruptcy

### Preferred Position
Buyer represents that the transaction will not violate any law, judgment, or order, or constitute a default under any agreement to which Buyer is a party. Buyer has not filed for or been the subject of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, or similar proceeding.

### Key Negotiation Points
- These are standard representations that Buyer should accept. Keep them symmetric with the seller's corresponding representations.
- Resist any expansion beyond the standard formulations, such as representations regarding Buyer's litigation history, financial condition, or business operations, which are not relevant to a real estate purchase.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
No significant pushback expected from Buyer's counsel. Accept these representations as part of the standard exchange.

### Risk Assessment
Minimal risk. These are factual representations within Buyer's knowledge.

### Asset-Type Variations
None.

### Jurisdictional Notes
None.

---

## PART THREE: CRITICAL MECHANICAL ISSUES

---

## 23. Knowledge Qualifiers

### Preferred Position
"To Seller's knowledge" should mean the actual knowledge of specifically named individuals who have primary responsibility for the matters that are the subject of the representations, AFTER reasonable investigation and inquiry. The named individuals should include the asset manager, property manager, and any in-house counsel or compliance officer with direct responsibility for the Property.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Actual vs. constructive knowledge**: Seller will insist on "actual knowledge" (what the named individuals actually know) rather than "constructive knowledge" (what they should have known). Buyer should push for at least a "duty to inquire" standard -- actual knowledge after reasonable inquiry. The UNICO forms use "current actual knowledge...without duty of inquiry or imputation of knowledge," which is the most seller-favorable formulation.
- **Identity of knowledge individuals**: CRITICAL. Always require that the knowledge individuals be identified by name in the Agreement. Avoid generic formulations like "any officer or director of Seller." The named individuals should be the persons with day-to-day operational knowledge -- typically the asset manager, the property manager (or the property management company's designated individual), and any deal principal. The detailed seller-side PSA form names only the "Designated Seller Representative" and expressly disclaims any duty of investigation.
- **Duty to inquire**: Buyer's strongest position is that knowledge individuals must conduct a "diligent inquiry" or "reasonable investigation" of Seller's files and records. Seller will resist any duty to inquire.
- **Fallback negotiation chain**:
  1. **Best position**: Actual knowledge of named individuals after diligent inquiry, with imputation of knowledge of Seller's agents and property managers.
  2. **First fallback**: Actual knowledge of named individuals after reasonable review of Seller's files relating to the Property.
  3. **Second fallback**: Actual knowledge of named individuals, without duty of inquiry, but with the named individuals including the property manager or on-site management personnel (who have operational awareness).
  4. **Last resort**: Actual knowledge of named individuals, without duty of inquiry or imputation, as in the UNICO Seller Side form -- but only if the named individuals are sufficiently close to Property operations to have meaningful awareness.
- **No personal liability**: Seller will insist (and Buyer should generally accept) that the named knowledge individuals have no personal liability and are acting solely on behalf of Seller. The UNICO forms and the Meadows form both include this protective language.
- **Property manager knowledge**: Even if Seller resists imputing the property manager's knowledge to Seller, push to include the property manager (or the property management firm's designated contact) as a named knowledge individual. The property manager is the most likely person to have actual knowledge of operational issues, tenant defaults, code violations, and environmental conditions.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller insists on a single knowledge individual (typically a remote asset manager) with no duty to inquire.
- **Fallback**: If Seller will not add the property manager as a knowledge individual, negotiate for a covenant that requires Seller to cause the property manager to certify to the knowledge individual that the property manager is not aware of any facts that would make the representations untrue. This provides an indirect path to the property manager's knowledge without formal imputation.

### Risk Assessment
The knowledge qualifier is the single most important modifier to every knowledge-qualified representation. A knowledge qualifier limited to a single remote individual with no duty to inquire can effectively render the representations meaningless. Conversely, a robust knowledge standard with multiple operational individuals and a duty to inquire provides genuine protection.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily**: The on-site property manager has the most granular operational knowledge. Insist on including this person.
- **Office**: The building manager and the asset manager should both be knowledge individuals.
- **Retail**: The property manager and the leasing agent/broker with the most tenant interaction should be included.
- **Industrial**: If the property is a single-tenant net lease, the knowledge individual should include the person who interacts with the tenant.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Knowledge standards are matters of contract law and are interpreted according to the governing law of the Agreement. Most jurisdictions enforce knowledge qualifiers as drafted, making the specific contractual formulation outcome-determinative.

---

## 24. Materiality Qualifiers

### Preferred Position
Resist blanket materiality qualifiers on Seller's representations. Where materiality is appropriate, define it with dollar thresholds rather than subjective standards like "material adverse effect."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Dual materiality problem**: If both the representation AND the bring-down condition use "material" qualifiers, the buyer faces a "double materiality" hurdle: the representation is only breached if a change is "material," and the closing condition is only failed if the breach is "material." Avoid this by ensuring that at least one level (either the representation or the bring-down) does not contain a materiality qualifier.
- **Defined thresholds vs. subjective standards**: Wherever possible, replace "material" with a defined dollar amount. For example, instead of "Seller has not received notice of any material violation," use "Seller has not received notice of any violation that could reasonably be expected to require remediation costs exceeding $50,000."
- **"Material Adverse Effect" definition**: If Seller insists on an MAE standard, define it carefully. Exclude changes resulting from: (a) general market conditions, (b) changes in law, (c) acts of war or terrorism, (d) natural disasters -- these should be addressed through casualty/condemnation provisions instead.
- The UNICO Seller Side form applies a blanket materiality qualifier at the outset: "Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser, as of the Effective Date and as of Closing, that the following matters are true, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS." This is extremely seller-favorable. On the buyer side, push for individual materiality qualifiers only where appropriate, not a blanket qualifier.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller insists on a blanket "in all material respects" qualifier.
- **Fallback**: Accept the blanket qualifier only if: (1) the bring-down condition does NOT also include a materiality qualifier (to avoid double materiality); and (2) the Agreement defines "material" with specific dollar thresholds for key representations (e.g., litigation, violations, contracts).

### Risk Assessment
An undefined materiality qualifier invites litigation over what is "material." Defined thresholds provide certainty for both parties and reduce the cost of enforcing or defending post-closing claims.

### Asset-Type Variations
Materiality thresholds should be calibrated to the asset's value, NOI, and typical operating expense profile. A $100,000 threshold is appropriate for a $200M office building but may be too high for a $50M multifamily property.

### Jurisdictional Notes
Materiality standards are interpreted under the governing law of the Agreement. New York courts apply a "reasonable investor" standard similar to securities law. Delaware courts tend to enforce defined materiality thresholds strictly.

---

## 25. Survival Period and Limitations

### Preferred Position
Seller's representations and warranties survive Closing for 18-24 months. Post-Closing indemnification claims may be brought at any time during the survival period, and any claim asserted (in writing with reasonable specificity) before the expiration of the survival period survives until resolved, even if resolution occurs after the survival period expires.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Survival period fallback chain**:
  1. **Best position**: 24 months for all representations; environmental representations survive for 36 months or the applicable statute of limitations, whichever is longer.
  2. **First fallback**: 18 months for general representations; 24 months for environmental, tax, and ERISA representations.
  3. **Second fallback**: 12 months for general representations (the UNICO Buyer Side standard); 18 months for environmental representations.
  4. **Last resort**: 6 months (the UNICO Seller Side and seller income property form standard). This is a Seller-favorable position that Buyer should resist vigorously.
- **Tolling**: Require that the survival period be tolled during the pendency of any claim asserted in writing before expiration. The Meadows form provides that claims must be "commenced" (i.e., legal action filed) within 30 days after the survival period expires, which is an extremely short fuse. Push for a provision that any claim asserted in writing (not just filed as litigation) within the survival period survives until final resolution.
- **Seller insistence on insurance-first**: The extremely detailed seller-side PSA form requires that "Purchaser agrees to first seek recovery under any insurance policies, Leases and Contracts prior to seeking recovery from Seller." This is a significant barrier to recovery.
  - **Buyer's fallback**: If Seller insists on insurance-first recovery, negotiate that: (1) the survival period is tolled during the pendency of any insurance claim; (2) if the insurer denies coverage or issues a reservation of rights letter, Buyer may immediately proceed against Seller without exhausting the insurance process; and (3) any recovery from insurance reduces Seller's liability dollar-for-dollar (preventing double recovery) but does not eliminate Buyer's right to pursue Seller for the uninsured portion or deductible.
- **Claims preservation in closing documents**: Per the NY Practical Law checklist, ensure that the closing documents (deed, assignment of leases, etc.) expressly preserve Buyer's right to assert claims for breach of representations. The extremely detailed seller-side PSA form includes a deed provision: "Nothing in this Deed shall prevent Grantee from relying on any representations and warranties...that expressly survive the delivery of this Deed, subject to all time, dollar and other limitations." Buyer should insist on similar language.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller insists on a 6-month survival period, arguing that the buyer had the opportunity to conduct thorough due diligence.
- **Fallback**: 9-12 months is a reasonable middle ground for general representations in a competitive market. Compensate for a shorter survival period by negotiating for: (1) a broader scope of representations; (2) a higher liability cap; (3) a lower deductible/basket; and (4) a post-closing escrow or guarantee to ensure recoverability.

### Risk Assessment
A survival period that is too short may expire before latent defects or undisclosed liabilities are discovered. Environmental contamination, structural defects, and lease-related issues may take 6-12 months to manifest. A 6-month survival period provides virtually no meaningful post-closing protection.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial / Environmental-sensitive properties**: Push for longer survival on environmental representations (24-36 months) because environmental issues may take years to manifest.
- **Multifamily**: Rent regulation violations, housing code violations, and employee-related claims may take time to surface. 12-18 months is a reasonable minimum.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: Statute of limitations for breach of contract is 6 years. The survival period is a contractual shortening of this period, which is generally enforceable in New York.
- **California**: Contractual shortening of limitation periods is generally enforceable under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. Section 360.5, but may not be shortened below the express terms of the contract.

## 26. Bring-Down at Closing

### Preferred Position
As a condition to Buyer's obligation to close, Seller shall deliver a bring-down certificate (the "Seller's Closing Certificate") certifying that all representations and warranties are true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date (or, if qualified by materiality, simply "true and correct"), with specific disclosure of any exceptions.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Avoid double materiality**: If the representations themselves are qualified by materiality, the bring-down should be to a "true and correct" standard (not "true and correct in all material respects"). If the representations are not qualified by materiality, the bring-down may include a materiality qualifier.
- **Form of certificate**: Attach the form of the Closing Certificate as an exhibit to the Agreement. The Meadows form (Exhibit F) provides a useful template: "all representations and warranties made by Seller in Section 5.1 of the Purchase Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of this Certificate except for (a) any changes that are not materially adverse and (b) any changes in the list of Leases or Contracts." Buyer should narrow the exceptions in this certificate as much as possible.
- **Consequences of inability to deliver a clean certificate**: If Seller cannot deliver the Closing Certificate because a representation is no longer true, Buyer should have the right to: (1) terminate the Agreement and receive a return of the deposit; (2) if the inaccuracy is due to Seller's breach or default, pursue all available remedies; or (3) waive the inaccuracy and proceed to close without reduction in price.
- **Seller's right to postpone Closing to cure**: The Meadows form allows Seller, upon discovery that a representation is inaccurate, to postpone Closing for up to 7 days to attempt to cure. This is reasonable if limited to a single, short postponement.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller wants the Closing Certificate to include broad exceptions for matters disclosed in due diligence materials.
- **Fallback**: Accept an exception for matters "specifically disclosed in writing to Buyer prior to the Effective Date" or "set forth on the disclosure schedules," but do NOT accept a blanket exception for "matters disclosed in the Due Diligence Materials" because that could encompass hundreds of documents that Buyer may not have reviewed in detail.

### Risk Assessment
The bring-down certificate is the mechanism by which Seller reaffirms its representations at Closing. Without it, Buyer has no assurance that conditions have not changed between signing and closing. Always require the certificate as a closing deliverable.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes
No significant jurisdictional variations, though the form and content of closing certificates may be dictated by local practice.

## 27. Update Rights and Obligations

### Preferred Position
Seller has an obligation (not merely a right) to notify Buyer of any change in conditions that would make any representation inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading. Upon receipt of such notice, Buyer has the right to: (a) terminate the Agreement and receive a full refund of the deposit; or (b) proceed to Closing and preserve all remedies for breach of representations.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Seller's right vs. obligation to update**: Seller-favorable forms give Seller the RIGHT to update disclosure schedules, which converts Seller's breach into a condition that Buyer must accept or walk away from. Buyer-favorable forms impose an OBLIGATION to update, which triggers Buyer's remedies. The distinction is critical.
- **Effect of updates on Buyer's remedies**: This is the core battleground.
  - **Buyer's best position**: Seller updates preserve Buyer's right to claim breach. An update does not cure or excuse the breach -- it merely puts Buyer on notice so it can decide whether to close or terminate.
  - **Seller's position**: An update by Seller modifies the representations. If Buyer elects to close after receiving the update, Buyer waives any claim based on the updated matter. (This is the approach in the UNICO Seller Side form: "Purchaser shall proceed with the Closing...with knowledge and acceptance of any facts, conditions or circumstances that render any of the representations and warranties in any material way inaccurate...and Seller shall have no liability as a result thereof.")
  - **Compromise position**: Distinguish between updates caused by Seller's fault and updates caused by events outside Seller's control. For seller-caused updates (e.g., Seller enters into a new contract without consent), Buyer retains all remedies including damages. For third-party-caused updates (e.g., a new tenant default), Buyer has the right to terminate but does not have a damages claim against Seller.
  - The UNICO Buyer Side form adopts this compromise: Seller has no liability if the buyer proceeds to close after an update, UNLESS "such Seller's representations and warranties are no longer accurate due to reasons or causes within Seller's control."
- **Timing**: Buyer should have at least 5-10 business days after receiving an update notice to decide whether to terminate. The Closing Date should be extended to accommodate this decision period.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller insists on full exoneration if it provides an update notice, regardless of cause.
- **Fallback**: Accept exoneration for updates caused by events outside Seller's control, but preserve remedies (including termination right, deposit return, and damages claim) for updates caused by Seller's breach of covenants or actions within Seller's control. This is the UNICO Buyer Side approach and represents a fair compromise.

### Risk Assessment
The update mechanism directly affects Buyer's post-signing risk. A Seller-favorable update right (automatic modification of representations plus deemed waiver if Buyer proceeds) effectively converts all representations into "as of the Effective Date only" representations, with the closing bring-down becoming purely optional for Buyer.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes
No significant jurisdictional variations.

## 28. Anti-Sandbagging

### Preferred Position
The Agreement should be silent on sandbagging (a pro-buyer "neutral" position in most jurisdictions), or should contain an express "pro-sandbagging" clause providing that Buyer's right to assert a claim for breach of representation is not affected by any knowledge or investigation of Buyer, before or after Closing.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Definitions**: "Pro-sandbagging" means Buyer can close with knowledge that a representation is untrue and still assert a post-closing claim. "Anti-sandbagging" means Buyer waives claims for breaches it knew about before Closing. The terminology is used here from Buyer's perspective.
- **The spectrum of positions**:
  1. **Pro-sandbagging (Buyer's best)**: Express provision preserving Buyer's claims regardless of Buyer's knowledge. "The right of Buyer to indemnification or other remedy shall not be affected by any investigation, knowledge, or awareness of Buyer at or before Closing."
  2. **Silent (strong Buyer position in most jurisdictions)**: Most jurisdictions default to a pro-sandbagging rule when the contract is silent. New York is expressly pro-sandbagging under CBS Inc. v. Ziff-Davis Publishing Co. Delaware also follows a pro-sandbagging default.
  3. **Modified anti-sandbagging (compromise)**: Buyer waives claims only for matters expressly disclosed in writing on the disclosure schedules, but does not waive claims based on information in due diligence materials that Buyer may or may not have reviewed. The NY Practical Law checklist recommends: "Negotiate that the purchaser does not waive any claims for misrepresentation even if the purchaser closes."
  4. **Full anti-sandbagging (Seller's position)**: Buyer waives all claims for breaches known to Buyer at Closing. The UNICO Seller Side form includes an optional anti-sandbagging clause (Section 5.4): "Buyer hereby expressly waives, relinquishes and releases any right or remedy...if (1) Buyer knew that such representation or warranty was untrue...at the time of the Closing and Buyer nevertheless closes title hereunder."
  5. **Extreme anti-sandbagging (the worst case)**: The extremely detailed seller-side PSA form goes further: "All of Seller's representations and warranties shall automatically be deemed modified to reflect Purchaser's Knowledge as of the end of the Study Period." And Purchaser's Knowledge is defined expansively to include "all matters and information disclosed in...any of the Documents received by or made available to Purchaser." This effectively deems Buyer to have known everything in the data room, regardless of whether Buyer actually reviewed it.
- **Buyer's fallback negotiation chain**:
  1. Express pro-sandbagging clause.
  2. Agreement is silent (rely on default rules).
  3. Anti-sandbagging limited to matters expressly disclosed on schedules attached to the Agreement (not due diligence materials generally).
  4. Anti-sandbagging limited to matters of which Buyer had "actual knowledge" (excluding constructive, imputed, or deemed knowledge).
  5. If Seller insists on a full anti-sandbagging clause, negotiate: (a) "knowledge" means only the actual, subjective knowledge of specifically named Buyer individuals (not Buyer's agents, attorneys, or consultants); (b) knowledge is not "deemed" to include information in due diligence materials unless Buyer's named knowledge individual actually reviewed and had subjective awareness of the specific inconsistency; and (c) the anti-sandbagging provision does not apply to claims based on Seller's fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues that it is inequitable for Buyer to close with knowledge of a breach and then assert a post-closing claim.
- **Fallback**: The response is that Seller's representations are a contractual allocation of risk, not a warranty of unknown facts. Buyer pays a purchase price based on the represented condition. If the representation is untrue, the purchase price was overstated, regardless of Buyer's knowledge. The NY Practical Law checklist takes this position: "Negotiate that the purchaser does not waive any claims for misrepresentation even if the purchaser closes. Ensure that claims are also preserved in the closing documents." If a middle ground is required, limit the anti-sandbagging to matters expressly disclosed on schedules, and carve out fraud.

### Risk Assessment
An aggressive anti-sandbagging provision combined with a broadly defined "Purchaser's Knowledge" (including deemed knowledge of all data room materials) can eviscerate Buyer's post-closing remedies. The detailed seller-side PSA form's "automatic deemed modification" clause is the most aggressive anti-sandbagging provision in the precedents and should be resisted strenuously.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation by asset type. The issue is purely contractual/structural.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: Pro-sandbagging jurisdiction under CBS Inc. v. Ziff-Davis Publishing Co., 75 N.Y.2d 496 (1990). The court held that a buyer's right to recover for breach of warranty is not affected by the buyer's knowledge of the untruth.
- **Delaware**: Generally follows a pro-sandbagging default under Cobalt Operating LLC v. James Crystal Enterprises, 300 A.3d 1 (Del. 2023).
- **California**: Less clearly pro-sandbagging. Some courts have applied "reasonable reliance" principles that could limit a buyer's recovery if the buyer knew of the breach before closing.
- **Illinois**: Courts generally enforce anti-sandbagging provisions when clearly drafted, but the default rule absent a contractual provision is less clearly established.
- **Texas**: Mixed authority. Contractual provisions are enforced as drafted.

## 29. Remedy for Breach -- Pre-Closing vs. Post-Closing

### Preferred Position
**Pre-Closing breach**: If a Seller representation is discovered to be untrue before Closing, Buyer may: (a) terminate the Agreement and receive a full refund of the deposit, plus reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the transaction; or (b) waive the breach and proceed to Closing, reserving all remedies for post-closing claims; or (c) seek specific performance of Seller's obligation to cure the breach.

**Post-Closing breach**: Buyer may pursue a claim for direct damages against Seller (subject to the survival period, liability cap, and basket/deductible), including an indemnification claim for losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from the breach.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Pre-Closing remedies**: The critical question is whether Buyer can pursue damages (not just termination) for pre-Closing breaches. In many seller-favorable forms, Buyer's sole pre-Closing remedy is termination with deposit return. Push for the right to also claim out-of-pocket expenses (title, survey, environmental, legal fees) if termination is caused by Seller's breach.
- **Post-Closing remedies**: Ensure that the Agreement expressly provides for indemnification, not just a "survival" of representations. The Meadows form includes a detailed indemnification provision: "Seller shall indemnify and defend Buyer against and hold Buyer harmless from all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees."
- **Exclusion of consequential damages**: Seller will insist on excluding consequential, punitive, special, and exemplary damages. The detailed seller-side PSA form limits liability to "direct, but not consequential, incidental, indirect, punitive, special or exemplary, damages or lost profits." This is a reasonable limitation that Buyer should generally accept for breach-of-representation claims. However, resist any exclusion of consequential damages for Seller's fraud.
- **Cure period**: The Meadows form gives Seller a 15-day cure period before a post-closing claim becomes actionable. This is reasonable if the cure period tolls the survival period.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues that the buyer's sole pre-Closing remedy should be termination with deposit return.
- **Fallback**: Accept termination as the sole remedy for "no fault" terminations (e.g., title objections, casualty, condemnation), but insist on additional remedies (specific performance, damages, expense reimbursement) when termination is caused by Seller's willful breach or default.

### Risk Assessment
The remedy structure determines the practical value of the representations. Representations without a meaningful remedy are aspirational statements, not enforceable protections. Ensure that the indemnification obligation is backed by recourse to assets (holdback, escrow, guarantee).

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: Specific performance is generally available for breach of a real estate purchase agreement because real property is deemed "unique." However, specific performance may not be available against a seller that has already conveyed the property to a third party.

---

## 30. Interaction with As-Is Clause

### Preferred Position
The as-is clause expressly carves out Seller's representations and warranties that survive Closing, and the closing documents expressly preserve Buyer's right to assert claims for breach of representations.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Every PSA for institutional CRE includes an as-is clause. The as-is clause and the representations section must be read together. The critical drafting point is the carve-out.
- **Standard carve-out language**: "THE PROPERTY IS BEING SOLD 'AS IS'...EXCEPT FOR SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT THAT EXPRESSLY SURVIVE THE CLOSING." The Meadows form and the seller income property form both use this formulation.
- **Release clause**: Many agreements include a release of claims in addition to the as-is disclaimer. The Meadows form includes a broad release: "Buyer...hereby releases Seller and Seller Parties...from, and waives all claims and liability...against Seller and Seller Parties." Ensure that the release contains a carve-out for claims arising from breach of surviving representations and warranties.
- **Closing documents**: The detailed seller-side PSA form includes a deed provision preserving representation claims, and the assignment of leases and contracts expressly references the surviving representations. Ensure that ALL closing documents contain similar preservation language.
- **California Civil Code Section 1542 waiver**: In California, as-is clauses often include a waiver of Cal. Civ. Code Section 1542 (which provides that "a general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist"). The Meadows form includes a general waiver of similar state laws. Ensure that the waiver applies only to claims released under the as-is clause and NOT to claims arising from breach of surviving representations.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues that the as-is clause should override all representations, leaving only the due diligence period as Buyer's protection.
- **Fallback**: This is a non-starter. The as-is clause and the representations are complementary protections. The as-is clause protects Seller against claims that Seller should have disclosed conditions that were discoverable through inspection. The representations protect Buyer against conditions that are NOT discoverable through reasonable inspection (latent defects, undisclosed liabilities, lease irregularities). Both serve a legitimate function. Insist on the carve-out.

### Risk Assessment
Without a clear carve-out for surviving representations, a court could interpret the as-is clause as extinguishing all post-closing claims, including claims for fraudulent concealment in some jurisdictions. The carve-out language is essential.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation. The as-is clause is universal in institutional CRE transactions.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Texas**: Texas courts have enforced as-is clauses to bar virtually all buyer claims, including fraud claims in some cases. The carve-out for surviving representations must be explicit and unambiguous.
- **New York**: Courts generally enforce as-is clauses but recognize exceptions for fraud and active concealment.
- **California**: The waiver of Section 1542 is enforceable if knowing and intentional, but does not bar claims for fraud.

---

## 31. Liability Cap

### Preferred Position
The aggregate liability of Seller for breach of all representations and warranties shall not exceed 5% of the Purchase Price.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Cap fallback chain**:
  1. **Best position**: 5-10% of Purchase Price.
  2. **UNICO Buyer Side standard**: Greater of $1,000,000 and 5% of Purchase Price.
  3. **Market middle ground**: 3% of Purchase Price.
  4. **UNICO Seller Side standard**: 2.5% of Purchase Price.
  5. **Detailed seller-side PSA form**: 1% of Purchase Price (the "Claim Cap"). This is aggressive and should be resisted.
- **Fraud carve-out**: The liability cap should NOT apply to claims based on Seller's fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or willful misconduct. This is the single most important carve-out.
- **Relationship to post-closing escrow**: If a holdback escrow is established to backstop the representations, the escrow amount should equal the liability cap. If the escrow is less than the cap, Buyer retains the right to pursue Seller directly for amounts above the escrow.
- **Recourse beyond the SPE**: If Seller is an SPE that will distribute proceeds after Closing, the liability cap is meaningless without recourse to a creditworthy entity. Negotiate for: (1) a guaranty from the sponsor or parent entity up to the cap amount; (2) a holdback escrow funded at Closing; or (3) a covenant that Seller will maintain the cap amount in reserves for the duration of the survival period.
- The NY Practical Law checklist recommends: "Negotiate for the largest possible security amount, which could be between 1% to 10% of the purchase price." And: "Negotiate that the seller entity cannot be dissolved or wound-up either for an agreed period after the closing or at any time while the purchaser is enforcing its rights."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller insists on a 1% cap, citing the detailed seller-side PSA form.
- **Fallback**: Counter with 2.5-3% as the market standard, supported by the UNICO forms. If Seller holds firm at a low cap, compensate by: (1) insisting on a fraud carve-out (no cap for fraud); (2) requiring a post-closing escrow equal to the cap amount; and (3) lengthening the survival period.

### Risk Assessment
The liability cap must be calibrated to the risk profile of the deal. A 1% cap on a $100M deal provides $1M of protection -- potentially inadequate for a single environmental remediation, structural repair, or unfunded TI obligation. On the other hand, caps above 5% are rare in institutional CRE and may reflect a poorly negotiated deal or unusual risk factors that should be addressed differently (e.g., through price adjustment or escrow).

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial / environmentally sensitive**: Higher caps (3-5%) are justified given the potential magnitude of environmental remediation costs.
- **Multifamily**: Employee-related liabilities and rent regulation compliance issues may justify a higher cap.
- **Data Centers**: Equipment and infrastructure replacement costs can be enormous; consider a higher cap.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Caps are generally enforceable as contractual limitations of liability in all US jurisdictions, provided they are not unconscionable and do not purport to limit liability for fraud.

---

## 32. Basket / Deductible for Claims

### Preferred Position
No basket or deductible. If one is required, use a "tipping" basket (also called a "first dollar" basket): claims are only actionable if the aggregate amount exceeds the basket threshold, but once the threshold is exceeded, Seller is liable for the FULL amount of claims from dollar one.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Types of baskets**:
  1. **No basket (Buyer's best)**: Every dollar of loss is recoverable, subject to the liability cap.
  2. **Tipping basket / first-dollar basket**: Claims must aggregate above a threshold (e.g., $50,000-$100,000) before any claim is actionable, but once the threshold is exceeded, the FULL amount is recoverable. This prevents nuisance claims while protecting Buyer on legitimate losses.
  3. **True deductible**: Claims must aggregate above a threshold, and Seller is only liable for amounts IN EXCESS of the threshold. Buyer bears the first-dollar loss up to the deductible. This is more seller-favorable.
  4. **Per-claim mini-basket + aggregate basket**: Individual claims below a mini-threshold (e.g., $10,000) are excluded entirely, and only claims exceeding the mini-threshold count toward the aggregate basket. This is the most seller-favorable and most complex structure.
- **Basket amount fallback chain**:
  1. No basket.
  2. Tipping basket at $25,000-$50,000.
  3. Tipping basket at $50,000-$100,000 (UNICO Buyer Side: $25,000 per claim; UNICO Seller Side: $50,000 per claim).
  4. True deductible at $100,000-$250,000 (the Meadows form: claims must "aggregate more than $100,000").
  5. The detailed seller-side PSA form: $100,000 true deductible, but "the full amount of such valid claims against Seller, and not just the amount above $100,000 shall be actionable" -- this is actually a tipping basket, not a deductible, despite the high threshold.
- **Interaction with liability cap**: The basket reduces Buyer's effective recovery range. If the cap is $1M and the deductible is $100,000, Buyer's effective recovery range is $100,000 to $1M. Below $100,000, Buyer has no recovery. Above $1M, Buyer has no recovery. This compressed range significantly limits the utility of the representations.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller insists on a true deductible to avoid paying the first dollar of loss.
- **Fallback**: Accept a tipping basket (which eliminates nuisance claims without penalizing Buyer for the first-dollar loss) at a threshold that is reasonable relative to the purchase price. For a $100M deal, a $50,000-$100,000 tipping basket is reasonable; $250,000+ is excessive.

### Risk Assessment
The basket/deductible interacts with the liability cap to define the effective "window" of Buyer's recovery. Negotiate the basket and cap together as a package.

### Asset-Type Variations
Calibrate the basket to the property's operating scale. A $50,000 basket on a $50M multifamily property is proportionally much more impactful than on a $200M office building.

### Jurisdictional Notes
Baskets and deductibles are contractual provisions enforced as written in all US jurisdictions.

---

## 33. Schedule Disclosure Mechanics

### Preferred Position
All disclosure schedules are attached to the Agreement as of the Effective Date and are incorporated by reference. Matters disclosed on one schedule are not deemed disclosed on any other schedule unless specifically cross-referenced. Updated schedules delivered at Closing must be delivered at least 5 business days before the Closing Date for Buyer's review.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Cross-reference rule**: Seller will argue that disclosure on any schedule constitutes disclosure for all purposes. Buyer should resist and require specific cross-referencing, because a matter disclosed on the Lease Schedule is not necessarily relevant to the Litigation Schedule, and treating it as such could inadvertently discharge Seller's obligation to specifically disclose litigation affecting a particular lease.
- **Specificity requirement**: Schedules should contain sufficient detail for Buyer to evaluate the disclosed matter. Avoid general or vague disclosures such as "various pending matters" or "as reflected in the due diligence materials."
- **Updated schedules at Closing**: Updated schedules should be provided in advance of Closing (not at Closing) so that Buyer has time to evaluate and respond. The update mechanism should be governed by the Update Rights provisions discussed above.
- **Deemed disclosure from due diligence materials**: Seller will attempt to add a blanket qualifier that all representations are "except as may otherwise be disclosed in the Title Commitment, the Due Diligence Materials or in Exhibit N." (This is the UNICO Seller Side formulation.) Buyer should resist this, as it effectively converts the entire data room into a disclosure schedule, overwhelming specific representations with volume.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues that requiring detailed schedules is burdensome and duplicative of the due diligence materials.
- **Fallback**: Accept that schedules may incorporate by reference specific identified documents from the due diligence materials (e.g., "the environmental reports listed on Schedule 5.1.10"), but do NOT accept blanket incorporation of all due diligence materials as deemed disclosures.

### Risk Assessment
Poorly drafted disclosure schedules are the source of many post-closing disputes. A schedule that says "see Phase I ESA" does not disclose any specific environmental condition -- it merely points to a voluminous document. Insist on specificity.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
No significant jurisdictional variation, though courts in different jurisdictions may differ on whether a general schedule reference constitutes adequate disclosure.

---

## 34. Post-Closing Security

### Preferred Position
Seller shall fund a holdback escrow at Closing in an amount equal to the liability cap (or a negotiated percentage of the Purchase Price), to be held by the Title Company as escrow agent, available to satisfy post-closing claims for breach of representations. The escrow shall be released to Seller at the expiration of the survival period, less any amounts subject to pending claims.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Forms of security** (in order of Buyer preference):
  1. **Cash escrow**: Funded from the purchase price at Closing, held by a neutral escrow agent. Most liquid and most reliable.
  2. **Letter of credit**: Irrevocable, unconditional, standby letter of credit from a major US bank, drawable on demand. Provides liquidity without tying up Seller's cash.
  3. **Guaranty from creditworthy parent/sponsor**: A guarantee from the fund, sponsor, or parent entity that is not an SPE. This provides recourse beyond the SPE but requires credit analysis of the guarantor.
  4. **Covenant not to dissolve + maintenance of reserves**: Seller covenants to maintain its existence and a minimum net worth equal to the liability cap for the duration of the survival period. Less reliable because it depends on Seller's compliance.
- **Escrow mechanics**: The escrow agreement should provide that: (a) the escrow agent disburses to Seller at the expiration of the survival period, net of amounts subject to pending claims; (b) any claim asserted in writing before the survival period expires "locks up" the claimed amount in escrow until resolved; (c) disputes are resolved by agreement, arbitration, or court order; and (d) escrow agent has no liability for disbursement in accordance with the Agreement or a court order.
- The NY Practical Law checklist recommends: "Negotiate that the seller must post security in case the representations and warranties turn out to be false after the closing. The seller may: deposit funds in escrow; give a letter of credit; or give a guarantee by a corporate parent."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Seller argues that a holdback escrow is unnecessary because Seller is a well-capitalized entity.
- **Fallback**: If Seller refuses a holdback, require: (1) a guaranty from the fund or sponsor entity; (2) a covenant not to dissolve or distribute substantially all assets for the survival period; and (3) an express acknowledgment that the representations constitute contractual obligations that are not extinguished by Seller's dissolution or distribution of proceeds.
- **Pushback**: Seller agrees to a holdback but at 50% of the liability cap.
- **Fallback**: Accept a reduced holdback if: (1) the guaranty or other security covers the difference; or (2) the escrow amount increases if Seller dissolves or distributes proceeds during the survival period.

### Risk Assessment
Post-closing security is the enforcement mechanism that gives practical meaning to the representations. Without security, an SPE seller that distributes proceeds after closing may be judgment-proof, rendering the representations valueless regardless of their scope, survival, or cap.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation by asset type. The need for post-closing security is driven by the seller's entity structure, not the property type.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Escrow agreements are generally governed by the law of the escrow agent's jurisdiction. Ensure consistency with the governing law of the PSA.
