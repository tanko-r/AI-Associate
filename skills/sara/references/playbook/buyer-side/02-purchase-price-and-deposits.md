# Purchase Price, Deposits, and Payment Mechanics -- Buyer Side Playbook

---

## 1. Purchase Price Structure

### Preferred Position
The purchase price should be stated as a fixed dollar amount with no escalation clauses, adjustment mechanisms, or earn-out provisions that could increase the price post-execution. The buyer wants maximum clarity and finality. Sample language:

> "The Purchase Price for the Property shall be [AMOUNT] Dollars ($[AMOUNT]). Subject to the adjustments, apportionments and credits as hereinafter set forth, the Purchase Price shall be paid on the Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds."

The buyer should insist that any prorations, credits (e.g., for existing leasing costs, security deposits, prepaid rents, deferred maintenance), and adjustments run through the closing statement and reduce the net amount payable at closing. All such credits should be "against the Purchase Price" rather than separate side obligations.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Confirm the purchase price is net of all credits, prorations, and adjustments applied through the closing statement -- never a gross number with side agreements for reimbursement.
- Resist any "purchase price adjustment" mechanisms tied to occupancy, rent collections, or NOI floors at closing. These are seller protections that shift risk to buyer.
- Ensure the agreement specifies that the purchase price includes all personal property, intangible property, contract rights, and permits -- no separate consideration for these items unless there is a deliberate tax allocation strategy.
- Watch for hidden additions to the purchase price, such as mandatory assumption of seller's outstanding tenant improvement obligations without a corresponding credit.
- Negotiate that Existing Leasing Costs (TI/LC obligations outstanding under current leases) are credited against the Purchase Price at closing, as seen in the UNICO Buyer form (Section 7.3.2): "At Closing, Buyer shall receive a credit against the Purchase Price in the total amount of the Existing Leasing Costs."
- If seller has extension fee provisions (as in the Seller Income Property form), push to have any extension fees credited against the purchase price rather than treated as additional non-refundable consideration.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Seller requests a purchase price floor or adjustment mechanism tied to occupancy at closing.** Fallback: Accept a narrow adjustment only for specifically identified major tenant defaults or lease terminations occurring between signing and closing, with a defined dollar threshold, and only if the event gives rise to a termination right rather than a price reduction. Tradeoff: You avoid an open-ended price renegotiation mechanism but acknowledge material economic changes.
2. **Seller insists leasing cost credits are calculated differently.** Fallback: Agree to credit only outstanding (unpaid) Existing Leasing Costs rather than all future leasing costs, with Seller providing documentation of amounts already paid. Tradeoff: Buyer bears risk that Seller overstates amounts already paid, so require reasonable supporting documentation and a post-closing true-up.
3. **Seller proposes personal property is excluded or separately priced.** Fallback: Accept exclusion of specifically scheduled items (e.g., artwork, branded fixtures) but insist all building systems, maintenance equipment, and operational personal property are included. Tradeoff: Cosmetic items are dispensable; operational ones are not.

### Risk Assessment
**MEDIUM** -- Purchase price structure is typically settled in the LOI, but the devil is in how credits, prorations, and leasing cost allocations are documented in the PSA. Failure to secure proper credits can result in hundreds of thousands of dollars of unanticipated post-closing exposure.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office/Retail:** Significant TI/LC exposure. Existing Leasing Cost credits can be substantial. Scrutinize the leasing cost schedule carefully.
- **Industrial:** Lower TI/LC exposure but watch for deferred capital expenditures (roof, HVAC, dock levelers) that may warrant a separate credit.
- **Multifamily:** Focus on concession burn-off schedules and whether in-place rents accurately reflect economic rents. Purchase price adjustments for occupancy drops are more common.
- **Data Center:** May involve significant personal property (generators, cooling systems, fiber infrastructure). Ensure the purchase price allocation properly accounts for these items, which may qualify for accelerated depreciation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Transfer taxes** vary dramatically by jurisdiction and directly affect the economics of the purchase price. In New York, the combined state and city transfer tax can exceed 2.6% of price; in many states it is nominal. The PSA should clearly allocate who bears transfer tax liability.
- In jurisdictions with documentary stamp taxes calculated on the "consideration," ensure the purchase price stated in the deed matches the PSA and that no argument exists for a higher taxable consideration.
- Some jurisdictions (e.g., New York) impose a "mansion tax" or additional transfer tax at higher price thresholds.

## 2. Earnest Money Deposit Amount and Timing

### Preferred Position
The buyer wants the smallest deposit possible, delivered as late as possible, and remaining fully refundable for the longest period. Target structure:

- **Amount:** 1-2% of the purchase price (for institutional deals, this is standard; market range is 1-5%). On an $86M deal like the ASB Hardware Block form, the deposit was approximately 4% ($3.5M), which is aggressive for seller.
- **Timing:** Deposit should be due within 2-3 business days after the Effective Date (the date of mutual execution), not on the Effective Date itself. The UNICO Buyer form uses "Within 2 Business Days after the Effective Date." The Meadows form required deposit "within two (2) business days after execution."
- **Refundability:** Fully refundable through the end of the Due Diligence Period, with specific additional refund triggers for title objections, estoppel failures, casualty/condemnation, rep and warranty failures, and seller default.

Sample language:

> "Within two (2) Business Days after the Effective Date, Buyer shall deposit with Escrow Agent via wire transfer the Earnest Money Deposit in immediately available funds. The Earnest Money Deposit shall be fully refundable to Buyer until Buyer delivers the Buyer Approval Notice pursuant to Section [X], and thereafter shall be non-refundable except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement."

### Key Negotiation Points
- Never agree to deposit the earnest money "on the Effective Date" -- always negotiate for at least 1-2 business days to allow wire processing. The ASB form (seller side) required deposit "on the Effective Date," which is aggressive.
- Ensure the deposit is held by the Escrow Agent (typically the title company), not released directly to seller. The Seller Income Property form included a bracketed option for Escrow Holder to "promptly pay the Initial Deposit to Seller" -- this is a red flag for buyer and should be resisted.
- Insist that failure to timely deposit does not automatically terminate the agreement. The ASB form provides that "If Purchaser fails to deliver the Deposit to Escrow Agent on the Effective Date, this Agreement shall, at Seller's election, terminate." Buyer should instead negotiate for a notice and cure period (e.g., 2 business days after written notice).
- Enumerate every scenario in which the deposit is returned to buyer. Cross-reference all termination rights.
- If seller insists on a large deposit, negotiate to split it into an Initial Deposit (smaller, at signing) and an Additional Deposit (larger, at expiration of due diligence). This preserves optionality.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Seller demands 3-5% deposit.** Fallback: Agree to 3% but structure as a split deposit -- 1% at signing (refundable during DD), additional 2% going hard at DD expiration. Tradeoff: Less cash at risk during the free-look period.
2. **Seller demands deposit on the Effective Date.** Fallback: Agree to 1 business day after the Effective Date. Tradeoff: Minimal practical difference but preserves time for internal wire processing.
3. **Seller demands that failure to timely deposit automatically terminates the agreement.** Fallback: Accept automatic termination but only after seller provides written notice and buyer has 2 business days to cure. Tradeoff: Protects against inadvertent termination due to wire delays.
4. **Seller wants deposit released directly to seller (day-one hard money).** Fallback: Strongly resist. If seller insists, limit to a small portion ($100 Independent Consideration -- see Section 3 below) with the balance held in escrow. Tradeoff: Giving up any portion of the deposit before closing creates collection risk if the deal terminates.

### Risk Assessment
**HIGH** -- The deposit amount and refundability terms directly determine the buyer's financial exposure if the deal does not close. On a $50M+ deal, a non-refundable deposit can represent millions of dollars at risk. Getting this wrong is one of the most consequential negotiation failures in a PSA.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily:** Deposits of 3-5% are more common in competitive markets due to the depth of buyer pool.
- **Data Center/Industrial (single-tenant NNN):** Deposits may be lower (1-2%) given the simpler underwriting and shorter due diligence periods.
- **Office (multi-tenant):** Standard 2-3% deposits. The complexity of tenant estoppel requirements often creates additional refund triggers.
- **Retail:** Watch for seller demands for higher deposits to compensate for taking the asset off market during an extended closing period.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- In New York, it is customary for the seller's attorney (not a title company) to hold the deposit in escrow. Buyers should insist on a separate escrow agreement with clear disbursement procedures.
- In some jurisdictions, escrow agents may be required to hold deposits in state-specific trust accounts (e.g., Washington, Oregon -- lawyer trust accounts).
- The IL Pro-Buyer form contemplates a separate "strict joint order escrow agreement" alongside the PSA, which adds procedural protections for buyer.

## 3. Independent Contract Consideration ($100 Hard Money)

### Preferred Position
The buyer should accept the $100 Independent Consideration provision as it is standard market practice and serves a legitimate legal purpose -- it provides consideration to support the option period (due diligence) and helps ensure enforceability of the agreement in jurisdictions where courts scrutinize adequacy of consideration. Sample language from the UNICO Buyer form:

> "Seller and Buyer agree that $100 of the Earnest Money Deposit ('Independent Contract Consideration') shall be non-refundable and shall be paid to Seller immediately upon request by Seller. The Independent Contract Consideration has been bargained for and agreed to as additional consideration for Seller's execution and delivery of this Agreement. At Closing, the Independent Contract Consideration shall be applied to the Purchase Price. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall be entitled to retain the Independent Contract Consideration."

### Key Negotiation Points
- Ensure the Independent Consideration is carved out of (not in addition to) the Earnest Money Deposit. It should reduce the deposit, not supplement it.
- Confirm it is applied to the Purchase Price at Closing so buyer is not paying twice.
- Limit the amount to $100. Some seller forms attempt to increase this to $500 or $1,000 -- resist anything above $100.
- The Meadows form correctly treats it: "One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) of the Deposit is delivered to the Title Company for delivery by the Title Company to Seller as 'Independent Consideration'...which amount has been bargained for and agreed to as consideration for Seller's execution and delivery of this Agreement."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Seller seeks to increase the Independent Consideration to $500 or $1,000.** Fallback: Accept up to $500 if necessary to close the deal, but note this is purely cosmetic in the context of institutional deals. Tradeoff: Immaterial dollar amount, but conceding on principle may signal willingness to concede on other points.
2. **Seller wants the Independent Consideration paid directly (not carved from the deposit).** Fallback: Acceptable as long as the amount is $100 and credited against the Purchase Price at Closing. Tradeoff: Negligible.

### Risk Assessment
**LOW** -- This is a standard provision with minimal economic impact. The primary risk is failing to include it in jurisdictions (e.g., Texas) where courts more carefully scrutinize option consideration.

### Asset-Type Variations
None -- this provision is uniform across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Texas:** Independent consideration is particularly important because Texas courts treat the due diligence period as an option, and options require independent consideration to be enforceable. Always include this provision for Texas deals.
- **New York:** Less critical because New York contract law does not generally require separate consideration for an option within a bilateral contract, but market practice includes it nonetheless.
- **Illinois:** The IL Pro-Buyer form does not include Independent Consideration, which is acceptable practice in Illinois but buyer should consider adding it for belt-and-suspenders protection.

## 4. Deposit Going Hard Mechanics

### Preferred Position
The deposit should remain fully refundable until buyer affirmatively waives its due diligence contingency by delivering a written "Buyer Approval Notice" (or equivalent). The deposit goes hard (becomes non-refundable) only upon delivery of the Buyer Approval Notice, with carve-outs for specific post-DD refund events. The buyer's preferred mechanics:

1. **Affirmative approval required:** Buyer must deliver a written Buyer Approval Notice to make the deposit go hard. If buyer fails to deliver the notice by the DD deadline, the agreement terminates and the deposit is returned. This is the UNICO Buyer approach (Section 3.2): "If Buyer fails to deliver the Buyer Approval Notice by the Due Diligence Deadline...this Agreement shall terminate and Escrow Agent shall refund the Earnest Money Deposit to Buyer."
2. **Post-DD refund carve-outs:** Even after the deposit goes hard, it should be refundable in the following circumstances:
   - Seller default or material breach of representations
   - Failure of closing conditions (title defects, estoppel failures)
   - Material casualty or condemnation (buyer election to terminate)
   - New title exceptions discovered after DD expiration
   - Failure to obtain loan assumption approval (if applicable)
   - Material adverse change in seller representations

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Resist the deemed-approval trap.** Some seller forms provide that if buyer fails to deliver a termination notice by the DD deadline, the deposit automatically goes hard. This is the approach in the Seller Income Property form: "If Buyer fails to deliver the Termination Notice...Buyer shall be deemed to have timely provided an Approval Notice." The UNICO Seller form also uses this approach. The buyer's preferred position is the opposite: silence = termination.
- **Resist the "affirmative waiver" approach** where the deposit goes hard immediately upon signing with refundability only during DD. This front-loads risk and can create ambiguity.
- Enumerate all post-DD refund events explicitly and ensure they are cross-referenced in the deposit refund provision.
- Require that the Buyer Approval Notice is contingent on buyer having obtained all necessary internal investment committee approvals (Section 6.2 of UNICO Buyer form acknowledges this: "Buyer may only be authorized to issue the Buyer Approval Notice and proceed to Closing if and when it receives additional internal authorizations during the Due Diligence Period").
- Watch for provisions that make the deposit go hard incrementally (e.g., 50% at DD expiration, 50% at estoppel deadline). If acceptable, ensure each increment has its own refund triggers.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Seller insists on deemed-approval (silence = hard deposit).** Fallback: Accept this structure but negotiate for (a) seller's obligation to deliver a reminder notice at least 3 business days before the DD deadline, and (b) an extended cure period (2 business days) after the DD deadline for buyer to deliver a termination notice if it inadvertently missed the deadline. Tradeoff: Increases administrative burden on buyer's deal team but prevents accidental loss of termination right.
2. **Seller insists deposit goes hard on day one.** Fallback: Agree only if (a) the deposit amount is nominal (e.g., $100,000 or less) and an additional deposit is due at DD expiration, or (b) the purchase price reflects the additional risk buyer is taking. Tradeoff: Significant risk shift to buyer that must be reflected in economics.
3. **Seller insists on fewer post-DD refund triggers.** Fallback: At minimum, preserve refund rights for (a) seller default, (b) failure of estoppel condition, and (c) material casualty/condemnation. These are the three most critical buyer protections. Tradeoff: Losing refund rights for title objections after DD is manageable if the title review period is built into the DD period.

### Risk Assessment
**CRITICAL** -- The deposit going-hard mechanic is among the most economically consequential provisions in the PSA. A deposit that goes hard prematurely, or with insufficient refund carve-outs, exposes the buyer to forfeiture of millions of dollars in scenarios where the deal legitimately should not close.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office (multi-tenant):** Post-DD refund triggers for estoppel failures are particularly important given the number of tenants and the likelihood of estoppel issues.
- **Retail:** Anchor tenant estoppels are critical. Ensure the deposit refund right is tied to receipt of acceptable estoppels from anchor tenants.
- **Industrial (single-tenant NNN):** The single tenant's estoppel is the entire ball game. Tie deposit refundability to receipt of a conforming estoppel from the sole tenant.
- **Data Center:** May require additional post-DD refund triggers for regulatory approvals, fiber/utility easement confirmations, or power allocation confirmations.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- In New York, the traditional approach is that the deposit goes hard at signing (no free-look period), though institutional deals increasingly include a due diligence period. The NY Checklist notes that the "purchaser should negotiate to include a due diligence review contingency."
- In many Western states (Oregon, Washington, Colorado), a due diligence period with buyer's right to terminate for any reason is standard market practice.
- In Illinois, the IL Pro-Buyer form includes a full financing contingency (Section 3.04), which is aggressive and unusual for institutional deals but shows the outer bound of buyer protection.

## 5. Additional Deposits

### Preferred Position
If the deal structure requires an additional deposit at DD expiration, the buyer should negotiate the following:

> "Within one (1) Business Day after Buyer's delivery of the Buyer Approval Notice, Buyer shall deposit with Escrow Agent an additional amount equal to $[AMOUNT] (the 'Additional Deposit'). The Additional Deposit, together with the Initial Deposit and all interest thereon, shall constitute the 'Earnest Money Deposit' or 'Deposit' for all purposes under this Agreement."

The additional deposit should be triggered only by buyer's affirmative delivery of the Buyer Approval Notice, not by deemed approval or expiration of the DD period.

The UNICO Buyer form also provides an additional deposit mechanism tied to the closing extension option (Section 11.2.2): if buyer exercises a 20-business-day closing extension, buyer must deposit "an amount equal to 50% of the original Earnest Money Deposit." This additional amount becomes part of the Earnest Money Deposit.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Ensure the additional deposit is triggered only by buyer's affirmative action (delivery of Approval Notice), not by passive expiration of the DD period.
- The additional deposit should have the same refund carve-outs as the initial deposit post-DD.
- If the additional deposit is tied to a closing extension, ensure the amount is reasonable (the 50% of original deposit in the UNICO form is at the high end).
- The Seller Income Property form provides for the additional deposit to be "nonrefundable, except in case of Seller's default...and as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement." Ensure the "otherwise expressly provided" cross-references are comprehensive.
- Resist seller's attempt to require the additional deposit to be paid directly to seller rather than into escrow. The Seller Income Property form included this as a bracketed option: "[Upon receipt, Escrow Holder shall promptly pay the Additional Deposit to Seller.]" This is unacceptable.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Seller wants a large additional deposit (e.g., doubling the initial deposit).** Fallback: Accept an additional deposit equal to the initial deposit (so total is 2x initial) but only if post-DD refund carve-outs are preserved. Tradeoff: More capital at risk but same contractual protections.
2. **Seller wants the additional deposit on deemed approval.** Fallback: Accept this only with a 2-business-day funding window after the deemed approval date. Tradeoff: Creates a brief window where buyer has constructive approval but has not yet funded, which may give leverage if buyer wants to terminate.

### Risk Assessment
**HIGH** -- Additional deposits increase the total capital at risk. The timing and trigger for the additional deposit directly affect buyer's optionality.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Generally uniform across asset types. The total deposit amount (initial plus additional) tends to be higher in competitive markets and for trophy assets.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant jurisdictional variations for the additional deposit mechanism itself. Transfer tax implications of deposit forfeiture may vary by jurisdiction.

---

## 6. Interest on Deposits

### Preferred Position
All interest earned on the earnest money deposit should accrue to the benefit of buyer, whether the deal closes or terminates. At closing, interest should be credited against the purchase price. Sample language from the UNICO Buyer form:

> "The Earnest Money Deposit shall be held in an interest-bearing account provided that both parties execute any authorizations required by Escrow Agent to invest the funds. All interest earned on the Earnest Money Deposit while in escrow shall become part of the Earnest Money Deposit and paid to the party entitled to the Earnest Money Deposit."

The ASB Hardware Block form (seller side) provides: "All interest earned on the Deposit shall be deemed to be part of the Deposit and shall accrue to the benefit of Purchaser except to the extent the Deposit becomes payable to Seller pursuant to Section 10.2. In such event the interest earned on the Deposit shall accrue to the benefit of the Seller."

The IL Pro-Buyer form provides that "at the Closing any interest earned on the Earnest Money Deposit shall be credited to Purchaser by applying the same against the Purchase Price."

### Key Negotiation Points
- Interest should follow the deposit: if buyer gets the deposit back, buyer gets the interest. If seller retains the deposit as liquidated damages, seller gets the interest. This is the majority approach and is fair.
- Buyer should have input on the investment vehicle. The ASB form allows Purchaser to select or approve the account. The UNICO form requires both parties to authorize.
- In the current interest rate environment, interest on multi-million-dollar deposits held for 30-90 days is not insignificant. Ensure the account is interest-bearing, not a non-interest demand account.
- Request that the Escrow Agent invest in a money market account, short-term treasuries, or other liquid instruments. Avoid CDs with early withdrawal penalties that could delay deposit return.
- The Meadows form specified: "The Deposit shall be held by the Title Company in an interest-bearing account designated in writing by Buyer and approved in writing by Seller." This is optimal for buyer -- buyer designates, seller approves.
- Ensure tax reporting obligations are addressed. The party earning the interest is responsible for tax reporting. The UNICO forms designate the Escrow Agent as the IRS Reporting Person under Section 6045(e).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Seller wants interest to follow the deposit in all scenarios (including forfeiture).** This is actually the standard approach and acceptable. Tradeoff: None -- this is market.
2. **Seller wants interest paid to seller even if deposit is returned to buyer.** Resist firmly. Tradeoff: There is no legitimate justification for this position.

### Risk Assessment
**LOW** -- Interest allocation is rarely a deal-breaker, but the dollars can be meaningful on large deposits held for extended periods.

### Asset-Type Variations
None -- uniform across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Some states (e.g., New York) have specific rules about attorney escrow accounts and the investment of client funds that may limit investment options.
- In states with IOLTA requirements, deposits held by attorneys must be placed in IOLTA accounts unless the amount and duration justify a separate interest-bearing account.

## 7. Escrow Agent Selection and Duties

### Preferred Position
The buyer should have the right to select the escrow agent, or at minimum have approval rights. The escrow agent should be the same entity as the title company issuing the owner's title policy. This consolidates the closing process and reduces coordination costs. The UNICO forms separate the roles (Section 1.11 for Escrow Agent, Section 1.12 for Title Company), which allows flexibility but adds complexity.

Key escrow agent duties:
- Hold the deposit in an interest-bearing account selected or approved by buyer.
- Disburse the deposit only upon joint written instructions from both parties, or upon a final court order.
- Act as IRS Reporting Person under Section 6045(e) of the Code.
- Not disburse the deposit based on one party's unilateral instruction (with limited exceptions for termination rights clearly triggered by the agreement).

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Joint instruction requirement:** Insist that the escrow agent may not release the deposit to either party without either (a) joint written instructions from both parties, or (b) a final court order. Single-party instruction provisions (as in the IL Pro-Buyer form's "Noticing Party" mechanism) can lead to premature release.
- **Interpleader right:** The escrow agent should have the right to interplead the deposit if there is a dispute. This is standard and protects all parties. The ASB form (Section 11.21(d)) provides: "Escrow Agent may hold the Deposit until the receipt of written instructions from both Purchaser and Seller or a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction."
- **Indemnification:** Both parties should jointly and severally indemnify the escrow agent for losses arising from its role, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct. This is standard and protects against escrow agent refusal to serve.
- **Escrow agent liability standard:** Escrow agent should have no liability except for willful misconduct or gross negligence. The UNICO forms use this standard. The ASB form adds that the escrow agent is "not responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for the sufficiency, correctness, genuineness or validity of any written instrument."
- **Escrow agent's execution of the PSA:** Best practice is to have the escrow agent execute the PSA (or a joinder) to acknowledge its obligations. The UNICO Seller form includes this: "The Escrow Agent is executing this Agreement to evidence its agreement to hold the Earnest Money Deposit and act as 'Escrow Agent.'"

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Seller insists on its own preferred escrow agent.** Fallback: Acceptable if the escrow agent is a reputable national title company. Resist if seller proposes its own counsel as escrow agent. Tradeoff: Minimal, as long as the escrow provisions are robust.
2. **Seller proposes single-party release mechanism (e.g., notice and 5-day objection period).** Fallback: Accept but extend the objection period to at least 10 business days and require that the noticing party's notice specify the contractual provision entitling it to the deposit. The IL Pro-Buyer form uses this approach. Tradeoff: Creates risk of premature release but the objection mechanism provides a safeguard.
3. **Escrow agent refuses to execute the PSA.** Fallback: Require a separate escrow agreement that incorporates the deposit provisions of the PSA by reference.

### Risk Assessment
**MEDIUM** -- Escrow agent selection and duties are important procedural protections. The primary risk is a disputed deposit being released to the wrong party based on inadequate escrow procedures.

### Asset-Type Variations
None -- uniform across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** It is customary for the seller's attorney to hold the deposit in escrow. Buyers should insist on a detailed escrow agreement with joint-instruction requirements and should consider requiring the seller's attorney to have fidelity/errors and omissions insurance.
- **California:** Title companies routinely serve as escrow agents and follow standardized escrow instructions.
- **Illinois:** The IL Pro-Buyer form includes a detailed standalone escrow article (Article V) with a notice-and-objection mechanism that is more procedurally complex than the typical Western-state approach.
- **Colorado/Oregon/Washington:** Title companies serve as both escrow agent and title insurer, which is efficient.

## 8. Payment of Purchase Price at Closing (Wire Transfer Mechanics)

### Preferred Position
The purchase price should be paid at closing by federal wire transfer of immediately available funds, with the earnest money deposit credited against the purchase price. The buyer should have control over the timing and mechanics of the wire to protect against wire fraud. Sample language (synthesized from the UNICO Buyer and ASB forms):

> "At Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller the Purchase Price as follows:
> (a) The Earnest Money Deposit shall be credited against the Purchase Price and shall be released by Escrow Agent to Seller upon Closing.
> [If applicable: (b) The then-outstanding principal amount of the Existing Loan being assumed by Buyer at Closing shall be credited against the Purchase Price.]
> (c) Buyer shall pay Seller the balance of the Purchase Price (subject to the adjustments, apportionments and credits as provided for herein) in immediately available funds at Closing."

### Key Negotiation Points
- Specify that wire transfer instructions must be provided by seller in advance of closing (at least 2-3 business days) and confirmed by telephone to a verified number. Wire fraud is a significant and growing risk in real estate transactions.
- The closing mechanics should require that the escrow agent not disburse funds until (a) the deed has been recorded (or irrevocably committed for recording), and (b) the title company is committed to issue the title policy. The UNICO Buyer form (Section 11.3) provides: "Provided that all funds and documents required...have been deposited into escrow...Escrow Agent shall (i) cause the Deed to be recorded, (ii) pay to Seller by Federal Reserve wire transfer of immediately available funds."
- Establish a "Deposit Deadline" -- a cutoff time on the closing date by which all funds and documents must be in escrow. The UNICO form uses "3:00 pm [LOCAL TIME] on the Closing Date."
- Ensure buyer receives a credit at closing for all security deposits (cash and letter-of-credit transfers), prepaid rents, and prorations favoring buyer.
- Require the escrow agent to prepare a preliminary closing statement at least 5 business days before closing and a final closing statement at least 2 business days before closing (per the UNICO forms, Section 11.8).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Seller wants funds wired directly to seller (not through escrow).** Resist firmly. All funds should flow through the escrow agent for the protection of both parties. Tradeoff: None -- this is a fundamental closing protection.
2. **Seller wants to pre-close (fund before recording).** Fallback: Acceptable in jurisdictions where this is standard practice, but only if (a) the title company provides a "gap" indemnity, and (b) the escrow agreement prohibits disbursement until recording confirmation or commitment to record. Tradeoff: Standard in some jurisdictions; the gap indemnity provides adequate protection.
3. **Disagreement on closing statement.** The UNICO form provides that if the parties cannot agree on the closing statement at least 2 business days before closing, either party may extend the closing date until 2 business days after agreement is reached. This is a reasonable buyer protection.

### Risk Assessment
**HIGH** -- Wire transfer mechanics are critical for closing execution. Wire fraud, misdirected funds, and timing failures can derail closings and create massive liability exposure.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Portfolio deals:** May require separate closing statements and wire instructions for each property if separate entities are involved on the seller side.
- **Data Center:** Additional closing mechanics may be required for the transfer of fiber/connectivity contracts and utility account deposits.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York (sit-down closing):** Funds are typically wired to the seller's attorney's escrow account and disbursed at the closing table. The NY Checklist identifies the closing location as typically "the seller's attorney's office" or "the purchaser's lender's attorney's office."
- **Western states (escrow closing):** Funds are wired to the escrow agent/title company, which handles all disbursements after recording.
- **Recording mechanics vary:** Some jurisdictions allow same-day recording; others require next-day recording, which affects gap risk and the timing of fund disbursement.

## 9. Purchase Price Allocation (Personal Property vs. Real Property)

### Preferred Position
The buyer should negotiate a meaningful allocation of the purchase price to personal property, tangible and intangible, to the extent supportable by fair market value. Personal property is eligible for shorter depreciation schedules (5 or 7 years under MACRS vs. 39 years for commercial real property). This allocation has significant tax benefits for the buyer.

The Seller Income Property form includes: "The sum of $[AMOUNT] of the Purchase Price shall be allocated to the Personal Property, and the balance shall be allocated to the Real Property, the Appurtenances and the Improvements." This is a clean approach that buyer should seek to include.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Include an explicit allocation provision in the PSA. Many forms (including the UNICO forms) do not include one, which leaves the allocation to post-closing negotiation or unilateral determination.
- The allocation must be supportable by a cost segregation study or appraisal. An unsupported allocation will not withstand IRS scrutiny.
- Both parties should agree to report consistently on their respective tax returns (IRS Form 8594 may not apply to real property sales, but the principle of consistency applies).
- For data centers and industrial properties with significant equipment, the personal property allocation can be substantial and is worth fighting for.
- Watch for "anti-allocation" provisions in seller forms that prohibit or limit buyer's ability to allocate value to personal property. Seller's concern is that an allocation to personal property may trigger sales tax in some jurisdictions.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Seller refuses to agree to an allocation.** Fallback: Include a provision that buyer may make a reasonable allocation, supported by an independent appraisal, and seller will not take an inconsistent position. Tradeoff: Less binding than a joint allocation but preserves buyer's tax position.
2. **Seller proposes a nominal allocation to personal property.** Fallback: Insist on a fair market value allocation supported by a cost segregation study. Offer to share the cost of the study. Tradeoff: More negotiation effort but significant tax benefit.
3. **Seller raises sales tax concern.** Fallback: Buyer bears any incremental sales tax resulting from the personal property allocation. Tradeoff: Sales tax cost may partially offset depreciation benefit, but typically the NPV of accelerated depreciation exceeds the one-time sales tax.

### Risk Assessment
**MEDIUM** -- The tax benefit of a favorable allocation can be substantial (hundreds of thousands of dollars on a $50M+ deal), but the issue is rarely a deal-breaker.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Data Center:** Highest potential for personal property allocation (generators, UPS systems, cooling infrastructure, cabling, racks). Can represent 20-40% of purchase price.
- **Industrial:** Moderate potential (dock equipment, cranes, specialized HVAC). Typically 5-15%.
- **Office:** Lower potential (FF&E, lobby fixtures, access control systems). Typically 3-8%.
- **Retail:** Limited potential unless the sale includes restaurant equipment or specialized fixtures.
- **Multifamily:** Appliances, fitness equipment, common area furnishings. Typically 5-10%.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Some states impose sales tax on the transfer of personal property (e.g., Washington, Texas). The allocation may increase the buyer's transfer cost.
- Some jurisdictions assess personal property tax on tangible personal property, which is an ongoing cost that offsets the depreciation benefit.
- IRS cost segregation rules apply regardless of jurisdiction. Section 1245 and Section 1250 recapture rules will apply on a future disposition.

## 10. Existing Loan Assumption Mechanics

### Preferred Position
If the buyer is assuming seller's existing financing, this should be structured as a condition precedent to both parties' obligations to close. The UNICO forms (both buyer and seller side) include comprehensive optional loan assumption provisions that represent best-in-class drafting:

> "Buyer agrees to acquire the Property only if it may pay a portion of the Purchase Price by assuming all outstanding indebtedness under the existing loan ('Existing Loan')... Therefore, it shall be a condition precedent to the obligation to close for both Seller and Buyer that Seller and Buyer shall have received an Existing Loan Assumption Approval."

Key elements of the buyer's preferred structure:
1. **Mutual condition precedent:** Assumption approval is a condition for both parties, not just buyer.
2. **Buyer controls the process but seller cooperates:** Buyer applies for assumption approval, with seller's assistance and cooperation.
3. **Cost allocation favoring buyer:** Lender's legal fees and assumption fees should be allocated by negotiation (the UNICO form leaves this blank: "[____] shall pay any legal fees of Existing Lender").
4. **Release of seller's guarantors:** Buyer should insist that the assumption documents provide for the release of seller and its key principals from all further liability under the existing loan arising after closing.
5. **Termination right if approval not obtained:** If the parties cannot obtain assumption approval despite good faith efforts, the agreement terminates and the deposit is returned in full.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Existing Loan Assumption Approval defined:** Per the UNICO form, approval means the lender has (a) approved the assignment in writing, (b) agreed on assumption document forms, (c) executed and delivered assumption documents, and (d) all conditions (other than buyer performance) have been satisfied. This is a comprehensive definition that protects buyer.
- **Reasonable efforts standard:** Both parties should use "reasonable, diligent and good faith efforts" to obtain assumption approval. Avoid "best efforts" which may impose a higher standard.
- **Buyer's approval of assumption documents:** Buyer must have the right to approve the assumption documents as "reasonably acceptable to Buyer." Watch for lender requirements that modify the existing loan terms unfavorably (increased reserves, rate adjustments, prepayment penalty modifications).
- **Closing date extension:** If assumption approval is not obtained by the scheduled closing date, the closing date should automatically extend to accommodate the lender's process (within reason). The UNICO form provides for this in multiple sections.
- **Termination trigger:** Per the UNICO form (Section 2.6.7): "If despite the parties' reasonable, diligent and good faith efforts, the parties are unable to obtain the Existing Loan Assumption Approval at least [X] Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, this Agreement shall terminate and the Earnest Money Deposit shall be promptly returned to Buyer." The buyer should negotiate for a reasonable lead time (at least 5-10 business days before closing) to ensure the approval is obtained with sufficient time to prepare for closing.
- **Credit against purchase price:** The outstanding loan balance at closing should be credited against the purchase price. The UNICO form provides: "The then-outstanding principal amount of the Existing Loan...being assumed by Buyer at Closing...shall be credited against the Purchase Price."
- **Title objection carve-out:** Buyer should not be entitled to object to the existing loan as a title exception, so long as the assumption approval is being processed. The UNICO Buyer form includes this: "Buyer shall not be entitled to object to the Existing Loan so long as the Existing Lender has given or is in the process of giving an Existing Loan Assumption Approval."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Seller wants buyer to bear all assumption costs.** Fallback: Agree to bear the lender's assumption fee and lender's counsel fees, but each party pays its own legal fees. Tradeoff: Assumption fees are typically 0.5-1% of the loan balance, which is significant but usually less than origination costs for new financing.
2. **Seller wants a one-way condition (only buyer's obligation is conditioned on assumption).** Fallback: Accept if seller represents that it has confirmed the loan is assumable and there are no material defaults. Tradeoff: Seller may try to close even if assumption approval is not obtained, which is unworkable.
3. **Seller resists guarantor release.** Fallback: This is essential. If the lender will not release seller's guarantors, seller should not be forced to close (and buyer likely cannot close either, since the lender will require replacement guarantors). Tradeoff: If buyer's replacement guarantors are not acceptable to lender, this becomes a mutual termination event.
4. **Seller wants to limit closing date extensions for assumption processing.** Fallback: Accept a reasonable outside date (e.g., 60-90 days after the original closing date) beyond which either party may terminate. Tradeoff: Provides certainty of timeline but may not be sufficient if the lender is slow.

### Risk Assessment
**CRITICAL** -- Loan assumption deals add enormous complexity and risk. The buyer is dependent on a third party (the lender) whose approval timeline and requirements are outside the buyer's control. Failure to properly structure the assumption contingency can result in the buyer being forced to close without financing or forfeiting its deposit.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily (agency debt):** Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans are generally assumable with lender approval. The process is well-established but can take 60-90 days. Agency lenders have specific requirements for replacement guarantors/key principals.
- **Office/Retail (CMBS):** CMBS loan assumptions require servicer approval and can take 90-120 days. The assumption fee is typically 1% of the outstanding loan balance. Buyer should negotiate for adequate time and ensure the PSA contemplates the CMBS servicing process.
- **Industrial:** Life company and bank loans may have different assumption provisions. Some prohibit assumption entirely.
- **Data Center:** Specialized lenders may have unique assumption requirements related to tenant credit quality and power/cooling infrastructure.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** The NY Checklist specifically addresses mortgage assignment (not assumption) as a mechanism to save mortgage recording tax (MRT). The MRT savings can be substantial (2.8% of the mortgage amount for properties in NYC). Negotiate the right to assign the seller's existing mortgage rather than assuming the underlying loan obligation.
- **Transfer tax implications:** In some jurisdictions, a loan assumption reduces the consideration subject to transfer tax because only the equity portion is "new" consideration.
- **Due-on-sale provisions:** Under the Garn-St Germain Act, certain transfers may be exempt from due-on-sale clauses, but commercial loans are generally not exempt.

## 11. Purchase Price Adjustments and Prorations

### Preferred Position
All prorations should be calculated as of 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the closing date, with buyer deemed the owner for the entire closing day. This is the approach in both UNICO forms. The following items should be prorated and credited against the purchase price:

1. **Real estate taxes and assessments** -- based on the most recent tax bill, with a post-closing true-up when the actual bill is issued.
2. **Rents and other income** -- based on amounts actually collected (not billed). Buyer should not credit seller for uncollected rents; instead, buyer should have a post-closing obligation to bill delinquent tenants and remit seller's share.
3. **Operating expense reimbursements (CAM, insurance, tax pass-throughs)** -- prorated based on actual expenses through the proration date vs. estimated payments received from tenants.
4. **Security deposits** -- credited in full to buyer at closing (cash deposits). Letters of credit should be transferred or reissued.
5. **Prepaid rents** -- credited in full to buyer at closing.
6. **Utility deposits** -- seller receives credit for any utility deposits transferred to buyer.
7. **Assumed contract fees** -- prorated.
8. **Outstanding leasing costs** -- credited to buyer per Section 1 above.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Proration date:** Buyer wants prorations calculated as of 11:59 p.m. on the day before closing, with buyer owning the entire closing day. This maximizes the number of days in buyer's period for rent collections and minimizes the number of days in seller's period for expense accruals. Both UNICO forms use this approach.
- **Post-closing reconciliation period:** The UNICO forms provide 90 days for post-closing true-ups. Buyer should negotiate for at least 90 days (preferably 120 days) and ensure the provision includes mutual access to books and records.
- **Delinquent rents:** The UNICO Buyer form provides a reasonable waterfall: (a) first to the month of closing, (b) then to buyer's period, (c) then to seller's period. This protects buyer against having to remit collections to seller before buyer's own arrearages are covered.
- **Tax appeal proceedings:** If seller has pending tax appeals, the buyer should receive the benefit of any refunds for periods after closing, and seller should have the right to pursue refunds for prior periods. The ASB form (Section 6.6(d)) provides detailed mechanics for this.
- **Annual reconciliation statements:** Ensure seller is responsible for preparing and delivering annual reconciliation statements for the year of closing (or the prior year if not yet delivered). The UNICO Buyer form (Section 7.7) assigns this responsibility to seller.
- **Closing statement preparation:** The preliminary closing statement should be prepared at least 5 business days before closing and finalized at least 2 business days before closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Seller wants a shorter post-closing true-up period (e.g., 30 days).** Fallback: Accept 60 days as a compromise but require seller to cooperate in providing information needed for the true-up. Tradeoff: Shorter period increases risk that buyer cannot complete reconciliation, but 60 days is usually sufficient.
2. **Seller wants rents prorated on accrual basis (billed, not collected).** Fallback: This is strongly disfavored for buyer because buyer would be crediting seller for rents that tenants have not actually paid. Accept only if seller provides a representation that all billed rents are current and there are no material delinquencies. Tradeoff: Creates collection risk for buyer.
3. **Seller resists the delinquent rent waterfall.** Fallback: Accept a waterfall that credits the month of closing first, then allocates remaining collections chronologically. Tradeoff: Less favorable than the buyer-first approach but still reasonable.

### Risk Assessment
**HIGH** -- Proration disputes are one of the most common sources of post-closing disagreements. On large properties with multiple tenants, the proration amounts can be significant. A poorly drafted proration provision can result in hundreds of thousands of dollars of unresolvable disputes.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office/Retail:** Complex prorations due to CAM reconciliations, percentage rent calculations, and tenant reimbursement structures. Require detailed reconciliation provisions.
- **Industrial (NNN):** Simpler prorations because tenants typically pay taxes and operating expenses directly. Focus on confirming tenants are current on reimbursements.
- **Multifamily:** Prepaid rents and concession burn-off are key proration issues. Utility sub-metering arrangements may complicate expense prorations.
- **Data Center:** Power costs are a major expense item. Ensure the proration provision addresses power cost pass-throughs and any power purchase agreements.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Real estate tax proration timing** varies by jurisdiction. In some states, taxes are assessed in arrears (e.g., Illinois, New Jersey), which means the buyer is paying for seller's period of ownership. In others, taxes are assessed in advance. The proration provision must account for the local tax cycle.
- **Transfer tax treatment** of prorations varies. In some jurisdictions, credits to buyer at closing may reduce or increase the consideration subject to transfer tax.
- **New York:** Real estate taxes in NYC are paid quarterly in advance. Ensure the proration accounts for any prepaid amounts.

## 12. Closing Date Extension Mechanics

### Preferred Position
The buyer should have at least one unilateral right to extend the closing date, with a reciprocal right for seller. The UNICO Buyer form provides two extension mechanisms:

1. **Mutual one-business-day extension** (Section 11.2.1): Either party may extend one time by 1 business day, with a $5,000 payment to the other party credited at closing. This is a practical accommodation for minor administrative delays.
2. **Buyer's additional extension option** (Section 11.2.2): Buyer may extend one time for up to 20 business days by depositing an additional amount equal to 50% of the original deposit. This addresses situations where buyer needs additional time to close (e.g., lender processing delays, title issues).

Additionally, the Seller Income Property form includes a closing extension tied to an "Extension Fee" paid to seller, which may or may not be credited against the purchase price. The buyer should negotiate for full credit.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Negotiate for at least one 15-20 business day extension right without conditions (or with the only condition being an additional deposit).
- Ensure any extension fee is credited against the purchase price, not treated as additional non-refundable consideration.
- Resist seller's attempts to make the closing date "time of the essence" without an extension right. As the NY Checklist notes: "The purchaser typically does not want to agree to a time of the essence closing date."
- Automatic extensions should be built in for specific events: failure to agree on the closing statement, title cure periods, estoppel delivery delays, and loan assumption processing.
- The closing statement extension in the UNICO form (Section 11.8) is an important buyer protection: if the parties cannot agree on the closing statement 2 business days before closing, either party may extend until 2 business days after agreement is reached.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Seller refuses any extension right.** Fallback: Accept a "time of the essence" closing date but only if (a) the closing date is at least 45-60 days after the DD expiration, and (b) automatic extensions are included for title cure, estoppel delays, and closing statement disputes. Tradeoff: Less flexibility but adequate protection for foreseeable delays.
2. **Seller demands a large extension fee.** Fallback: Accept a per-diem fee equal to seller's carrying costs (debt service, insurance, taxes) during the extension period, credited in full against the purchase price. Tradeoff: Economically neutral if credited against purchase price.

### Risk Assessment
**HIGH** -- Inability to extend the closing date when needed can result in a technical buyer default and forfeiture of the deposit. This is particularly critical in loan assumption transactions where the lender's timeline is outside buyer's control.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Generally uniform, though longer closing periods (and more extension rights) are typical for data center and development transactions.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** "Time of the essence" closing dates have specific legal significance. A party seeking to make time of the essence must typically provide reasonable prior notice (usually 30 days). Inadvertent agreement to a time-of-the-essence date can have severe consequences.
- In most Western states, time is not "of the essence" unless expressly stated. The Meadows form (Oregon) includes a general "Time is of the Essence" provision (Section 9.10).

## 13. Liquidated Damages and Deposit Forfeiture

### Preferred Position
From the buyer's perspective, the deposit-as-liquidated-damages provision protects buyer by capping seller's remedy in the event of a buyer default. The buyer's preferred structure:

1. **Seller's sole remedy for buyer default is retention of the deposit as liquidated damages.** No specific performance against buyer. No additional damages claim.
2. **Mutual waiver of consequential damages.**
3. **Buyer's remedy for seller default is specific performance AND/OR return of deposit plus breakage costs.** The UNICO Buyer form (Section 13.1) provides the strongest buyer protection:

> "If the sale of the Property is not consummated due to a default by Seller...Buyer shall be entitled, as its sole remedy, to either (a) enforce specific performance of this Agreement and to recover from Seller any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Buyer in connection with such enforcement action, plus to the extent the default or breach by Seller was intentional or willful, recover any and all damages arising out of such intentional or willful default, or (b) terminate this Agreement and receive back the Earnest Money Deposit and to recover from Seller an amount to compensate Buyer for costs incurred in connection with this Agreement...in an amount up to the Earnest Money Deposit ('Seller Breakage Fee')."

### Key Negotiation Points
- Ensure the liquidated damages provision requires initialing by both parties. This is standard practice (see the Meadows form: "SELLER'S INITIALS:_____ BUYER'S INITIALS:_____") and helps establish enforceability.
- The liquidated damages amount should be limited to the deposit -- no additional exposure for buyer beyond the deposit.
- Buyer should retain specific performance rights against seller. Many seller forms try to limit buyer's remedy to return of the deposit. The UNICO Buyer form preserves specific performance plus breakage costs, which is the preferred position.
- The "Seller Breakage Fee" concept (UNICO Buyer form) is an important buyer protection: if seller defaults and buyer elects to terminate (rather than sue for specific performance), buyer recovers its deposit PLUS its actual costs up to the deposit amount. This compensates buyer for the real economic harm of a failed transaction.
- Watch for seller forms that impose a deadline for buyer to file suit for specific performance. The UNICO Seller form requires buyer to "file suit for specific performance against Seller in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or before the date which is [X] days following the date upon which Closing was to have occurred" or the specific performance remedy is waived. If this provision is included, negotiate for at least 90 days (the Meadows form appears to use a shorter period).
- Buyer should waive any right to record a lis pendens only if buyer is also receiving the Seller Breakage Fee. The Meadows form includes such a waiver: "Buyer waives any right to record a lis pendens on the Property." This is an aggressive seller protection that buyer should resist unless compensated.
- Require 5 business day notice and cure periods before default remedies are triggered. Both UNICO forms include this protection.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Seller wants to limit buyer's remedy to return of deposit only (no specific performance, no breakage fee).** Fallback: Accept return of deposit as sole remedy only if (a) seller provides an indemnity for buyer's actual third-party costs (DD costs, legal fees) up to a cap, and (b) the deposit is returned promptly (within 5 business days of termination). Tradeoff: Buyer loses the ability to force the deal but is compensated for costs.
2. **Seller wants both specific performance AND damages for buyer default.** Resist firmly. Buyer's exposure should be limited to the deposit. This is the universal standard in institutional transactions. Tradeoff: None -- this is a fundamental buyer protection.
3. **Seller proposes a short deadline for specific performance filing (e.g., 30 days).** Fallback: Negotiate for 60-90 days. Tradeoff: A shorter deadline may result in buyer losing the specific performance remedy due to the practical difficulties of commencing litigation quickly.

### Risk Assessment
**CRITICAL** -- The default and remedies provisions define the parties' ultimate exposure. The deposit-as-liquidated-damages structure is essential for buyer because it caps buyer's downside at a known, negotiated amount. Any deviation from this structure creates potentially unlimited exposure.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Generally uniform across asset types. The specific performance remedy is more valuable for unique assets (trophy office buildings, data centers with specialized infrastructure) where substitute transactions are difficult to find.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **California:** Civil Code Section 1671 governs liquidated damages provisions. The amount must be reasonable at the time of contracting and the actual damages must be difficult to ascertain. Deposits of 3-5% of purchase price are generally upheld.
- **New York:** Liquidated damages provisions are enforceable if the amount is a reasonable forecast of probable harm and actual damages are difficult to determine. New York courts may decline to enforce provisions that are clearly disproportionate.
- **Texas:** Liquidated damages provisions must represent a reasonable estimate of damages. Texas courts look at the relationship between the liquidated amount and the actual or anticipated loss.
- **Illinois:** The IL Pro-Buyer form includes a robust seller default remedy that provides for specific performance, return of deposit, and reimbursement of "Purchaser's Costs" (defined to include DD costs, title costs, engineering fees, and legal fees).
- **Oregon:** The Meadows form (Oregon) includes the required liquidated damages initialing provision and limits buyer's exposure to the deposit.
