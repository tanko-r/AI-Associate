# Casualty and Condemnation (Risk of Loss) — Buyer Playbook

This playbook addresses the Casualty and Condemnation (Risk of Loss) provisions of a commercial real estate purchase and sale agreement from the **buyer/purchaser** perspective. It is designed for use by AI agents conducting contract review on behalf of institutional buyers acquiring income-producing commercial real estate ($50M+ transactions).

## Risk of Loss Allocation (Pre-Closing Responsibility)

### Preferred Position

Risk of loss should remain with Seller at all times prior to Closing. The PSA should expressly state that Seller bears the risk of loss for any casualty, damage, destruction, or condemnation event affecting the Property from the Effective Date through the Closing Date. The buyer's objective is to ensure it never takes title to damaged or diminished property without full compensation or the right to walk away.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Risk of loss for damage or destruction of all or any portion of the Property, or condemnation or threatened condemnation of all or any portion of the Property, shall remain with Seller at all times prior to and including the Closing Date. The provisions of the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act (or equivalent state statute) and any similar laws shall not apply to this Agreement and are hereby waived."

The buyer must ensure the PSA expressly displaces the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act (UVPRA) or its state-law equivalent. Under the UVPRA (adopted in roughly a dozen states), risk of loss shifts to the buyer once the buyer takes possession or legal title — but equitable conversion doctrines in some jurisdictions can shift risk even earlier. The PSA must override these default rules.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Require an express statement that Seller bears risk of loss from Effective Date through Closing.
- Expressly waive the UVPRA and any state equitable conversion doctrine. The UNICO Buyer Side form at Section 12 and the Detailed Seller Side form at Section 6.3 both address risk of loss, but neither expressly waives UVPRA — the buyer should insist on this waiver.
- Confirm that Seller's obligation to maintain insurance (see the Seller (Income Property) form at Section 7(d): "Seller shall maintain all casualty and liability insurance currently in force with respect to the Property") runs through Closing, not merely through the end of diligence.
- Ensure the risk of loss provision covers all types of casualty (fire, flood, wind, earthquake, terrorism, pandemic-related damage) and all forms of governmental taking (eminent domain, inverse condemnation, regulatory taking).
- The provision should cover both the physical Property and the income stream (i.e., business interruption and rent loss).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Equitable conversion means the buyer holds equitable title after contract execution, and risk should shift to buyer accordingly. Seller may also argue that since buyer controls insurance decisions post-closing anyway, buyer should arrange its own coverage.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept that risk of loss shifts to buyer only upon actual delivery of the deed and payment of the purchase price (i.e., Closing), regardless of when equitable title vests — this is the market standard for institutional deals.
2. If Seller insists on a framework that does not expressly allocate risk, require (a) Seller's maintenance of insurance through Closing as a covenant, (b) full assignment of insurance proceeds upon any casualty, and (c) buyer's termination right for material events. This achieves functional equivalence.
3. As a last resort, accept UVPRA default rules only if the PSA confirms buyer has not taken "possession" prior to Closing (access for inspections does not constitute possession).

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — Failure to address risk of loss allocation can leave the buyer holding a damaged asset with no right to terminate and no claim to insurance proceeds. The default rule under the common-law doctrine of equitable conversion (still followed in a minority of jurisdictions) places risk on the buyer from the moment the contract is signed. Even in UVPRA states, the statute's application can be uncertain. Express contractual allocation is essential.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** High-rise office buildings face wind, fire, and water damage risks that can take 12-24 months to restore. Risk of loss during extended closing timelines is amplified.
- **Industrial:** Warehouse and logistics properties face roof collapse, fire (especially in properties with flammable goods), and environmental contamination risks. Buyer should confirm that environmental remediation obligations triggered by a casualty do not pass to buyer.
- **Retail:** Anchor tenant departure triggered by casualty can cascade into co-tenancy failures across the center. Buyer must tie risk of loss to tenant termination rights (see separate section below).
- **Multifamily:** Casualty affecting habitability in a portion of units may trigger local rent abatement or relocation obligations under municipal codes.
- **Data Center:** Even minor casualties (water intrusion, fire suppression discharge) can destroy millions in infrastructure. The threshold for "material" casualty should be calibrated to the extreme density of value per square foot.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Section 5-1311 of the General Obligations Law is New York's version of the UVPRA. The NY Negotiation Checklist (Purchaser) expressly recommends: "Confirm that the parties waive the provisions of Section 5-1311 of the General Obligations Law of the State of New York." This waiver must be express and mutual.
- **California:** Cal. Civ. Code Section 1662 places risk on buyer under equitable conversion absent contrary agreement. Always override by contract.
- **Illinois:** The IL Pro-Buyer form (Article XVII) contains a comprehensive casualty provision that expressly states: "the parties intend for the provisions of Section 17.01, Section 17.02, and Section 17.03 to supersede any law applicable to the Property governing the effect of fire or other casualty or condemnation in contracts for real property." This is the gold standard for UVPRA displacement.
- **Texas:** Texas follows the UVPRA (Tex. Prop. Code Section 5.007). Express contractual override is standard practice.
- **Oregon/Washington:** The Meadows and UNICO forms (both Oregon deals) do not expressly waive any risk-of-loss statute, relying instead on the contractual framework itself. Buyer should add an express waiver in Pacific Northwest transactions.

## Material vs. Immaterial Casualty Threshold

### Preferred Position

The buyer should push for the lowest possible dollar threshold to trigger the "material casualty" designation and the corresponding termination right. The threshold should be defined as a fixed dollar amount (not a percentage of purchase price) and should capture multiple dimensions of materiality: (a) cost to repair, (b) impact on gross leasable area, (c) impact on major tenants, and (d) impact on property access.

**Preferred thresholds for institutional deals ($50M+):**

- Cost to repair exceeds the lesser of (i) $500,000 or (ii) 1% of the Purchase Price; OR
- Damage affects more than 10% of the gross leasable area ("GLA"); OR
- Damage affects space leased to any Major Tenant; OR
- Damage impairs vehicular or pedestrian access to the Property; OR
- Damage triggers a tenant's right to terminate its Lease or abate rent for more than 30 days; OR
- The estimated time to restore exceeds 120 days.

**Comparison of precedent thresholds:**

| Form | Threshold | Who Determines |
|---|---|---|
| UNICO Buyer Side (Section 12) | $500,000 | "Insured cost to repair" |
| UNICO Seller Side (Section 12) | $1,000,000 | "Insured cost to repair" |
| Detailed Seller Side (Section 6.3) | $2,500,000 | "Third party contractor selected by Seller" |
| Meadows/Seller-Skewed (Section 6.3) | Not specified (blank) | "Reasonably determined by Seller" |
| Seller (Income Property) (Section 9) | $_______ (blank) | Not specified |
| IL Pro-Buyer (Section 17.01) | [__]% of Purchase Price | Expedited arbitration for disputes |

### Key Negotiation Points

- The determination of whether damage is "material" should not be made solely by Seller or Seller's contractor. The Detailed Seller Side form uses "a third party contractor selected by Seller" — buyer should require either a mutually selected contractor or each party's right to obtain its own estimate with disputes resolved by a third estimate.
- The threshold should be based on the "cost to repair or restore to substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior to the casualty" — not merely the "insured cost to repair," which may be lower if the property is underinsured.
- Include a temporal component: damage that would take longer than a specified period (90-180 days) to repair should be deemed material regardless of cost.
- Separately define materiality for access impairment — any damage or condemnation that impairs vehicular access, loading dock access, or utility service should independently trigger materiality. The UNICO forms (both sides) include access impairment as an independent trigger: "any such condemnation does not impair access to the Property."
- Account for consequential impacts: if the casualty triggers a Major Tenant's lease termination right or rent abatement right, it should be deemed material even if the physical damage is below the dollar threshold.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The threshold should be high (2-5% of purchase price or $2.5M+) because minor damage is an ordinary business risk, insurance will cover it, and the buyer gets the benefit of the insurance proceeds anyway.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept a higher dollar threshold ($1M-$1.5M for a $50M+ deal) but retain the alternative triggers for access impairment, Major Tenant impact, and restoration timeline.
2. Accept Seller's higher dollar threshold if the determination method is neutral (mutually selected engineer or contractor, not Seller's unilateral selection).
3. Accept a percentage-based threshold (e.g., 2% of Purchase Price) if (a) it is measured against estimated cost to fully restore (not insured value), (b) alternative triggers for access/tenant impact are retained, and (c) buyer gets the benefit of the doubt on close cases through a "reasonably estimated" standard.
4. If forced to accept Seller's high threshold, ensure the immaterial casualty provisions are robust: full credit for all insurance proceeds, deductible credit, and assignment of claims for uncollected proceeds.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — The materiality threshold is the gating mechanism for the buyer's termination right. A threshold that is too high forces the buyer to close on a damaged asset and rely solely on insurance proceeds, which may be inadequate, delayed, or subject to coverage disputes. The cost-to-repair estimate at the time of the casualty is inherently uncertain and prone to escalation.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Class A office buildings have high per-square-foot improvement values. A $2.5M threshold on a $100M office building may seem reasonable as a percentage but could represent major structural damage to a single floor. Consider adding a GLA trigger (damage to more than one full floor).
- **Industrial:** Warehouse restoration costs are typically lower per square foot, so a fixed dollar threshold may be relatively more generous. However, roof damage in industrial properties can compromise the entire tenant operation (cold storage, clean rooms). Add a trigger for damage that renders the premises unusable for the tenant's permitted use.
- **Retail:** Co-tenancy provisions in retail leases mean that damage to one anchor can trigger termination or rent reduction rights across multiple tenants. The threshold should capture cascading economic harm, not just physical damage to the structure.
- **Multifamily:** Unit-count impact is a better metric than dollar amount. Damage rendering more than 10-15% of units uninhabitable for more than 30 days should be deemed material.
- **Data Center:** The materiality threshold must be extremely low relative to building square footage because the value density is so high. A $500K casualty in a data center could mean catastrophic loss of critical infrastructure (generators, UPS, cooling). Consider a threshold keyed to impact on IT load capacity (any damage reducing available IT load by more than 5%).

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** There is no statutory definition of "material casualty" in any US jurisdiction — this is entirely a negotiated contractual standard. Courts will enforce the parties' agreed threshold.
- **California:** In seismic zones, the definition of casualty should expressly include earthquake damage, and the materiality threshold should account for the fact that earthquake insurance deductibles are typically 10-15% of insured value.
- **Florida/Gulf Coast:** Hurricane damage may be widespread but take months to assess. The threshold should include a temporal trigger for situations where the full extent of damage cannot be determined within a reasonable period.

---

## Material vs. Immaterial Condemnation Threshold

### Preferred Position

The buyer should negotiate for the lowest possible threshold to trigger the "material condemnation/taking" designation. The threshold should address both the quantum of the taking and its qualitative impact on the Property's operations and value.

**Preferred materiality triggers (any one sufficient):**

- The taking results in a diminution of property value exceeding $500,000 or 1% of the Purchase Price;
- The taking affects more than 5% of the land area or 5% of GLA;
- The taking impairs vehicular or pedestrian access to the Property;
- The taking affects any parking required by code or by any Lease;
- The taking affects any portion of the Property leased to a Major Tenant;
- The taking triggers any tenant's right to terminate its Lease or abate rent; OR
- The taking affects any utility service to the Property.

**Comparison of precedent thresholds:**

| Form | Threshold | Who Determines |
|---|---|---|
| UNICO Buyer Side (Section 12) | $500,000 (cost to repair/diminution in value) | Not specified |
| UNICO Seller Side (Section 12) | $1,000,000 (cost to repair/diminution in value) | Not specified |
| Detailed Seller Side (Section 6.4) | $2,500,000 diminution in value | "Seller's reasonable judgment" |
| Meadows/Seller-Skewed (Section 6.4) | $3,000,000 decrease in value | "Reasonably determined by Buyer" |
| Seller (Income Property) (Section 9) | "Material portion" rendering property "unsuitable for Buyer's intended use" | "Reasonably determined by Buyer" |
| IL Pro-Buyer (Section 17.01) | [__]% of Purchase Price | Arbitration for disputes involving access |

### Key Negotiation Points

- The condemnation threshold should be separately defined from the casualty threshold because the impacts are qualitatively different (permanent vs. repairable, physical vs. governmental).
- Include "threatened" condemnation, not just actual filing of proceedings. The IL Pro-Buyer form covers situations where the Property "becomes the subject of any proceedings, judicial, administrative, or otherwise, with respect to a taking by eminent domain or condemnation." Buyer should push for inclusion of threatened proceedings and preliminary governmental notices.
- The determination of "material" should not be left to Seller's sole judgment. The Detailed Seller Side form uses "Seller's reasonable judgment" — buyer should negotiate for either (a) buyer's reasonable judgment, (b) mutual determination, or (c) independent appraiser.
- Note: The Meadows form (Section 6.4) actually gives the buyer the determination right: "as reasonably determined by Buyer" — this is the preferred standard.
- Access impairment should be an independent trigger regardless of dollar amount. Both UNICO forms treat access impairment as independently triggering materiality.
- Include partial takings that affect required parking. A taking of 30 parking spaces from a retail property could violate zoning requirements and trigger tenant lease terminations even though the building itself is untouched.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Condemnation materiality should be measured solely by dollar diminution in value, and the threshold should be high because minor takings (street widening, utility easements) are common and should not give buyer a free termination right.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept a higher dollar threshold ($1M-$2M) but retain the qualitative triggers for access impairment, parking impact, Major Tenant impact, and utility service.
2. Accept "mutual reasonable determination" instead of buyer's sole determination.
3. Accept Seller's dollar threshold if buyer retains a separate termination right for any taking that triggers a tenant lease termination right.
4. As a last resort, accept Seller's threshold but require that the condemnation proceeds credit at Closing be enhanced to include lost rental income and any resulting tenant concessions.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Condemnation takings are permanent — unlike casualty damage, the taken property does not return. Even a partial taking can fundamentally alter site access, parking ratios, building setbacks, and zoning compliance. The buyer needs a realistic termination right because proceeding with a diminished property at the original Purchase Price is often uneconomic, even with condemnation proceeds credited.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Takings affecting building setbacks or parking structures can trigger non-conforming use status. The threshold should include any taking that causes the Property to violate zoning or code requirements.
- **Industrial:** Truck court and dock access are critical. Any taking that reduces truck turning radius, dock count, or trailer parking below lease requirements should be deemed material.
- **Retail:** Pad sites, outparcels, and monument signage locations are frequently targets for road-widening takings. The threshold should capture any taking affecting signage visibility, ingress/egress, or pad site tenants.
- **Multifamily:** Amenity areas (pools, fitness, parking) are high-value targets for partial takings. Loss of amenities can affect market rents across the entire property.
- **Data Center:** Any taking affecting utility feeds, fiber routes, or generator fuel storage is catastrophic regardless of square footage. The threshold should include any taking affecting utility infrastructure or redundancy systems.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All states:** Condemnation is governed by state eminent domain statutes, which vary significantly in terms of notice requirements, timing, and valuation methodology. The PSA should not rely on statutory defaults.
- **New York:** NYC exercises eminent domain frequently for infrastructure projects. Buyer should be especially vigilant about pending or threatened takings and should require Seller's representation that no proceedings are pending or threatened (as in the UNICO forms at Section 5.1.9: "No condemnation proceedings relating to the Property or its access to or from public streets or utilities are pending against Seller or, to Seller's knowledge, have been threatened against Seller in writing").
- **California:** Inverse condemnation claims (where government action effectively takes property without formal proceedings) are common. The definition of "condemnation" should include inverse condemnation.
- **Texas:** Texas eminent domain reform (HB 2730) provides property owners with enhanced negotiation rights. Buyer should ensure participation rights in any condemnation proceedings.

## Buyer's Termination Right for Material Events

### Preferred Position

Buyer must have an unconditional, unilateral right to terminate the PSA upon the occurrence of any material casualty or material condemnation event, with full return of the Earnest Money Deposit and reimbursement of transaction costs.

**Preferred framework:**

1. Seller provides prompt written notice of any casualty or condemnation event (within 2 business days of learning of the event).
2. Buyer has a minimum of 15 business days (ideally 20) after receipt of Seller's notice to evaluate the event, obtain its own estimates, and make an informed election.
3. If Buyer elects to terminate, the Earnest Money Deposit is returned in full, together with accrued interest, and Buyer is reimbursed for its out-of-pocket transaction costs (diligence costs, legal fees, lender costs) up to a negotiated cap.
4. If Buyer does not affirmatively elect to terminate within the election period, Buyer is **not** deemed to have waived its termination right — instead, the election period should automatically extend until Buyer makes an affirmative election.

**Comparison of precedent election periods and deemed-waiver provisions:**

| Form | Election Period | Deemed Waiver? |
|---|---|---|
| UNICO Buyer Side (Section 12.2) | 10 Business Days | Yes — "deemed to have elected to proceed" |
| UNICO Seller Side (Section 12.2) | 10 Business Days | Yes — "deemed to have elected to proceed" |
| Detailed Seller Side (Section 6.3-6.4) | 10 days | Yes — "deemed to have elected to proceed" |
| Meadows/Seller-Skewed (Section 6.4) | 10 Business Days | Implied (no affirmative statement) |
| Seller (Income Property) (Section 9) | 10 days | Implied |
| IL Pro-Buyer (Section 17.01) | [__] days from Casualty Notification Date | Yes |

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Resist deemed-waiver provisions.** Every precedent form contains a deemed-waiver mechanism where silence equals waiver. This is dangerous for the buyer because: (a) the full extent of damage may not be assessable within 10 days, (b) insurance coverage disputes may not have surfaced, and (c) the buyer's lender may require additional time to evaluate the impact on underwriting. At minimum, push for 20 business days and require that the deemed-waiver period not commence until Seller has provided "reasonably detailed written notice" including Seller's estimate of the cost to repair, a description of the damage, and identification of all affected tenants.
- **Termination should be "clean."** Upon termination, all rights and obligations should cease (other than surviving provisions), and the deposit should be returned within 3-5 business days. The UNICO forms handle this well: "the Earnest Money Deposit shall be returned to Buyer and neither party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder except for those obligations expressly stated to survive termination."
- **Reimbursement of buyer's costs.** Push for Seller to reimburse buyer's out-of-pocket diligence and transaction costs upon termination (up to a negotiated cap). This is uncommon in the precedent forms but justified by the fact that the termination is triggered by an event within Seller's risk allocation.
- **No termination fee or penalty.** Seller should not be entitled to retain any portion of the deposit or charge a termination fee for a casualty/condemnation termination.
- **The termination right should survive the expiration of the diligence period.** All precedent forms properly provide that the casualty/condemnation termination right operates independently of the diligence contingency.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** A 10-day election period with a deemed-waiver provision is market standard. Seller needs certainty to manage the property, deal with tenants, and make decisions about restoration or resale. Cost reimbursement is not appropriate because the casualty is not Seller's "fault."

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept a 10-business-day election period (not calendar days) but require that it not commence until Seller has delivered a "complete casualty notice" that includes: (a) a description of the damage, (b) Seller's good-faith estimate of the cost to repair, (c) identification of affected tenants, (d) copies of any tenant notices exercising lease termination or rent abatement rights, and (e) confirmation of insurance coverage and applicable deductibles.
2. Accept the deemed-waiver mechanism but negotiate for a "re-opener" — if subsequent information reveals that the damage was greater than initially estimated (by more than 25%), Buyer gets a second election window.
3. Drop the cost-reimbursement request but require that the deposit refund include accrued interest and that Seller bear the escrow cancellation charges.
4. Accept a 10-calendar-day period if the Closing Date is automatically extended by at least 30 days to accommodate the election period and any subsequent insurance/proceeds assignment mechanics.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — The termination right is the buyer's primary protection against taking title to a diminished asset. The deemed-waiver mechanism makes this a "use it or lose it" right that can expire before the buyer has adequate information. The election period and notice requirements are the most practically important provisions in the entire casualty section.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Fire or water damage in a Class A high-rise may not be fully assessable within 10 days due to structural engineering analysis requirements. Push for 20 business days.
- **Industrial:** Chemical spills or contamination from a casualty may require environmental assessment before the buyer can make an informed decision. Tie the election period to completion of Phase I/Phase II updates.
- **Retail:** Tenant co-tenancy cascading effects may take weeks to analyze. The election period should not commence until the impact on all major tenant lease provisions has been assessed.
- **Multifamily:** Code compliance issues triggered by casualty (e.g., lead paint exposure, asbestos disturbance) may take additional time to evaluate.
- **Data Center:** A single UPS or generator failure can take months to replace. The buyer needs time to assess whether the facility can maintain SLA commitments to tenants during restoration.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** The NY Negotiation Checklist expressly recommends that the purchaser "negotiate for adequate time to: assess any damage or the scope of a taking; and give a termination notice to the seller."
- **All jurisdictions:** Courts will generally enforce deemed-waiver provisions as written. The buyer cannot rely on equitable arguments to extend the election period.

## Seller's Obligation to Notify

### Preferred Position

Seller must be obligated to provide prompt, detailed written notice of any casualty event, condemnation proceeding, or threatened condemnation affecting the Property. The notice obligation should be a covenant (not merely a condition) so that breach gives rise to remedies.

**Preferred notice requirements:**

1. **Timing:** Within 2 business days of Seller first learning of the event.
2. **Content of casualty notice:** (a) Description of the damage, (b) date and cause of the casualty, (c) identification of affected portions of the Property and affected tenants, (d) Seller's good-faith estimate of the cost to repair, (e) description of insurance coverage and applicable deductibles, (f) copies of any tenant communications regarding the event, and (g) identification of any tenant lease termination or rent abatement rights triggered.
3. **Content of condemnation notice:** (a) Copy of the condemnation petition, notice of taking, or governmental correspondence, (b) identification of the portion of the Property affected, (c) Seller's estimate of the diminution in value, and (d) copies of any tenant communications regarding the event.
4. **Ongoing updates:** Seller must provide updated information as it becomes available, including revised damage estimates, insurance adjuster reports, and tenant correspondence.

**Precedent comparison:**

| Form | Notice Standard | Content Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| UNICO forms (Section 12) | "Seller's notice to Buyer" (no timing specified) | None specified |
| Detailed Seller Side (Section 6.6(e)) | "Promptly give Purchaser a reasonably detailed written notice" | "Reasonably detailed" |
| Meadows (Section 6.3-6.4) | "Reasonably promptly" | None specified |
| Seller (Income Property) | "Written notice from Seller" | None specified |
| IL Pro-Buyer (Section 17.01) | "Promptly upon learning thereof" | "Written notice of any condemnation, damage or destruction" |

### Key Negotiation Points

- "Promptly" is inadequate without a specific time frame. Negotiate for "within 2 business days" or at minimum "within 5 business days."
- Require "reasonably detailed" content at minimum; ideally specify the required content items listed above.
- The buyer's election period should not commence until Seller has delivered a compliant notice. If Seller's initial notice is deficient, the election period should be tolled until a complete notice is provided.
- The notice obligation should cover "threatened" condemnation, not just pending proceedings. Seller should be required to disclose preliminary governmental contacts, feasibility studies, or legislative actions that may lead to condemnation.
- Require Seller to forward copies of all insurance adjuster reports, contractor estimates, and governmental correspondence as received.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** "Promptly" or "reasonably promptly" is sufficient — Seller cannot be expected to provide detailed cost estimates within 48 hours of a casualty.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept "promptly" for the initial notice (which can be a brief description of the event) but require a "detailed supplemental notice" within 10 business days that includes the content items listed above. The buyer's election period commences only upon receipt of the supplemental notice.
2. Accept "promptly" without a specific timeframe if (a) the notice must be "reasonably detailed" and (b) the election period is explicitly tolled if the notice is not reasonably detailed.
3. Accept the "promptly" standard as written if there is a backstop: the PSA should provide that if Buyer first learns of the event from a source other than Seller, Buyer may deliver its own notice to Seller and the election period begins upon that notice.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Inadequate notice provisions create two related risks: (1) buyer may not learn of a material event until after Closing, losing its termination right entirely; and (2) even if buyer learns of the event, the election period clock may have already started running based on Seller's deficient initial notice, leaving buyer with insufficient time to evaluate the situation.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The notice obligation is functionally identical across asset types, but the content requirements should be tailored. For retail properties, require identification of co-tenancy implications. For data centers, require identification of SLA impacts.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **No jurisdiction-specific rules govern PSA notice content.** This is entirely a contractual matter. Courts will enforce the contractual notice requirements as written.

## Insurance Assignment/Credit Mechanics

### Preferred Position

When Buyer elects to proceed to Closing after a casualty (whether material or immaterial), the buyer must receive the full economic benefit of all insurance coverage. The preferred framework provides buyer with both a credit mechanism (for proceeds already received) and an assignment mechanism (for proceeds not yet received), structured to ensure no gap in recovery.

**Preferred framework:**

1. **Proceeds already received by Seller:** Buyer receives a dollar-for-dollar credit against the Purchase Price equal to the full amount of all insurance proceeds received by Seller, **plus** the amount of any insurance deductible, **less** amounts reasonably expended by Seller for emergency repairs (barricades, temporary weatherproofing) required to prevent further damage.
2. **Proceeds not yet received:** Seller assigns to Buyer all of Seller's right, title, and interest in and to the insurance claim and proceeds, AND Buyer receives a credit at Closing equal to the insurance deductible amount. Seller must cooperate with Buyer in prosecuting the insurance claim post-Closing.
3. **Both mechanisms available simultaneously** — for partially collected claims, buyer gets a credit for the collected portion and an assignment for the balance.

**Precedent comparison:**

The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 12.1) provides the most buyer-favorable credit language among the precedents:

> "Upon the Closing, there shall be a credit against the Purchase Price due hereunder equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards collected by Seller prior to Closing as a result of any such damage or destruction or condemnation, plus the amount of any insurance deductible not recoverable under the Leases, less any sums expended by Seller toward the restoration or repair of the Property, including barricades and other temporary repairs required for safety purposes, or in collecting such insurance proceeds or condemnation awards."

The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 6.5) introduces the concept of "Seller-Allocated Amounts" — a deduction for Seller's costs — which the buyer should resist or limit:

> "Purchaser shall receive a credit at Closing equal to (i) the amount of any such awards or proceeds on account of such condemnation or casualty, plus (ii) if a casualty has occurred and such casualty is an insured casualty, an amount equal to Seller's deductible with respect to such casualty, less (iii) an amount equal to the Seller-Allocated Amounts."

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Deductible credit is essential.** The buyer should always receive a credit for the full insurance deductible amount. Rationale: the deductible represents unrecovered loss, and since risk of loss is on Seller pre-closing, the deductible gap should not fall on buyer. All precedent forms provide for this credit.
- **Limit Seller's deductions for pre-Closing expenditures.** Seller should only be permitted to deduct amounts actually expended for (a) emergency/safety repairs necessary to prevent further damage and (b) reasonable costs of prosecuting the insurance claim. Seller should NOT be permitted to deduct for discretionary repairs, restoration work, or general operating expenses.
- **Require Seller to cooperate post-Closing on assigned claims.** When proceeds are assigned rather than credited, buyer bears the risk of insurance collection. Require Seller to (a) not settle or compromise the claim without buyer's consent, (b) cooperate with buyer in prosecuting the claim, and (c) provide all documentation and access needed by buyer's adjusters.
- **Business interruption and rent loss proceeds should be apportioned.** Proceeds allocable to the period before Closing belong to Seller; proceeds allocable to the post-Closing period belong to Buyer. This apportionment should be expressly addressed.
- **Assignment of claims vs. assignment of proceeds.** Buyer should receive an assignment of the entire insurance claim (right to prosecute and collect), not merely an assignment of the right to receive specific proceeds. The distinction matters if additional damage is discovered post-Closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller should be entitled to retain insurance proceeds allocable to its pre-Closing period of ownership (especially business interruption insurance for lost rent prior to Closing). Seller may also argue that it should be reimbursed for all restoration expenditures (not just emergency repairs) from the proceeds credit.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept that Seller retains business interruption/rent loss proceeds allocable to the pre-Closing period, but require a clear apportionment methodology (per diem based on the Closing Date) and require that Buyer receive all proceeds allocable to the post-Closing period.
2. Accept Seller's deduction for actual, documented pre-Closing repair expenditures (not just emergency repairs) if Seller provides receipts and the total deduction is capped at a reasonable amount (e.g., 10% of the total insurance proceeds or a fixed dollar cap).
3. If Seller insists on retaining "Seller-Allocated Amounts," require a specific definition that is limited to: (a) documented out-of-pocket repair costs, (b) third-party insurance claim prosecution costs, and (c) business interruption proceeds for the pre-Closing period only.
4. Accept assignment of proceeds (rather than claims) if (a) Seller covenants not to settle or compromise the claim without buyer's written consent, (b) Seller provides an indemnification for any act or omission by Seller that prejudices the insurance recovery, and (c) the deductible credit is still provided at Closing.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — The insurance assignment/credit mechanics determine whether the buyer is made whole when proceeding to Closing on a damaged property. Key risks include: (a) insurance coverage disputes that reduce or delay proceeds, (b) Seller spending proceeds on non-essential items before Closing, (c) insurance deductibles that leave a gap, and (d) co-insurance penalties if Seller was underinsured. The buyer should conduct insurance diligence during the inspection period to assess the adequacy of Seller's coverage.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Business interruption insurance is particularly important for office properties where rent loss during restoration can be substantial. Ensure the apportionment methodology covers both base rent and operating expense escalations.
- **Industrial:** Many industrial leases are NNN with tenant-carried insurance. Verify whether the relevant insurance policy is Seller's or tenant's, as the assignment mechanics will differ.
- **Retail:** Percentage rent components may not be covered by standard business interruption insurance. Buyer should verify coverage scope.
- **Multifamily:** Casualty insurance may not cover relocation costs imposed by local ordinances. Buyer should assess the gap.
- **Data Center:** Equipment breakdown insurance and business interruption coverage for data centers are specialized products. Standard property casualty policies may not cover the full value of infrastructure loss. Buyer must verify during diligence that Seller carries adequate specialized coverage.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Insurance assignment provisions must comply with the applicable insurance policy's anti-assignment clause. Most property insurance policies prohibit assignment without insurer consent. The PSA should require Seller to obtain insurer consent to assignment as a condition of the assignment mechanics.
- **New York:** The NY Negotiation Checklist recommends that buyer should be able to "close on the purchase of the property at the agreed price, and receive the condemnation awards or insurance proceeds."

## Condemnation Proceeding Participation Rights

### Preferred Position

Buyer must have the right to participate in any condemnation proceedings affecting the Property, both before and after Closing. Before Closing, this means Seller cannot settle, compromise, or consent to any condemnation award without Buyer's prior written consent. After Closing (if Buyer elects to proceed), Buyer must have full control of the condemnation proceedings.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "From and after the Effective Date, Seller shall not settle, compromise, or consent to any condemnation award or payment in lieu of condemnation without Buyer's prior written consent, which may be granted or withheld in Buyer's sole and absolute discretion. Buyer shall have the right to participate in and attend all proceedings, hearings, and negotiations related to any condemnation, and Seller shall provide Buyer with prompt copies of all filings, correspondence, and communications related thereto. At Closing, Seller shall assign to Buyer all of Seller's right, title, and interest in and to any pending condemnation proceedings and awards."

**Precedent comparison:**

| Form | Participation Rights | Settlement Consent |
|---|---|---|
| IL Pro-Buyer (Section 17.01) | "Purchaser shall be entitled to participate in any such condemnation proceedings" | Seller shall "not settle or condemnation claim or award without the prior written consent of Purchaser" |
| Seller (Income Property) (Section 9) | Not addressed | "Seller...shall not make any settlements without Buyer's prior written approval" |
| UNICO forms | Not addressed | Not addressed |
| Detailed Seller Side | Not addressed | Not addressed |

### Key Negotiation Points

- The right to participate must include: attendance at hearings, review of all filings, approval of Seller's litigation counsel (or appointment of buyer's own counsel), and approval of any settlement.
- Seller should bear the costs of the condemnation proceeding prosecution to the extent the proceeding commenced before Closing. Post-Closing, buyer bears the costs.
- Buyer should have the right to make an independent claim for damages to its equitable or contractual interest in the Property, in addition to (not in lieu of) Seller's fee simple condemnation claim.
- Require Seller to cooperate with Buyer's condemnation counsel and provide access to all Property records relevant to the valuation.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller is the fee owner and has the sole right to manage condemnation proceedings. Buyer's participation creates complications and delays. Seller should have the right to settle proceedings expeditiously.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept that Seller manages the proceedings but require Seller to (a) keep buyer informed of all material developments, (b) not settle without buyer's consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld), and (c) provide buyer with copies of all filings and correspondence.
2. Accept Seller's management with an "unreasonable withholding" standard on buyer's settlement consent, but retain buyer's absolute veto for any settlement below 80% of the appraised diminution in value.
3. Waive participation rights entirely if (a) the condemnation is immaterial and (b) Buyer receives a full assignment of proceeds at Closing. Retain full participation rights for material condemnations.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM-HIGH** — Without participation rights, Seller could settle a condemnation proceeding for less than full value (Seller's incentive is to close the deal quickly, not to maximize the condemnation award that will pass to buyer). This risk is particularly acute when Seller has already found an alternative buyer or has economic incentives to expedite the closing.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The participation right is structurally the same across asset types, but the valuation methodology in condemnation proceedings varies. For retail and office properties, the buyer should ensure that the highest-and-best-use analysis accounts for the property's income-producing potential, not just land value.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **California:** Cal. Code Civ. Proc. Section 1263.010 et seq. governs condemnation valuation. The "fair market value" standard may not capture the buyer's investment-specific value. Participation rights allow the buyer to present evidence of the property's income-producing capacity.
- **New York:** NY Eminent Domain Procedure Law (EDPL) provides specific procedural rights. Buyer should ensure contractual participation rights are consistent with statutory procedures.
- **Texas:** Texas condemnation proceedings under Tex. Prop. Code Chapter 21 require "special commissioners" to assess damages. The buyer should have the right to participate in the commissioner hearing.

## Seller's Restoration Obligations

### Preferred Position

Buyer should not require Seller to undertake restoration — instead, buyer's preferred position is to receive the insurance proceeds (or a credit) and manage restoration itself post-Closing. Seller-managed restoration is risky because Seller has diminished incentives to restore to high standards if it is conveying the Property.

**Preferred framework:**

> "Seller shall have no obligation to repair or restore any damage or destruction to the Property. In lieu of restoration, Seller shall assign to Buyer all insurance proceeds and claims as provided herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall (a) take all reasonable measures to prevent further damage to the Property (temporary weatherproofing, barricading unsafe areas, securing the building), (b) not demolish or remove any portion of the Property without Buyer's prior written consent, and (c) maintain compliance with all applicable building codes and governmental orders related to the casualty."

All precedent forms align with this approach. The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 12.2) states: "Seller shall not be obligated to repair any damage or destruction." The Seller (Income Property) form (Section 9) confirms: Seller has "no obligation to repair or replace any damage or destruction (other than to safeguard the Property against damage from the elements)."

### Key Negotiation Points

- While buyer should generally prefer receiving proceeds over Seller-managed restoration, the buyer should retain the right to require Seller to undertake emergency stabilization measures (temporary roof, barricading, weatherproofing).
- Seller should not be permitted to commence restoration without buyer's consent, as Seller-managed restoration may (a) use different materials or standards than buyer would choose, (b) create construction defect liability, and (c) consume insurance proceeds inefficiently.
- If Seller has already commenced restoration before buyer's election, buyer should have the right to direct the scope and contractor selection going forward.
- Seller should maintain the Property in its post-casualty condition (other than emergency stabilization) and not make discretionary changes that could affect insurance recovery.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller should have the option (not obligation) to restore the Property, particularly if the damage is minor and Seller wants to present a clean property to close the deal on time.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept Seller's option to restore only if: (a) restoration must be completed before the Closing Date (no extension), (b) the work must be done to buyer's reasonable satisfaction, (c) buyer approves the contractor and scope of work, and (d) if restoration is incomplete at Closing, buyer receives a holdback or credit for the estimated cost to complete.
2. Accept Seller's option to restore minor damage (below the materiality threshold) without buyer's approval, but require buyer's approval for any restoration of material damage.
3. If Seller insists on restoration, require a completion guarantee (e.g., a holdback in escrow equal to 125% of the estimated remaining cost to complete) and a warranty that the restoration will be free from defects for 12 months following Closing.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — Seller-managed restoration creates execution risk, quality risk, and timeline risk. However, refusing any Seller restoration can delay Closing while buyer waits for insurance proceeds. The practical approach is to allow Seller to stabilize but not restore, with buyer managing full restoration post-Closing.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Tenant improvements may need to be restored to different specifications for different tenants. Seller should not undertake TI restoration.
- **Industrial:** Structural restoration of industrial buildings (clear-span, tilt-up) is relatively straightforward. Seller-managed restoration of minor damage is more acceptable here than in other asset types.
- **Data Center:** Restoration must be performed by specialized contractors to maintain uptime certifications. Seller should never undertake data center restoration without buyer's express written consent and buyer's right to select the contractor.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **No jurisdiction-specific rules govern contractual restoration obligations.** However, local building codes may require the property owner of record to obtain permits and commence certain repairs within specified timeframes following a casualty. The PSA should address responsibility for compliance with these requirements during the gap between casualty and Closing.

---

## Deductible Responsibility

### Preferred Position

Seller bears 100% of the insurance deductible for any casualty occurring before Closing. The buyer should receive a credit at Closing equal to the full deductible amount, in addition to the assignment or credit of insurance proceeds.

**Rationale:** The deductible represents the portion of the loss not covered by insurance. Since risk of loss is allocated to Seller pre-Closing, the uninsured first-dollar loss (the deductible) should also be Seller's responsibility. Without a deductible credit, the buyer closes on a property that is damaged to the extent of the deductible but receives no compensation for that gap.

**Precedent support:** All forms that address deductibles allocate them to Seller:

- UNICO Buyer Side (Section 12.1): "plus the amount of any insurance deductible not recoverable under the Leases"
- UNICO Seller Side (Section 12.1): same language
- Detailed Seller Side (Section 6.5): "an amount equal to Seller's deductible with respect to such casualty"

### Key Negotiation Points

- Confirm that the deductible credit applies to both "minor" and "major" casualty scenarios.
- The credit should be for the "applicable deductible" — not a hypothetical or market-standard deductible. If Seller chose a high-deductible policy to save on premiums, that is Seller's risk.
- Address scenarios with multiple deductibles (e.g., a hurricane causes both wind damage and flood damage, each with separate deductibles). The credit should cover all applicable deductibles.
- For Leases where tenants are responsible for deductibles (common in NNN industrial leases), the forms carve out recovery from tenants: "deductible not recoverable under the Leases." Buyer should verify which Leases provide for tenant deductible responsibility.
- Named-storm or earthquake deductibles (often 2-5% of insured value) can be enormous. The buyer should assess Seller's deductible structure during insurance diligence.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** The deductible is a normal cost of insurance and buyer would face the same deductible if the casualty occurred after Closing. Seller may resist providing a deductible credit, arguing that the insurance proceeds themselves are sufficient compensation.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. The deductible credit is non-negotiable for institutional deals. Hold firm on this point.
2. If Seller absolutely refuses, negotiate for a credit equal to the "standard market deductible" for the applicable type of coverage (e.g., $25,000 for a standard property policy) even if Seller's actual deductible is higher — but only as a last resort, and document that buyer is assuming the excess deductible risk.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — For standard property insurance deductibles ($10,000-$100,000), the financial exposure is manageable. However, for catastrophic perils (earthquake, flood, wind), deductibles can be 2-5% of insured value — potentially $1M-$5M+ on a $100M property. This makes deductible allocation a significant financial issue, not a trivial one.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Data Center:** Equipment breakdown deductibles can be very high. Verify whether Seller carries equipment breakdown coverage and the applicable deductible.
- **Coastal retail/office (FL, TX Gulf Coast, Carolinas):** Named-storm deductibles are percentage-based and can be enormous. This is the most significant deductible exposure for institutional buyers.
- **California:** Earthquake deductibles are typically 10-15% of insured value. On a $100M property, the earthquake deductible alone could be $10M-$15M.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **No state law governs contractual deductible allocation.** This is entirely negotiated. However, in jurisdictions with catastrophic peril risks, the practical magnitude of the deductible makes this a high-stakes negotiation point.

---

## Uninsured Casualty Risk Allocation

### Preferred Position

Uninsured casualties should give buyer a termination right regardless of whether the damage is above or below the materiality threshold. If the damage is not covered by insurance, the buyer faces a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the property's value with no offsetting insurance recovery. The buyer should not be required to absorb any uninsured loss.

**Preferred framework:**

> "If the Property suffers damage or destruction from any cause that is not covered by Seller's insurance policies (an 'Uninsured Casualty'), Buyer shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to Seller within [20] Business Days after receipt of Seller's notice of the Uninsured Casualty, to terminate this Agreement and receive a full return of the Earnest Money Deposit. If Buyer elects to proceed, Buyer shall receive a credit against the Purchase Price equal to the full estimated cost to repair the uninsured damage."

**Precedent comparison:**

| Form | Uninsured Casualty Treatment |
|---|---|
| UNICO Buyer Side (Section 12.2) | Uninsured damage is independently triggering for Major Loss termination right ("damage or destruction is not covered by insurance maintained by Seller") |
| IL Pro-Buyer (Section 17.02) | Dedicated section: Buyer has right to terminate for uninsured casualty; if Buyer does not terminate, Seller must provide credit equal to cost of repair, or Seller may elect not to provide credit, in which case Buyer can terminate |
| Detailed Seller Side | Not separately addressed |
| Seller (Income Property) | Not addressed |

### Key Negotiation Points

- The UNICO Buyer Side form treats uninsured damage as independently triggering the "Major Loss" termination right, regardless of the dollar amount. This is the preferred approach.
- The IL Pro-Buyer form (Section 17.02) provides the most detailed uninsured casualty framework, including a "Seller nullification election" — Seller can elect not to provide a credit, which re-triggers buyer's termination right. While complex, this mechanism protects both sides.
- The buyer should require Seller to represent during diligence that insurance coverage is adequate and that there are no material exclusions. The PSA should list required insurance coverages (property, liability, business interruption, flood, earthquake where applicable).
- Address common exclusion gaps: terrorism (TRIA), mold, pollution, communicable disease, cyber-physical damage (relevant for data centers).
- If buyer agrees to proceed with an uninsured casualty, the Purchase Price credit should be based on the buyer's reasonable estimate of cost to repair (not Seller's estimate).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller maintained reasonable insurance and should not be penalized for events outside normal coverage (e.g., acts of war, nuclear incidents). The buyer should carry its own insurance from contract execution.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept a de minimis exception — uninsured casualties below a small threshold ($100,000) do not trigger a termination right, but buyer receives a dollar-for-dollar Purchase Price credit.
2. Accept Seller's position on truly extraordinary exclusions (nuclear, war, governmental action) but retain termination rights for common uninsured perils (flood in a non-flood-zone property, earthquake in a non-seismic-zone property) where Seller chose not to purchase available coverage.
3. Accept that Seller is not responsible for uninsured loss if Seller maintained insurance meeting minimum specifications agreed during diligence — but require those specifications to be attached as an exhibit.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Uninsured casualty is one of the most dangerous scenarios for a buyer because there is no insurance recovery to offset the loss. The buyer takes title to a damaged property and bears the full cost of restoration. This risk is amplified in areas prone to perils that are commonly excluded from standard policies (flood, earthquake, terrorism).

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily:** Flood insurance (NFIP or private) may not cover the full replacement cost. Verify during diligence.
- **Data Center:** Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) and cyber-physical damage are emerging uninsured risks for data centers.
- **Industrial:** Pollution liability is typically excluded from standard property policies. A fire or structural collapse in an industrial facility that releases hazardous materials could trigger both a casualty and an environmental liability with no insurance coverage for the latter.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Florida:** Sinkhole coverage exclusions are common. Ensure the PSA addresses sinkhole damage as a named peril.
- **California:** Earthquake insurance is not required by law and many property owners decline it due to high premiums and deductibles. Verify during diligence.
- **Coastal jurisdictions:** Named-storm and flood exclusions can create significant coverage gaps. Post-hurricane, the dispute over whether damage was caused by "wind" (covered) or "storm surge/flood" (excluded) is a major coverage issue.

## Business Interruption and Rent Loss Insurance Proceeds

### Preferred Position

Business interruption ("BI") and rent loss insurance proceeds must be apportioned between Seller and Buyer based on the Closing Date, with Buyer receiving all proceeds allocable to the post-Closing period.

**Preferred framework:**

> "All business interruption insurance proceeds, rent loss insurance proceeds, and any other time-element insurance proceeds shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer as of the Closing Date on a per diem basis. Proceeds allocable to the period from the date of the casualty through the Closing Date shall belong to Seller. Proceeds allocable to the period from the Closing Date through the end of the covered restoration period shall belong to Buyer. Seller shall assign to Buyer at Closing all rights to receive rent loss and business interruption insurance proceeds allocable to the post-Closing period."

### Key Negotiation Points

- None of the precedent forms separately address BI/rent loss proceeds — they are subsumed within the general "insurance proceeds" credit and assignment framework. The buyer should insist on a separate provision because BI proceeds are time-based (not property-damage-based) and must be apportioned temporally.
- The apportionment should be based on actual rent loss, not a theoretical calculation. If a tenant abates rent for 6 months post-casualty and 3 of those months are pre-Closing, Seller receives 3 months of BI proceeds and Buyer receives 3 months.
- BI proceeds should cover not just base rent but also reimbursable expenses (CAM, taxes, insurance) that tenants would have paid absent the casualty.
- Verify during diligence that Seller's BI policy has adequate "extended period of indemnity" coverage — standard policies cover lost income only during the physical restoration period, but tenants may not return immediately after restoration is complete.
- If Buyer is receiving rental prorations at Closing, ensure there is no double-counting between rental prorations and BI proceeds credits.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** BI proceeds are Seller's property because Seller paid the premiums and the loss occurred during Seller's ownership period.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept Seller's retention of BI proceeds for the pre-Closing period, but require an assignment of all post-Closing BI proceeds as part of the insurance assignment at Closing.
2. Accept a Purchase Price credit in lieu of BI proceeds assignment, calculated as the estimated rent loss for the restoration period from Closing through estimated restoration completion.
3. If Seller insists on retaining all BI proceeds, require a corresponding reduction in the Purchase Price equal to the estimated post-Closing rent loss.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM-HIGH** — For income-producing properties, the income stream is the primary source of value. A casualty that causes 6-12 months of rent loss can represent 5-10% of property value. If the buyer takes title without BI proceeds for the post-Closing restoration period, it effectively pays full price for a property producing no income.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** BI policies for office properties typically cover "rents and other charges" including operating expense reimbursements. Verify coverage scope.
- **Retail:** Percentage rent components are often excluded from BI coverage. For retail properties with significant percentage rent exposure, this represents an uninsured gap.
- **Industrial:** NNN leases may require tenants to carry their own BI insurance, in which case Seller's BI policy may provide limited coverage.
- **Multifamily:** BI coverage for multifamily often covers "fair rental value" rather than actual collected rents. Verify the valuation methodology.
- **Data Center:** BI exposure in data centers is extreme because tenant SLA penalties can exceed the rent loss itself. Verify whether Seller's BI policy covers contractual penalty exposure.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **No state law governs apportionment of BI proceeds in a PSA.** This is entirely contractual. Courts will enforce the parties' agreed apportionment.

## Effect on Tenant Lease Termination Rights

### Preferred Position

If a casualty or condemnation triggers any tenant's right to terminate its Lease, that event should be independently deemed "material" — giving buyer a termination right regardless of whether the damage otherwise meets the dollar or percentage threshold.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "If any casualty or condemnation event gives rise to, or is reasonably expected to give rise to, a right of any Tenant to terminate its Lease (whether by express termination provision, constructive eviction, or applicable law), such event shall be deemed a Material Casualty or Material Taking, as applicable, regardless of the cost to repair or the dollar amount of the diminution in value. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any Tenant communication (written or verbal) relating to a potential Lease termination in connection with any casualty or condemnation event."

**Precedent support:**

The NY Negotiation Checklist expressly recommends: "Negotiate that the purchaser has the option to terminate the purchase and sale agreement if a casualty or condemnation causes any tenant to terminate its lease." None of the precedent PSA forms include this protection — it must be added by negotiation.

### Key Negotiation Points

- This protection is critically important for single-tenant properties and for properties where a Major Tenant represents a disproportionate share of rental income.
- The trigger should include not just actual tenant termination but also the exercise (or reasonable expectation of exercise) of a tenant termination right. The buyer should not have to wait until a tenant actually terminates to exercise its own PSA termination right.
- The provision should cover termination rights arising from: (a) express casualty/condemnation termination provisions in the Lease, (b) constructive eviction claims, (c) applicable landlord-tenant statutes (e.g., premises rendered "untenantable"), and (d) any co-tenancy provision triggered by another tenant's departure.
- Buyer should review all Major Tenant leases during diligence to identify the specific casualty and condemnation termination provisions, including any restoration deadlines and abatement thresholds.
- The buyer's termination right should extend for a reasonable period (30-60 days) after the tenant's lease termination right expires, to give buyer time to determine whether the tenant will actually exercise its right.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Tenant termination rights are inherent in the Leases and buyer accepted them during diligence. A tenant having a right to terminate does not mean it will terminate. This provision gives buyer an excessive termination right for minor events.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Limit the provision to Major Tenants (as defined in the PSA) and tenants occupying more than a specified percentage (e.g., 20%) of the GLA.
2. Require that the tenant must actually deliver a termination notice (not merely have the right to terminate) before buyer's PSA termination right is triggered.
3. Accept that the tenant-termination trigger applies only if the affected tenant(s) represent, in aggregate, more than 25% of the Property's gross rental income.
4. Accept a Purchase Price reduction in lieu of termination — if a tenant terminates its Lease due to casualty/condemnation, the Purchase Price is reduced by the capitalized value of the lost rental income (using the agreed cap rate).

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL for single-tenant and anchor-tenant properties** — For single-tenant NNN properties, the tenant IS the value. If the tenant terminates its lease due to a pre-Closing casualty, the buyer is purchasing a vacant, damaged building. For multi-tenant properties where a major tenant represents 40%+ of income, the same dynamic applies. For diversified multi-tenant properties with no dominant tenant, this risk is lower but still meaningful due to co-tenancy cascading effects.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Single-tenant or dominant-tenant office buildings (common in suburban markets) require this protection as a non-negotiable term.
- **Industrial:** Build-to-suit and single-tenant industrial properties have the same profile. Additionally, industrial tenants often have specialized improvement requirements — a casualty that cannot be restored to the tenant's specifications may trigger termination even if the building is otherwise repairable.
- **Retail:** Co-tenancy clauses in retail leases create cascading risk. If an anchor tenant terminates due to casualty, multiple inline tenants may gain termination or rent reduction rights. The buyer needs to model the cascade effect during diligence.
- **Multifamily:** Generally less relevant (no single tenant drives the property's value), but large-format multifamily with ground-floor retail or commercial tenants should still address this risk.
- **Data Center:** Hyperscale data center leases typically have aggressive casualty termination provisions with short restoration deadlines. This trigger is critical for data center acquisitions.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Tenant lease termination rights triggered by casualty are governed by the Lease terms and applicable landlord-tenant law. In some states (e.g., New York), if premises are rendered "untenantable," the tenant may have a statutory right to terminate regardless of the Lease terms.

---

## Closing Extension for Casualty/Condemnation Events

### Preferred Position

The Closing Date should automatically extend by a reasonable period following any casualty or condemnation event to allow buyer adequate time to (a) receive Seller's notice, (b) evaluate the event, (c) exercise its election, (d) coordinate with its lender, and (e) restructure closing logistics if necessary.

**Preferred framework:**

> "If a casualty or condemnation event occurs within [30] days of the Closing Date, the Closing Date shall be automatically extended to the date that is [30] days following the later of (a) Buyer's receipt of Seller's complete notice of such event and (b) Buyer's delivery of its election to proceed or terminate. During any such extension period, neither party shall be deemed in default for failure to close."

**Precedent support:**

- Meadows (Section 6.3): "If necessary, the Closing Date shall be postponed until Seller has given any notice to Buyer required by this Section 6.3 and the period of [__] days described in this Section 6.3 has expired, and the restoration cost has been determined by Seller."
- Meadows (Section 6.4): "If necessary, the Closing Date shall be postponed until Seller has given any notice to Buyer required by this Section 6.4 and the period of ten (10) business days described in this Section 6.4 has expired."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The extension should be automatic (not requiring affirmative exercise or an extension fee). The UNICO forms and the Detailed Seller Side form do not include automatic extensions, which creates a timing trap for the buyer if a casualty occurs close to the Closing Date.
- The extension must be long enough to encompass (a) Seller's notice delivery period, (b) Buyer's election period, (c) any insurance adjustment period, and (d) time for buyer's lender to update its underwriting. A 30-day minimum extension from the casualty event is appropriate.
- The extension should toll or suspend any financing commitment expiration dates referenced in the PSA (though the buyer will also need to manage this with its lender separately).
- If buyer elects to proceed, there may need to be a further extension to allow for the insurance assignment/credit mechanics to be finalized.
- The extension should not require buyer to pay an extension fee or additional earnest money.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Closing extensions create uncertainty and may cause Seller's 1031 exchange deadlines, loan payoff commitments, or other contractual obligations to be jeopardized. An open-ended extension is unacceptable.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept a maximum outside extension date (e.g., 60 days from the originally scheduled Closing Date or 30 days from buyer's election, whichever is later), after which either party may terminate.
2. Accept an extension that only applies if the casualty/condemnation occurs within a specified period before the scheduled Closing Date (e.g., within 30 days).
3. Accept that the extension applies only to the election mechanics (tolling the Closing Date through the end of the election period) but the Closing must occur within 10 business days after buyer's election to proceed.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — Without a Closing extension, a casualty occurring on the day before Closing forces the buyer into an impossible timing crunch: it must simultaneously evaluate the damage, make an election, coordinate with its lender, and close — all on the same day. The extension provision is a procedural safeguard that prevents mechanical default.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The extension provision operates the same way regardless of asset type. The required length of the extension may vary based on the complexity of the property and the time needed for damage assessment.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **No jurisdiction-specific rules apply.** Extension provisions are entirely contractual.

---

## UVPRA (Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act) Considerations

### Preferred Position

The PSA must expressly waive and override the UVPRA and any other state statute or common-law doctrine that would otherwise allocate risk of loss to the buyer before Closing.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "The provisions of the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act (or any equivalent state statute, including without limitation [applicable state citation]), and any common-law doctrine of equitable conversion, are hereby waived by the parties and shall not apply to this Agreement. The risk of loss provisions set forth in this Article shall govern exclusively."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The UVPRA has been adopted (with variations) in approximately 12 states, including California, Hawaii, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.
- In UVPRA states, the default rule allocates risk to the buyer if the buyer has taken "possession" or holds "legal title." Since diligence access and pre-Closing tenant coordination could arguably constitute "possession," the waiver must be express.
- The IL Pro-Buyer form contains the gold-standard override language: "the parties intend for the provisions of [this Article] to supersede any law applicable to the Property governing the effect of fire or other casualty or condemnation in contracts for real property."
- In non-UVPRA states, the common-law doctrine of equitable conversion may still apply. The waiver should cover both statutory and common-law risk allocation rules.
- The NY Negotiation Checklist specifically calls out: "Confirm that the parties waive the provisions of Section 5-1311 of the General Obligations Law of the State of New York."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Statutory waivers are unnecessary if the PSA contains a comprehensive casualty/condemnation section.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. This is a non-negotiable provision. The waiver costs Seller nothing and prevents ambiguity. If Seller resists an express waiver, accept a general statement that "this Article constitutes the parties' entire agreement regarding risk of loss and supersedes any statutory or common-law default rules."

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Failure to waive the UVPRA can create conflicting risk allocation between the statute and the contract. In a coverage dispute or litigation, the absence of an express waiver could be argued as the parties' intent to retain the statutory framework as a fallback. The waiver eliminates this ambiguity at zero cost.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **No variation by asset type.** The UVPRA waiver is a universal provision.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Section 5-1311 GOL (UVPRA). Express waiver required per NY Negotiation Checklist.
- **California:** Cal. Civ. Code Section 1662. Express waiver recommended.
- **Illinois:** 765 ILCS 65/1 (UVPRA). The IL Pro-Buyer form contains the model override language.
- **Texas:** Tex. Prop. Code Section 5.007. Express waiver standard in institutional deals.
- **Oregon:** ORS 93.270 (UVPRA). The UNICO and Meadows forms (Oregon deals) do not contain express waivers — buyer should add one.
- **Non-UVPRA states:** In states that have not adopted the UVPRA, the common-law equitable conversion doctrine may still apply. A general override of "any statute or common-law doctrine allocating risk of loss" is sufficient.

---

## Seller's Obligation to Maintain Insurance

### Preferred Position

Seller must covenant to maintain all existing casualty, liability, and business interruption insurance coverage in force at the time of contract execution through Closing, at minimum coverage levels specified in the PSA.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "From the Effective Date through the Closing Date, Seller shall maintain in full force and effect all casualty, property damage, general liability, business interruption, rent loss, and other insurance policies currently in force with respect to the Property, with coverage limits, deductibles, and terms no less favorable than those in effect as of the Effective Date. Seller shall not reduce coverage, increase deductibles, or allow any policy to lapse or be cancelled without Buyer's prior written consent."

**Precedent support:**

- Seller (Income Property) form (Section 7(d)): "Seller shall maintain all casualty and liability insurance currently in force with respect to the Property."
- Detailed Seller Side (Section 6.6(c)): Seller shall "insure the Property substantially as it is currently insured."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The covenant should be affirmative (maintain insurance) rather than merely negative (do not cancel insurance). Seller should be required to timely pay premiums and comply with policy conditions.
- Buyer should obtain copies of all insurance policies (or certificates of insurance with full policy details) during diligence and attach them as an exhibit.
- The covenant should include not just property casualty insurance but also: general liability, business interruption/rent loss, flood (if in a flood zone), earthquake (if in a seismic zone), umbrella/excess coverage, and any terrorism coverage (TRIA).
- Address what happens if the insurer cancels or non-renews during the contract period — Seller should be required to promptly obtain replacement coverage from a comparable carrier.
- Confirm that Buyer (or its designee) is added as an additional insured and loss payee on Seller's policies.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller already maintains adequate insurance as a matter of course and does not want to be locked into specific coverage requirements that may not be available or affordable at renewal.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept "substantially similar" coverage rather than identical coverage, but require Seller to notify Buyer of any material changes in coverage, deductibles, or carrier.
2. Accept that Seller need not maintain earthquake or flood insurance if it does not currently carry such coverage, but require Seller to disclose this so buyer can arrange its own coverage or price the risk.
3. Accept a general covenant to "maintain insurance in a manner consistent with prudent commercial real estate ownership practices" if Seller provides certificates of insurance within 5 business days of request.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — If Seller allows insurance to lapse before Closing and a casualty occurs, the buyer's insurance assignment/credit mechanics are worthless. The entire casualty protection framework depends on Seller maintaining adequate insurance through Closing.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Data Center:** Verify that Seller maintains specialized coverage (equipment breakdown, errors and omissions for SLA compliance).
- **Retail:** Verify that Seller's policy covers tenant improvement buildouts and inline store fixtures.
- **Industrial:** Verify environmental impairment liability coverage for properties storing hazardous materials.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **No jurisdiction-specific rules require a seller to maintain insurance during a PSA period.** This is entirely contractual.

## Condemnation Award and Insurance Proceeds — Post-Closing Cooperation

### Preferred Position

Seller must cooperate with Buyer after Closing in pursuing and collecting any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards that have been assigned to Buyer but not yet paid. This cooperation obligation should survive Closing without time limitation.

**Preferred provisions:**

1. Seller shall execute all documents and take all actions reasonably requested by Buyer to prosecute the insurance claim or condemnation proceeding.
2. Seller shall not communicate with the insurer or condemning authority regarding the assigned claim without Buyer's prior written consent.
3. Seller shall make its personnel, records, and files available to Buyer and its counsel/adjusters.
4. Buyer shall bear the costs of post-Closing prosecution of the claim.
5. Seller's cooperation obligation shall survive Closing for a period of not less than 3 years (or until all claims are fully resolved).

**Precedent support:**

The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 6.5(b)) addresses the post-Closing scenario but from a Seller-favorable angle — requiring Buyer to pay Seller the "Seller-Allocated Amounts" within 3 business days of receipt of proceeds. The buyer should mirror this with a reciprocal Seller cooperation obligation.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Without an express cooperation covenant, Seller has no post-Closing obligation to assist Buyer in collecting assigned proceeds. Seller may have moved on to other transactions and have no incentive to cooperate.
- Include a mechanism for Seller to deliver a proof of loss, sworn statement, or other insurance-required documentation if needed.
- Address the scenario where the insurer requires Seller (as the original insured) to participate in the claim process — Seller should be required to do so at Buyer's cost.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller's obligations should end at Closing. Post-Closing cooperation is burdensome and open-ended.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept a time-limited cooperation obligation (2-3 years) with Buyer bearing all costs.
2. Accept cooperation "upon reasonable request" rather than an open-ended obligation, with Buyer reimbursing Seller's out-of-pocket costs.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — The risk materializes only when proceeds are assigned (not credited) at Closing and the insurer or condemning authority requires the original owner's participation. This is a practical risk in large and complex claims.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **No meaningful variation by asset type.** The cooperation obligation is structurally identical across all property types.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **No jurisdiction-specific rules apply.** Post-Closing cooperation obligations are entirely contractual.

## Seller's Covenant Not to Settle Condemnation or Insurance Claims

### Preferred Position

From the Effective Date through Closing (and thereafter with respect to assigned claims), Seller must not settle, compromise, or waive any insurance claim or condemnation proceeding without Buyer's prior written consent.

**Precedent support:**

- IL Pro-Buyer (Section 12): Seller shall "not settle or [any] condemnation claim or award without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which may be granted or withheld in Purchaser's sole and absolute discretion except in the case of an emergency."
- Seller (Income Property) (Section 9): "Seller shall assign to Buyer its rights to any condemnation proceeds resulting from such taking and shall not make any settlements without Buyer's prior written approval."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The consent standard should be Buyer's "sole and absolute discretion" — not a "reasonableness" standard. Seller should not be able to accept a lowball settlement over buyer's objection.
- Include insurance claims as well as condemnation awards. Seller could compromise an insurance claim for a quick settlement that is less than the full replacement cost.
- Address the emergency exception — if immediate action is needed to prevent further loss (e.g., accepting a partial insurance advance for emergency repairs), Seller should be permitted to act without consent but must provide immediate notice to Buyer.
- The covenant should extend beyond Closing for any claims that are assigned to Buyer but where Seller remains a named party.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Seller will argue:** Seller needs flexibility to manage claims efficiently, particularly for small claims that are not worth the buyer's involvement.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept a de minimis exception — Seller may settle claims below $50,000 without consent.
2. Accept "consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed" for immaterial claims (below the materiality threshold) while retaining sole discretion for material claims.
3. Accept an emergency exception allowing Seller to accept partial insurance advances for emergency stabilization without consent, provided Buyer receives prompt notice and the acceptance does not prejudice the remaining claim.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM-HIGH** — A premature or undervalued settlement directly reduces the buyer's recovery. This is particularly dangerous in condemnation proceedings where the initial government offer is often significantly below fair market value, and in insurance claims where first adjuster estimates frequently understate repair costs.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **No meaningful variation by asset type.** The anti-settlement covenant operates the same way across all property types.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **No jurisdiction-specific rules apply.** The anti-settlement covenant is entirely contractual.
