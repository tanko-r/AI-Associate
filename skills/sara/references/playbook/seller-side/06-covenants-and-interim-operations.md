# Covenants and Interim Operating Obligations — Seller Playbook

This playbook addresses the Covenants and Interim Operating Obligations provisions of a commercial real estate purchase and sale agreement from the **seller** perspective. It is designed for use by AI agents conducting contract review on behalf of institutional sellers disposing of income-producing commercial real estate ($50M+ transactions). The seller's primary objectives during the interim period are: (a) preserve flexibility to continue operating and leasing the property in the ordinary course; (b) minimize affirmative obligations that could create default risk; (c) avoid transferring operational control to the buyer before closing; and (d) limit post-closing exposure arising from interim-period conduct.

## General Maintenance and Operation Standard

### Preferred Position

Seller's maintenance and operation covenant should be limited to continuing to operate the Property in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, subject to reasonable wear and tear, casualty, condemnation, and events beyond Seller's reasonable control. The standard should not impose obligations greater than Seller's pre-signing practices, should not require Seller to make capital expenditures it would not otherwise make, and should not create an objective standard that is measured against hypothetical "institutional" or "prudent" practices.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Seller Side, Section 9.1):**

> "Seller shall maintain and operate the Property in the same manner as prior to the Effective Date pursuant to its normal course of business, subject to reasonable wear and tear and damage or destruction by casualty or other events beyond the control of Seller."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Resist any standard higher than "ordinary course of business consistent with past practice." Buyers will attempt to insert "sound property management practices" or "institutional standards" — these create objective benchmarks that may exceed Seller's historical operating level and expose Seller to claims of covenant breach.
- Insist on carve-outs for: (a) reasonable wear and tear, (b) casualty damage (governed by the separate casualty provision), (c) condemnation (governed separately), and (d) force majeure / events beyond Seller's control.
- Resist any prohibition on deferring maintenance or capital expenditures. Seller should not be required to make capital investments in a property it is about to sell. If Seller has been deferring capital maintenance prior to signing (as reflected in historical operating budgets), that is the "ordinary course" standard the covenant should measure.
- Resist any requirement to maintain staffing levels or on-site management presence at specific levels. Seller may need to restructure management as part of the disposition process.
- The Meadows form (Section 6.1) includes a "sound property management practice" qualifier — this is a buyer-favorable insertion that should be resisted or modified to "Seller's customary practice."
- The UNICO Seller Side (Section 9.1) uses a clean "same manner as prior to the Effective Date" standard without the "sound practice" overlay. This is the preferred Seller formulation.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Seller may reduce operating standards, defer maintenance, or cut costs once a sale is agreed, shifting expenses to the buyer. Buyer needs an objective standard to measure Seller's performance.

**Fallback chain (in priority order):**

1. Accept "ordinary course of business consistent with past practice" with a definition of "past practice" as the twelve months preceding the Effective Date. This gives Buyer an objective benchmark without imposing a higher standard.
2. Accept a prohibition on reducing operating expenditures below 85% of the trailing-twelve-month average (rather than 90%, which buyers prefer), excluding one-time or non-recurring expenditures.
3. Accept a general "good property management practices" qualifier, but add "as determined in Seller's reasonable discretion" to preserve Seller's judgment.
4. If Buyer insists on a capital expenditure maintenance obligation, limit it to expenditures required by (a) applicable law, (b) the terms of the Leases, or (c) emergency conditions threatening life safety. All other capital expenditures should be at Seller's sole discretion.
5. Accept a materiality threshold for the maintenance covenant: Seller is not in breach unless the failure to maintain results in a Material Adverse Effect on the Property.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — An over-broad maintenance covenant can create an easy default trigger for a buyer seeking to exit the deal. If the covenant includes an objective standard (e.g., "institutional standards"), Buyer can argue any deviation constitutes a breach, potentially entitling Buyer to terminate or claim damages. Seller should resist vague, aspirational standards.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Resist obligations to maintain lobby aesthetics, tenant amenity programs, or aesthetic standards above Seller's historical level. Accept obligations to maintain life safety and building systems.
- **Industrial:** Minimal interim maintenance obligations are appropriate. Resist obligations to perform roof maintenance or parking lot work beyond Seller's historical cadence.
- **Retail:** Resist obligations to maintain holiday decoration programs, marketing fund expenditures, or aesthetic standards beyond contractual CAM obligations. Accept obligations under the Leases and REA.
- **Multifamily:** Resist obligations to continue unit renovation or value-add programs that were part of Seller's investment strategy. Accept obligations to maintain habitable conditions and comply with housing codes.
- **Data Center:** Accept heightened maintenance obligations for mission-critical infrastructure (UPS, generators, cooling) given the contractual SLA exposure under tenant leases, but limit obligations to manufacturer-recommended maintenance schedules already in place.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Texas:** No implied covenant of good faith in commercial contracts. The maintenance standard is strictly as written — draft precisely.
- **New York:** Courts will enforce the maintenance standard as written but may imply a duty of good faith. Avoid vague language that could be expanded by judicial interpretation.
- **California:** The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing may expand Seller's maintenance obligations beyond the literal language. Include a clear statement that the maintenance standard is limited to the express terms of the covenant.

## Insurance Maintenance

### Preferred Position

Seller should be required to maintain its existing insurance coverage through the Closing Date, but should retain discretion over carrier selection, coverage levels, and policy terms. Seller should not be required to name Buyer as an additional insured, maintain specific coverage limits, or maintain any insurance not currently in force. The covenant should reference "existing coverage" rather than impose any new or enhanced insurance requirements.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Seller Side, Section 9.1, and Meadows, Section 6.1):**

> "Seller shall maintain in full force and effect its existing insurance coverage with premiums paid through the Closing Date."

The Meadows form (Section 6.1) provides an even more Seller-favorable version: "Seller shall keep or cause to be kept in force insurance covering all buildings, structures, improvements, machinery, fixtures and equipment included in the Real Property insuring against risks of physical loss or damage, subject to standard exclusions, with such policy limits as Seller determines is prudent in the exercise of sound property management practices." The key Seller-protective element is "with such policy limits as Seller determines is prudent."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Resist any requirement to maintain specific coverage limits or deductibles. Market conditions and insurer requirements may change during the interim period, and Seller should not be locked into specific terms.
- Resist naming Buyer as an additional insured before closing. Until closing occurs, Buyer has no insurable interest in the Property (only a contractual right to purchase). If Buyer is concerned about casualty, the casualty provision governs.
- The PSA - Seller (income property) form (Section 8(c)) uses the cleanest Seller-favorable language: "Seller shall maintain all casualty and liability insurance currently in force with respect to the Property." No additional requirements.
- The Meadows form (Section 6.1) disclaims any obligation to carry or maintain insurance: "Nothing in this Section 6.3 shall be deemed to constitute an obligation on the part of Seller to carry or maintain any insurance of any kind whatsoever pertaining to the Property." This is extraordinarily Seller-favorable and applies to the casualty section, not the covenant, but illustrates the Seller's preferred framing.
- Resist any notice obligation regarding policy changes. Insurance renewals and modifications are ordinary course and should not trigger buyer notification requirements.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer needs assurance that the property will be insured through closing to protect the deal value. Buyer will request: (a) specific coverage limits, (b) notice of cancellation or reduction, (c) naming as additional insured, and (d) minimum carrier ratings.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a notice obligation for insurance cancellation (not for routine policy changes), limited to events that result in the Property being uninsured for any period.
2. Accept a covenant to maintain "substantially equivalent" coverage if Seller changes carriers during the interim period, but retain Seller's discretion on policy terms.
3. Accept a minimum carrier rating requirement (A.M. Best A-/VII), as this is typically not restrictive for institutional sellers.
4. Resist naming Buyer as additional insured. If pressed, agree that Buyer may be named as additional insured for liability coverage only (not property coverage) at Buyer's cost.
5. Accept a general covenant to maintain insurance "as required under the Leases" — this is already Seller's obligation and adds no incremental burden.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Insurance maintenance is a low-risk covenant for Seller because institutional sellers will maintain insurance through closing as a matter of course. The risk is that overly prescriptive requirements create a technical default if the insurer imposes changed terms at renewal.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The insurance covenant is substantially similar. For data center properties, Seller may already carry equipment breakdown coverage, which Buyer will want to confirm — accept confirmation but resist new coverage requirements.
- **Coastal properties (FL, TX, SC):** Wind and flood insurance may be separate policies with different renewal cycles. Ensure the covenant does not inadvertently require Seller to maintain coverage that becomes unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Florida:** Citizens Property Insurance Corporation may be the only available windstorm insurer. Ensure the covenant accommodates the possibility that coverage may change upon Citizens' policy renewal.
- **California:** Earthquake insurance is typically not carried. Ensure the covenant does not require Seller to obtain earthquake coverage that was not in place as of the Effective Date.

## Leasing Restrictions — Consent Standards

### Preferred Position

Seller should retain maximum leasing flexibility during the interim period. During the due diligence period, Seller should have unrestricted leasing authority. After due diligence expires, Seller should be able to continue leasing with Buyer's consent, but the consent standard should be "not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed" — not Buyer's "sole and absolute discretion." Deemed approval should apply with a short response period (3-5 Business Days). Seller should be permitted to honor all tenant-initiated rights (options, renewals, ROFO/ROFR) without Buyer consent.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Seller Side, Section 7.2):**

> "Seller shall not enter into any new leases or amendments to any current Lease nor waive performance of any Tenant's obligations under its Lease without Purchaser's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing of its disapproval with an explanation of its objections thereto set forth in reasonable detail within 5 Business Days of Purchaser's receipt of a copy of the proposed lease or lease modification, or Purchaser shall be deemed to have approved the same."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The consent standard should be "not unreasonably withheld" — never "sole and absolute discretion." The IL Pro-Buyer form's "sole and absolute discretion" standard (Section 12.01(b)(i)) is unacceptable because it gives Buyer an arbitrary veto over Seller's leasing program and can cause Seller to lose prospective tenants during the interim period.
- The deemed-approval period should be as short as commercially feasible: 3 Business Days is ideal; 5 Business Days is market; resist anything longer than 7 Business Days.
- The Meadows form (Section 6.1) provides that the leasing restriction begins only "three (3) [days] the end of the Property Approval Period" — this delays the onset of the consent requirement and gives Seller more flexibility during the early interim period. This is Seller-favorable.
- The Meadows form also includes two important Seller protections: (a) Seller is not required to obtain Buyer's consent if Seller is "contractually obligated to take such action under the terms of any such Lease, Contract or Permit"; and (b) Seller may enter into new contracts without consent if the contract is "necessary as a result of an emergency" and "terminable upon not more than thirty (30) calendar days' notice without penalty."
- The PSA - Seller (income property) form (Section 8(a)) provides: "During the Due Diligence Period, Seller shall continue to maintain, operate, and lease the Property in the same manner." This is the cleanest unrestricted leasing authority during due diligence.
- Leasing cost allocation: Seller should ensure that all leasing costs for new leases approved by Buyer are allocated to Buyer at closing. Both UNICO forms (Section 7.3.3) provide that Buyer bears "New Leasing Costs" for any new leases entered after the Due Diligence Deadline that have been approved or deemed approved by Buyer.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer needs to control the leasing program because any new lease directly affects Buyer's underwriting, cash flow projections, and lender approval. Buyer will push for "sole and absolute discretion" and longer response periods.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Maintain "not unreasonably withheld" as the standard. Offer to define "reasonable" with reference to market-rate terms, creditworthy tenants, and uses consistent with the existing tenant mix.
2. If Buyer insists on a stricter standard for certain lease types, accept "sole discretion" only for: (a) leases with an initial term exceeding 15 years, (b) leases involving more than 25% of the building's rentable area, or (c) leases involving an affiliated party of Seller.
3. Accept 5 Business Days as the response period (rather than 3), but insist on the deemed-approval mechanism with a conspicuous notice requirement flowing to Buyer.
4. If Buyer insists on longer response periods for specific lease types (major tenants, anchor leases), accept 7 Business Days for leases above a specified square footage threshold, with 5 Business Days for all others.
5. If Buyer insists on pre-approved "leasing parameters," negotiate parameters that are broad enough to capture the majority of anticipated leasing activity: rent within 10% of asking, TI within 15% of budget, standard term lengths, standard use clauses.
6. Resist any requirement for Buyer's consent to tenant-initiated option exercises (renewals, expansions, ROFO/ROFR). These are contractual obligations under existing Leases and cannot be conditioned on a third party's consent.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Overly restrictive leasing covenants can cause Seller to lose prospective tenants during the interim period, reducing the property's occupancy and value. If Buyer withholds consent unreasonably (or simply fails to respond, in the absence of a deemed-approval provision), Seller may suffer real economic harm with limited recourse. Conversely, if Seller enters into a below-market lease without proper consent, it creates a closing condition failure and potential default.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Leasing cycles are long; losing a prospective tenant during the interim period may not be recoverable. Push for maximum leasing flexibility. Accept deemed approval at 5 Business Days.
- **Industrial:** Leasing velocity is high; prospective tenants often have short decision timelines. Push for 3-Business-Day deemed approval.
- **Retail:** Leasing is the most complex due to use restrictions, co-tenancy, and exclusives. Accept 5-7 Business Days for retail leases, with leasing parameters pre-approved for inline spaces.
- **Multifamily:** Standard apartment leases should be exempt from the consent requirement entirely (or subject to pre-approved parameters). Consent should only be required for non-standard terms, commercial spaces, or bulk leases below minimum rent.
- **Data Center:** Accept longer response periods (7-10 Business Days) given the technical complexity, but insist on "not unreasonably withheld" standard.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Courts enforce consent standards strictly as written. If the standard is "not unreasonably withheld," New York courts will apply an objective reasonableness test. This generally favors Seller if the proposed lease is on market terms.
- **California:** The implied covenant of good faith may expand a "not unreasonably withheld" standard to require Buyer to act in good faith, which is generally Seller-favorable.

## New Lease Approval Mechanics — Deemed Approval

### Preferred Position

The deemed-approval mechanism is essential for Seller. If Buyer does not respond within the specified period, Buyer should be conclusively deemed to have approved the proposed lease or amendment. The response period should be as short as commercially feasible (3-5 Business Days). Seller should not be required to provide a "conspicuous notice" or any special formatting — a standard notice with a copy of the proposed lease should suffice.

**Preferred sample language (derived from PSA - Seller (income property), Section 8(a)):**

> "Buyer's consent shall conclusively be deemed granted if Buyer does not object to a proposed new lease, lease modification or lease termination within five (5) days after Seller has provided Buyer with a written request for approval, together with a copy of the documents for which approval is sought."

### Key Negotiation Points

- "Conclusively deemed" is stronger than "deemed" — it prevents Buyer from later arguing that the approval was not effective.
- Resist any exception to deemed approval for "Major Tenants" or leases above a square footage threshold. If the deemed-approval mechanism has exceptions, Seller risks an indefinite delay on its largest and most important leasing transactions.
- Resist requirements to provide tenant financial statements, brokerage agreements, or rent comps as a condition precedent to the deemed-approval period commencing. The Seller should only be required to deliver a copy of the proposed lease — not a complete underwriting package.
- The PSA - Seller (income property) form (Section 8(a)) requires only "a written request for approval, together with a copy of the documents for which approval is sought." This is the cleanest Seller formulation.
- The UNICO forms (both sides) require that Buyer explain its objections "in reasonable detail." This is a useful Seller protection — it prevents Buyer from issuing a bare "disapproval" without explanation, which would frustrate the leasing process.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer needs sufficient time and information to evaluate proposed leases. Buyer will push for longer response periods, more complete submissions, and exceptions for major leases.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept 5 Business Days (rather than 3) as the standard response period, but resist anything longer.
2. Accept a requirement to deliver the proposed lease plus a summary of material economic terms, but resist requirements for tenant financials, rent comps, or brokerage agreements.
3. If Buyer insists on a Major Tenant exception, accept it but define "Major Tenant" narrowly (only specifically named tenants, not square footage thresholds) and provide that the response period for Major Tenant leases is 7 Business Days (not unlimited).
4. If Buyer insists on a "conspicuous notice" requirement, accept a subject-line requirement for email notices (e.g., "LEASE APPROVAL REQUEST — DEEMED APPROVAL APPLIES") rather than a separate notice provision.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — The absence of a deemed-approval provision — or one with broad exceptions — can effectively give Buyer a veto over Seller's leasing program. An unresponsive Buyer can paralyze leasing activity during the interim period.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The deemed-approval mechanic is substantially similar across asset types. The response period may vary (shorter for industrial/multifamily, longer for retail/data center).

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Deemed-approval provisions are generally enforceable as a matter of contract law. Ensure the notice triggering the deemed-approval period complies with the PSA's general notice provision.

## Service Contracts — Flexibility for Ongoing Operations

### Preferred Position

Seller should retain the ability to enter into service contracts necessary for the continuing operation, maintenance, and repair of the Property, provided such contracts are cancelable upon 30 days' notice at no cost to Buyer. Consent should be required only for long-term or non-cancelable contracts. Seller should have the right (but not the obligation) to terminate non-assumed contracts at or before closing, with Buyer bearing termination costs for any contracts Buyer rejects that cannot be terminated without penalty.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Seller Side, Section 8.3):**

> "Seller shall not enter into any additional service contracts or other similar agreements or amend any of the Assumed Contracts without the prior consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed; provided, however, Seller may enter into such service contracts and other similar agreements (a) that Seller reasonably determines are appropriate for the continuing operation, maintenance, and repair of the Property, (b) which are cancelable on not more than 30 days' notice at no cost to Purchaser, and (c) as to which all amounts owing thereunder have been or shall be paid by Seller unless they become an Assumed Contract."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The 30-day cancelable exception is Seller's essential carve-out. This permits Seller to engage emergency contractors, replace departing vendors, and respond to operational needs without seeking Buyer consent for every routine contract.
- The Meadows form (Section 6.1) includes both the emergency and 30-day cancelable exceptions. This is the minimum Seller should accept.
- Ensure the definition of "Contracts" does not inadvertently include purchase orders, work authorizations, or other short-term operational commitments. The UNICO definition (Section 8.1) covers "management, leasing, brokerage, maintenance, construction and service contracts" — this should exclude routine purchase orders.
- Seller should not be obligated to terminate contracts that it cannot terminate without penalty. The UNICO Seller Side (Section 8.2) provides that Seller terminates "Disapproved Contracts" — but the termination right is limited to contracts "that Seller under the express terms of such Contracts is able to terminate on or before Closing at no cost or expense to Seller."
- The existing property management agreement should be terminable at closing without penalty. If there is a termination fee, the PSA should allocate it (typically Seller's expense).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer should designate which contracts to assume, and Seller should terminate all others at Seller's cost. Buyer may seek "sole discretion" consent for any new contracts.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept Buyer's right to designate assumed contracts by the Due Diligence Deadline. Resist any extension of this deadline.
2. Accept that Seller terminates non-assumed contracts, but limit Seller's obligation to contracts that are terminable under their express terms at no cost to Seller. For non-terminable contracts, Buyer either assumes them or bears the termination cost.
3. Accept "not unreasonably withheld" for all new contracts, with the 30-day cancelable exception intact.
4. If Buyer insists on "sole discretion" for certain contracts, limit it to management agreements and brokerage agreements (which have the greatest impact on Buyer's post-closing operations).

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — An overly restrictive service contract covenant can hamper Seller's ability to maintain the property. If Seller cannot engage emergency contractors or replace departed vendors without Buyer consent, property condition may deteriorate — paradoxically creating a potential maintenance covenant breach.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Resist restrictions on janitorial, security, and parking management contracts, which may need to be adjusted in the ordinary course.
- **Industrial:** Minimal contract exposure. Standard formulation is generally adequate.
- **Retail:** CAM-related contracts (marketing, landscaping, snow removal) may need mid-year adjustments. Ensure the 30-day cancelable exception covers these.
- **Data Center:** Accept that infrastructure maintenance contracts (generator, UPS, fire suppression) require Buyer consent for amendments, but insist on the emergency exception.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Service contract termination is governed by the contract terms, not by real estate law. Verify terminability before agreeing to terminate.

---

## No Voluntary Encumbrances — Seller's Position

### Preferred Position

Seller should accept a covenant not to voluntarily encumber the Property after the Effective Date, but the covenant should be limited to voluntary, affirmative acts by Seller. Seller should not be responsible for involuntary encumbrances (mechanic's liens filed by contractors, judgment liens, tax liens) provided Seller uses reasonable efforts to discharge them before closing. The consent standard should be "not unreasonably withheld" (not "sole and absolute discretion"), with carve-outs for utility easements, minor encumbrances required by governmental authorities, and encumbrances required under existing agreements.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Seller shall not voluntarily subject the Property to any additional material liens, encumbrances, covenants, or easements without Buyer's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The foregoing shall not apply to (a) liens, encumbrances, or easements required by any governmental authority, (b) utility easements that do not materially impair the value, use, or operation of the Property, (c) mechanic's liens or other involuntary liens, provided Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to discharge the same prior to Closing, and (d) any Lease or Contract entered into in accordance with the leasing and contract provisions of this Agreement."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Resist "sole and absolute discretion." The IL Pro-Buyer form's absolute prohibition (Section 12.01(b)(v)-(vii)) is unacceptable for Seller because it gives Buyer an arbitrary veto over any title matter.
- Include the involuntary lien carve-out. Mechanic's liens filed by disgruntled contractors are outside Seller's control. Seller should commit to "commercially reasonable efforts" to discharge, not an absolute obligation.
- Include the utility easement carve-out. Minor utility easements may be required for ongoing tenant improvements or by the utility company. These are typically title-insurable and do not impair value.
- Include the governmental requirement carve-out. Governmental agencies may require easements or restrictions as a condition of permits or approvals.
- The Meadows form does not contain a stand-alone encumbrance restriction — this is advantageous for Seller, as the absence of a specific covenant gives Seller more flexibility.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Any new encumbrance impairs Buyer's title and may not be acceptable to Buyer's lender. Buyer needs absolute protection against new liens and encumbrances.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a stronger standard for mortgages, deed restrictions, and ground leases (sole discretion or absolute prohibition), while retaining "not unreasonably withheld" for minor encumbrances.
2. Accept that Seller will indemnify Buyer for any damage caused by a voluntary encumbrance recorded without Buyer's consent.
3. Accept an obligation to discharge involuntary liens at or before closing (rather than "commercially reasonable efforts"), but with a dollar cap above which Seller may elect to terminate the agreement rather than pay.
4. Accept that the encumbrance covenant extends to Seller's "action or inaction," but carve out involuntary liens arising from third-party actions.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW-MEDIUM** — For institutional sellers, voluntary encumbrances during the interim period are unusual. The primary risk is an inadvertent breach caused by a mechanic's lien or a utility easement recorded without Seller's direct involvement.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Substantially similar. Data center properties may require new fiber or utility easements more frequently — ensure the carve-out is broad enough.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **California, Texas, other mechanic's lien states:** Mechanic's liens may relate back to the commencement of work, creating priority issues even if the lien is recorded after closing. Seller should offer to provide lien waivers from all contractors at closing, which typically satisfies both Buyer and title company.
- **New York:** Lis pendens may be filed in connection with litigation and constitutes an encumbrance. The covenant should address lis pendens separately if there is pending litigation.

---

## No Material Alterations — Seller's Flexibility

### Preferred Position

Seller should accept a general restriction on material alterations, but with sufficient flexibility to complete ongoing work, perform tenant improvements under existing leases, and address emergency conditions. The consent standard should be "not unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed," with a clear dollar threshold for what constitutes "material."

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Seller Side, Section 9.2):**

> "Seller shall not make any material alterations to the Property without Purchaser's prior written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Define "material" with a dollar threshold. Seller should propose $50,000-$100,000 per occurrence as the threshold below which no consent is required. This allows Seller to make ordinary repairs and maintenance without approval for each expenditure.
- The IL Pro-Buyer form's absolute prohibition on capital improvements except emergencies (Section 12.01(b)) is unacceptable for Seller. Seller needs the ability to complete tenant improvements under existing leases, address building code requirements, and respond to operational needs.
- Insist on carve-outs for: (a) work required under existing Leases (TI obligations, landlord repair obligations), (b) emergency repairs, (c) work required by governmental authorities or building codes, and (d) work in progress as of the Effective Date.
- For TI work in progress, the PSA - Seller (income property) form (Section 9(g)) provides an escrow holdback mechanism. Seller should accept this structure, as it allows Seller to receive credit for completed work and limits exposure to the escrow amount.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer needs to know that the Property will not be physically changed before closing in ways that affect value or operations.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a $50,000 threshold (buyer will push for $25,000) with consent required above the threshold.
2. Accept that consent is required for work affecting structural elements or building systems (HVAC, electrical, plumbing, elevators), even if below the dollar threshold.
3. Accept an emergency exception that requires Seller to notify Buyer within 24-48 hours (but not to obtain prior consent).
4. Accept that Buyer has inspection rights over completed work before closing.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — For institutional sellers, material unauthorized alterations during the interim period are uncommon. The primary risk is an overbroad covenant that restricts Seller's ability to complete ordinary TI work or emergency repairs.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Seller may have ongoing TI construction. Ensure the carve-out for work under existing Leases is broad enough to cover all lease-mandated TI obligations.
- **Data Center:** Seller may need to perform infrastructure work (power upgrades, cooling modifications) to support existing tenants. Ensure the carve-out covers infrastructure work required under existing Leases or SLAs.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** No state-specific considerations for alteration restrictions. The standard is contractual.

---

## Tenant Improvement and Leasing Cost Allocation

### Preferred Position

Seller should receive a credit at closing for all tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions paid by Seller between the Effective Date and Closing for leases that Buyer approved or was deemed to have approved. Existing leasing cost obligations as of the Effective Date should be disclosed, and Buyer should receive a credit for unpaid obligations — but Seller should not be required to pre-fund or escrow more than the actual remaining cost.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Seller Side, Section 7.3):**

> "Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of all Leasing Costs payable for (a) any new Leases entered into after the Due Diligence Deadline that have been approved (or deemed approved) by Buyer, and (b) the renewal, expansion or extension of the Leases existing as of the Due Diligence Deadline and exercised or effected after the Due Diligence Deadline."

### Key Negotiation Points

- New Leasing Costs should be allocated entirely to Buyer. Both UNICO forms agree on this. This is market for institutional transactions.
- For Existing Leasing Costs, Seller should deliver a credit at closing equal to the unpaid balance. Resist escrow holdbacks with contingency buffers — these lock up Seller's proceeds and create post-closing administrative burden.
- Require Buyer to assume responsibility for paying the remaining Existing Leasing Costs to the extent of the credit received. This ensures Seller is not liable for TI obligations after closing.
- For in-process TI work, Seller should have the option to complete the work before closing or credit the remaining balance. If an escrow is used (PSA - Seller form, Section 9(g)), excess funds should be returned to Seller.
- Resist any present-value discounting of TI obligations. Buyer should receive a dollar-for-dollar credit (not an inflated present-value credit) for outstanding TI obligations.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Existing Leasing Costs should be fully credited at closing (including any contingency for cost overruns), and Buyer should not bear costs for TI work that was Seller's obligation under pre-existing leases.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a dollar-for-dollar credit for all outstanding Existing Leasing Costs as of closing (this is market).
2. Accept an escrow holdback for in-process TI work (rather than a direct credit), but cap the contingency at 5% (Buyer will push for 10-15%).
3. Accept that Buyer bears New Leasing Costs, but require Buyer to provide evidence that Seller's paid leasing costs are correct before Seller receives reimbursement.
4. If Buyer insists on present-value discounting, accept it only for obligations with commencement dates more than 24 months post-closing (not 12 months, as Buyer will propose).

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — Incorrect allocation of leasing costs is a frequent source of post-closing disputes. Seller should ensure the Existing Leasing Costs schedule is complete and accurate; any omissions may result in uncredited costs that Seller cannot recover after closing.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Largest TI exposure. Ensure all outstanding TI obligations are on the schedule, including those for future option exercises with known TI commitments.
- **Retail:** Tenant allowances may include construction allowances, signage credits, and exclusive-use compliance costs. Ensure these are captured.
- **Data Center:** High-dollar infrastructure costs may be classified as TI. Clarify what constitutes a "Leasing Cost" versus a capital improvement.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Leasing cost allocation is contractual and not governed by specific state law.

## Delinquent Rent Pursuit — Seller's Rights

### Preferred Position

Seller should retain the right to collect all pre-closing delinquent rents after closing, including the right to pursue legal claims directly against tenants (subject to a prohibition on lease termination or eviction). Post-closing rent collections should be applied to Seller's delinquencies first (or at least on an equal-priority basis with Buyer's claims), and Buyer should be required to bill tenants for delinquent rents for a reasonable period after closing and remit Seller's share promptly.

**Preferred sample language (derived from PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side), Section 8.4(c)):**

> "Delinquent Rent shall not be accrued or prorated at Closing. Any Delinquent Rent that is paid after the Closing Date shall be paid to Seller. Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to collect any Delinquent Rent after the Closing, provided that Purchaser shall not be required to commence any legal proceedings or terminate any Lease. Following the Closing, Seller shall have the right to pursue claims against any Tenant or other party for sums due with respect to periods prior to the Closing; provided that Seller shall not be permitted to commence or pursue any legal proceedings against any tenant seeking eviction of such Tenant or the termination of such Tenant's Lease."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The rent application waterfall is critical for Seller. The most Seller-favorable waterfall applies collections to delinquent rents first (before current month), since once a tenant is current with Buyer, Buyer has less incentive to collect Seller's arrearages. The PSA form (Section 8.4(f)) uses a priority system: (i) closing month, (ii) following month (Buyer), (iii) preceding month (Seller), (iv) later periods (Buyer), (v) earlier periods (Seller). This is Seller-unfavorable because Buyer's current and future rent takes priority.
- The UNICO Seller Side waterfall (Section 7.5) applies: (a) first to closing month, (b) second to Buyer's period, (c) third to Seller's period. This is also Buyer-favorable.
- Seller should push for: (a) first to closing month (split pro rata), (b) second to Seller's delinquent rents, (c) third to Buyer's post-closing period. This reflects the reality that Seller cannot control Buyer's collection efforts.
- Seller should retain the unfettered right to pursue tenants directly for pre-closing delinquencies (subject to the no-eviction restriction). Both UNICO forms and the PSA form preserve this right.
- Buyer should not be permitted to waive or modify delinquent rents owed to Seller, or to amend any Lease to reduce amounts owed to Seller, without Seller's consent. The PSA form (Section 8.4(c)) includes this protection.
- Require Buyer to furnish Seller with periodic reporting of rent collections and to allow Seller to audit Buyer's rental records. The PSA form (Section 8.4(f)) provides for both.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Current rent owed to Buyer should always take priority over Seller's delinquencies, since Buyer is the one operating the property and has ongoing obligations. Buyer will also argue it should have no obligation to actively collect Seller's arrearages.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept the UNICO waterfall (closing month first, then Buyer, then Seller) as the standard — this is market.
2. Accept that Buyer's billing obligation is limited to "ordinary course" billing for 6 months — not litigation or collection agencies. This is market.
3. Insist on Seller's retained right to pursue tenants directly (subject to no-eviction restriction).
4. Insist on the anti-waiver provision: Buyer may not reduce or waive delinquent amounts owed to Seller without Seller's consent.
5. Accept quarterly (rather than monthly) reporting of rent collections.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — Pre-closing delinquent rents are a known asset at signing. The risk is that Buyer fails to collect or remit Seller's share, or that Buyer amends leases to forgive arrearages. The contractual protections (anti-waiver, audit right, direct collection right) are Seller's primary tools.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** Higher delinquency risk, including percentage rent disputes. Ensure Seller's collection right extends to percentage rent and CAM reconciliation adjustments.
- **Multifamily:** High volume of small-balance delinquencies. Accept streamlined reporting and limited collection obligations.
- **Office/Industrial:** Lower delinquency risk for investment-grade tenants.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Rent application provisions are contractual. No state-specific override.

## Cooperation with Buyer's Lender — Seller's Limitations

### Preferred Position

Seller should cooperate with Buyer's financing efforts, but only to the extent such cooperation is (a) at no cost or expense to Seller, (b) does not require Seller to make any representations or warranties to Buyer's lender, (c) does not require Seller to modify any existing loan documents, and (d) does not extend the Closing Date. Buyer's ability to obtain financing should expressly not be a condition to closing.

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Seller Side, Section 9.3 — identical to Buyer Side):**

> "At no cost or expense to Seller, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser's efforts to obtain financing for its acquisition of the Property. Such cooperation shall include requesting financial information, estoppel certificates and/or SNDAs from the Tenants, enforcing such requirements for estoppel certificates and SNDAs to the extent the same may be required under the Leases, and allowing the lender's consultants to inspect the Property. It is understood and agreed that Purchaser's ability to obtain financing for the acquisition of the Property is not a condition to Purchaser's obligation to close."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The "at no cost or expense to Seller" limitation is essential. Seller should not be required to pay for tenant SNDA negotiations, lender inspections, or legal fees related to Buyer's financing.
- Seller should not be required to provide representations, warranties, or indemnities to Buyer's lender. The UNICO forms do not require this.
- Seller's cooperation should be "reasonable" — not unlimited. Seller should not be required to divert significant management time to Buyer's financing process.
- Confirm that financing is not a closing condition. Both UNICO forms (Buyer and Seller sides) include this express statement. The absence of a financing contingency is a hallmark of institutional commercial real estate transactions.
- If Buyer is assuming Seller's existing loan, the cooperation obligations are different and more extensive. Negotiate these in a separate assumption section of the PSA.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer needs Seller's active cooperation to obtain financing, including providing historical financial statements, executing estoppel certificates, and negotiating SNDAs with tenants.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept cooperation obligations as stated in the UNICO forms. This is market and balanced.
2. Accept that Seller will request estoppels and SNDAs from tenants, and will enforce estoppel requirements to the extent available under the Leases. Resist any obligation to litigate against tenants to obtain estoppels.
3. Accept that Seller will provide historical financial statements and operating data, but only to the extent already in Seller's possession — no obligation to create new reports or engage accountants.
4. Accept that lender consultants may inspect the Property under the same terms as Buyer's due diligence inspections.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — The cooperation obligation is generally non-controversial and low-cost for Seller. The key risk is scope creep: if the obligation is vague, Buyer's lender may make increasingly burdensome requests during the closing process.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Substantially similar. The number and complexity of tenant SNDAs is the primary variable.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** No state-specific considerations for lender cooperation.

## Cooperation with Buyer's Due Diligence — Seller's Protections

### Preferred Position

Seller should provide reasonable access for inspections during business hours with advance notice, but should retain protections against: (a) tenant disruption, (b) damage to the Property, (c) invasive or destructive testing without specific consent, and (d) disclosure of confidential Seller information. Buyer should indemnify Seller for any damage or liability arising from Buyer's inspections.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Require advance notice for inspections: 24-48 hours for non-invasive inspections, 5 Business Days for Phase II environmental or destructive testing.
- Require Buyer to carry specified insurance coverages ($1M-$2M CGL, naming Seller as additional insured) as a condition to access.
- Buyer should indemnify Seller for any damage to the Property or injury to persons caused by Buyer's inspections. This indemnity should survive termination.
- The UNICO forms (Section 3.4.2) provide that "Buyer and Buyer's Due Diligence Team shall conduct the Inspections in a manner which is not disruptive to Tenants and does not interfere with the normal operation of the Property."
- Seller should retain the right to have a representative present during inspections.
- Buyer should agree to restore the Property to its prior condition if any invasive testing is conducted.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

These provisions are generally agreed without significant negotiation. The main point of contention is the scope of invasive testing and whether Seller can refuse Phase II environmental testing.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept that Phase II testing requires Seller's specific consent, but agree that consent will not be unreasonably withheld if Phase I identifies recognized environmental conditions.
2. Accept after-hours access for non-disruptive inspections (e.g., MEP inspections) with 48 hours' notice.
3. Accept that Buyer's indemnity excludes pre-existing conditions discovered (but not caused) by Buyer's inspections.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Inspection-related damage is uncommon but can occur with environmental testing (bore holes, soil sampling). The indemnity obligation is Seller's primary protection.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Data Center:** Strict access controls are justified. Require Buyer's consultants to sign NDAs and comply with facility security protocols.
- **Industrial:** Environmental testing is common and often extensive. Ensure Seller has consent rights and restoration obligations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Inspection access and indemnification are contractual. No state-specific considerations.

## Notice of Material Events — Seller's Limitations

### Preferred Position

Seller should agree to notify Buyer of material events, but the notice obligation should be qualified by actual knowledge (no duty of inquiry), limited to material events (not all correspondence), and should extend only to Seller's own knowledge (not the knowledge of all agents and contractors).

**Preferred sample language (derived from UNICO Seller Side, Section 9.1):**

> "Between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, Seller shall notify or shall cause its property manager to notify Purchaser of any written notice received by Seller or its property manager of any of the following matters promptly after Seller or its property manager has knowledge of such matter: notices of default or disputes from any Tenant, notices of disputes involving any Assumed Contract, condemnation, environmental, zoning or other land-use regulation proceedings specifically relating to the Property, notice of any violations of any laws specifically relating to the Property, and any litigation or notice of any claim relating to the Property."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Limit the knowledge standard to Seller and its property manager — not all agents, consultants, brokers, or employees.
- Require only written notices to be forwarded — not oral communications, rumors, or informal complaints.
- "Promptly" is sufficient — resist specific day counts (e.g., "within 2 Business Days") which create technical default risk if an event occurs during a holiday or weekend.
- Resist a catch-all requirement to notify Buyer of "any event that would make any Seller representation untrue." This effectively converts every representation into an ongoing monitoring obligation and creates significant compliance burden.
- The UNICO Seller Side language is well-calibrated: it covers the key categories (tenant defaults, contract disputes, governmental proceedings, litigation) without imposing an unlimited monitoring obligation.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer needs comprehensive, timely notice to protect its investment and exercise its rights under the PSA.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept the UNICO categories as the baseline (these are comprehensive). Resist adding "any event that would make any Seller representation untrue."
2. Accept that the notice obligation extends to Seller's property manager (this is reasonable and already in the UNICO language).
3. If Buyer insists on the "representation untrue" catch-all, accept it but qualify it with "to Seller's actual knowledge" and "material."
4. Accept "promptly" as the timing standard. If a specific day count is required, 5 Business Days (not 2) is reasonable.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW-MEDIUM** — An overbroad notice obligation creates compliance risk: if Seller fails to forward a piece of tenant correspondence that later turns out to be material, Buyer could argue a covenant breach. Keep the obligation reasonable and specific.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Substantially similar. For multifamily properties with high volumes of tenant correspondence, limit the notice obligation to written notices of default, litigation, and governmental proceedings — not routine maintenance requests.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Notice provisions are contractual. No state-specific considerations.

## No Voluntary Zoning Changes — Seller's Carve-Outs

### Preferred Position

Seller should accept a restriction on voluntary zoning changes, but should retain the right to continue processing any governmental applications that were pending as of the Effective Date and to respond to governmental inquiries or requirements.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Accept the general prohibition on zoning changes, land use applications, and permit modifications. This is market.
- Insist on a carve-out for pending applications disclosed on a schedule.
- Insist on the right to respond to governmental inquiries and comply with governmental requirements.
- The PSA - Seller (income property) form does not include a stand-alone zoning restriction — it is subsumed within the general operating covenant. This is Seller-favorable.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

These provisions are generally agreed quickly. The main negotiation is the scope of the carve-out for pending applications.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Zoning changes during the interim period are extremely unlikely for an institutional seller disposing of stabilized property.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Substantially similar.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** No state-specific considerations.

## Employee Matters — Seller's Protections

### Preferred Position

Seller should have no obligation to retain or terminate any employees in connection with the transaction. Buyer should expressly acknowledge that it has no obligation to hire Seller's employees and that Seller (or its property manager) retains full control over employment decisions through closing. Seller's indemnification, if any, should be limited to employees directly employed by Seller (not by third-party property managers).

### Key Negotiation Points

- Most institutional sellers employ no property-level staff directly — the property manager employs on-site personnel. The PSA should clearly state that Buyer has no obligation to hire any employees and is not assuming any employment obligations.
- If Seller does employ property-level staff, Seller should retain full control over employment decisions through closing, including the right to terminate employees as part of the disposition process.
- WARN Act compliance: Seller should verify headcount and determine whether the WARN Act or any state mini-WARN law applies. If it does, Seller should provide 60 days' notice before any mass layoff. The PSA should not create an independent WARN obligation beyond what the statute requires.
- Resist an indemnification obligation that extends to property manager employees. Seller does not control the employment relationship between the property manager and its employees.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer needs protection against WARN Act claims and wants Seller to indemnify against all pre-closing employment claims.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept indemnification for employees directly employed by Seller or its affiliates.
2. Accept a covenant to comply with the WARN Act and applicable state mini-WARN laws.
3. Resist indemnification for property manager employees. Instead, require that the property management agreement contains its own WARN compliance and indemnification provisions.
4. If Buyer insists on a broad indemnification, accept it with a time limitation (24 months post-closing) and a dollar cap.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW-MEDIUM** — WARN Act exposure is real but manageable with proper planning. The typical 30-90 day closing timeline provides adequate time to issue WARN notices if required.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily/Retail:** Higher headcount means greater WARN exposure. Plan for 60-day notice if applicable.
- **Office/Industrial:** Lower headcount; WARN is less likely to apply.
- **Data Center:** Specialized staff may have contractual notice or severance provisions. Verify before committing to employment covenants.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois:** State mini-WARN laws have lower employee thresholds and/or longer notice periods than the federal WARN Act. Verify compliance.

---

## Tax Protest Continuation — Seller's Control

### Preferred Position

Seller should retain control of all tax protests and appeals relating to its period of ownership. Seller should not be required to continue protests beyond the Closing Date at Seller's expense. Any tax refunds should be allocated between Seller and Buyer based on periods of ownership, with Seller retaining refunds for its period.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Seller should retain the right to settle or withdraw tax protests relating to Seller's period of ownership. Requiring Buyer's consent for settlement restricts Seller's post-closing flexibility.
- Tax refunds should be allocated based on the tax periods to which they relate, not the date of receipt. Seller should receive refunds for tax periods ending before closing.
- Any tenant reimbursement obligations relating to tax refunds should be honored. The PSA form (Section 8.4(d)) provides that refunds are first applied to unreimbursed costs, then to tenants, then allocated between Seller and Buyer.
- Seller should not be required to file new tax protests at Buyer's request. If Buyer wants protests filed, Buyer should file them post-closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Tax protests affect future assessments and should be controlled jointly. Buyer will want consent rights over settlement.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a consultation requirement: Seller will consult with Buyer before settling any protest relating to the year in which closing occurs.
2. Accept that Buyer may, at its own expense, participate in protests relating to the closing year.
3. Resist consent requirements for protests relating solely to Seller's period of ownership (pre-closing years).
4. Accept joint control of the closing-year protest with costs shared proportionally.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Tax protest disputes are typically resolved through post-closing adjustments and do not affect the closing itself.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Substantially similar. Higher-value properties have larger tax protest exposure.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **California (Proposition 13):** Reassessment upon change of ownership is mandatory. Pre-closing tax protests (Proposition 8 decline-in-value claims) may be mooted by the reassessment. Seller should retain control of any refund relating to its ownership period.
- **Texas:** Annual tax protests are common and expected. Ensure Seller has filed for the current year and retains control.
- **New York:** Certiorari proceedings may take years to resolve. The PSA should address the allocation of refunds for multi-year proceedings.
- **Illinois (Cook County):** Triennial reassessment system. Verify assessment cycle timing relative to closing.

---

## Books and Records — Seller's Limited Obligations

### Preferred Position

Seller should deliver copies of relevant books and records at or before closing, but should have no obligation to maintain original records after closing beyond what is required by law. Seller's record retention obligation should be limited to 12 months after closing.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Deliver copies of operating statements, general ledgers, tenant files, and vendor contracts at closing. Originals may remain with Seller.
- Seller's obligation to prepare reconciliation statements should be limited to the year immediately preceding closing. The UNICO Seller Side (Section 7.7) requires Seller to prepare reconciliation statements for the calendar year preceding closing — this is market.
- Resist post-closing retention obligations exceeding 12 months. Records are voluminous and expensive to store.
- Resist obligations to cooperate with Buyer's accountants in preparing transfer-year financials. Seller should deliver the data; Buyer's accountants should prepare the statements.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer needs 24-36 months of record retention for post-closing adjustments and audit.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept 18-month retention (compromise between 12 and 24).
2. Accept that Seller will make records available for inspection (not deliver copies) during the retention period.
3. Accept cooperation with Buyer's accountants for the reconciliation year, but limit to providing data already in Seller's possession.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Record retention disputes rarely arise in practice. The primary risk is an overbroad obligation that creates administrative burden for Seller after closing.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office/Retail:** Complex operating expense reconciliations require detailed records. Accept longer retention for these property types.
- **Industrial (NNN):** Minimal reconciliation complexity. Shorter retention is acceptable.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** No state-specific requirements for records retention between parties in commercial property transactions.

---

## Buyer's Pre-Closing Covenants — Confidentiality (Seller's Enforcement)

### Preferred Position

Buyer should be bound by a robust confidentiality obligation covering all due diligence materials, financial information, and transaction terms. The confidentiality covenant should survive termination of the agreement and should include a specific remedy provision (injunctive relief) given the difficulty of proving monetary damages for confidentiality breaches.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Standard carve-outs for Buyer's lender, investors, attorneys, and accountants are acceptable, but Buyer should be responsible for its disclosees' compliance.
- Include an injunctive relief provision: "Seller shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity."
- Require return or destruction of due diligence materials upon termination.
- If the agreement is terminated, confidentiality should survive for 24 months.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

These provisions are generally agreed quickly. Buyer may resist the return/destruction obligation for practical reasons (materials are widely distributed among consultants).

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Confidentiality breaches are uncommon in institutional transactions. The covenant is primarily a deterrent.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Substantially similar.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Confidentiality agreements are governed by general contract law. Injunctive relief provisions are generally enforceable.

---

## Buyer's Pre-Closing Covenants — Transition Cooperation

### Preferred Position

Buyer should cooperate with Seller on transition matters, including 1031 exchange cooperation, utility transfers, and tenant notification letters. Buyer's cooperation should be "at no cost or expense to Seller."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The UNICO forms (Section 16.7) include a mutual 1031 exchange cooperation provision. This is market and appropriate.
- Coordinate on the tenant notification letter — this should be a joint letter from Seller and Buyer delivered at or immediately after closing.
- Buyer should cooperate with Seller's post-closing obligations (reconciliation statements, tax protests, delinquent rent collection) for a reasonable period after closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

These provisions are generally non-controversial.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Transition cooperation disputes are rare and typically low-stakes.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Substantially similar.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** No state-specific considerations.
