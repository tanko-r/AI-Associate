# Section 13: Indemnification, Survival, and Liability Limitations -- Seller's Playbook

This section is the seller's primary mechanism for limiting post-closing exposure. In institutional commercial real estate dispositions ($50M+), the seller's objective is to achieve the cleanest possible exit: short survival periods, low liability caps, high basket thresholds, robust anti-sandbagging protections, comprehensive as-is/where-is clauses, and no ongoing indemnification obligations beyond a narrowly circumscribed time window. Every dollar of post-closing liability that survives Closing reduces the certainty and finality of the seller's exit.

## Survival Periods for Representations and Warranties

### Preferred Position

Minimize survival periods across all categories of representations:

- **General representations and warranties**: 6 months from Closing. This is the market-standard seller position in institutional deals, reflected in the UNICO Seller Side form (Section 5.4: "Any cause of action with respect to a breach of the representations and warranties set forth herein shall survive for a period of 6 months from the Closing Date, at which time such representations and warranties (and any cause of action resulting from a breach thereof not then in litigation, including indemnification claims) shall terminate").
- **Fundamental/organizational representations** (authority, due organization, OFAC/AML): Same 6-month period. Resist any attempt to create tiered survival with longer periods for "fundamental" reps.
- **Environmental representations**: Same 6-month period. The as-is clause and environmental release handle environmental risk allocation. Resist extended environmental survival.
- **Tax representations (FIRPTA)**: Same 6-month period. The non-foreign person certificate is a closing deliverable that can be verified at closing. No extended survival is justified.
- **All other representations**: No exceptions, no carve-outs, no tiered periods. A single, uniform survival period is simpler to administer and provides maximum certainty.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 10.4) provides 6 months with a 1% cap -- this is the gold standard for seller protection. The UNICO Seller Side form provides 6 months with a 2.5% cap (Section 5.4). Both are strong seller positions.
- The critical clause is the termination mechanism: "at which time such representations and warranties (and any cause of action resulting from a breach thereof not then in litigation, including indemnification claims) shall terminate." This language means that claims not reduced to litigation within the survival period are extinguished entirely, even if the buyer has delivered a notice of claim.
- Resist buyer attempts to extend survival by requiring only "notice" (not litigation) within the survival period. From the seller's perspective, the buyer should be required to commence a formal legal proceeding within the survival period to preserve the claim. Mere notice should not suffice.
- Resist tolling provisions that freeze the survival period during insurance claims or other processes. Tolling creates open-ended and unpredictable exposure.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: 12-24 months with tiered periods for different rep categories.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. Hold firm at 6 months for all reps. Point to the UNICO Seller Side form and the Detailed Seller PSA as market precedent.
2. If buyer insists on more than 6 months, move to 9 months maximum, with no carve-outs or tiered periods.
3. If buyer demands carve-outs for environmental or fundamental reps, concede 12 months for fundamental reps only (authority, organization, FIRPTA) but hold at 6 months for all others including environmental. The as-is clause handles environmental risk.
4. Never agree to survival periods exceeding 12 months for any representation. Never agree to indefinite survival for any representation (except, potentially, the FIRPTA certificate, which is a statutory requirement).
5. If forced to extend survival, offset by reducing the liability cap, increasing the basket, or strengthening the anti-sandbagging provision.

### Risk Assessment

- **Seller exposure increases linearly with survival length**: Every additional month of survival creates additional time for the buyer to discover (or manufacture) claims. The 6-month period is calibrated to give the buyer one operating quarter plus a buffer, while ensuring the seller can dissolve the SPE and distribute proceeds within a reasonable timeframe.
- Environmental survival beyond 6 months is particularly dangerous because environmental claims are inherently uncertain, potentially massive, and often asserted years after the triggering event.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Industrial**: Buyers will push hardest for extended environmental survival. Resist by emphasizing the thoroughness of Phase I/II assessments, the as-is clause, and the buyer's ability to obtain environmental insurance.
- **Data centers**: Similar to industrial. Resist extended survival for infrastructure-related representations.
- **Office/Retail/Multifamily**: 6 months should be achievable without significant resistance for general reps. Buyers may push harder on lease-related reps given annual reconciliation cycles -- counter that lease information is fully available during diligence.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York**: New York's 6-year contract statute of limitations (CPLR 213(2)) is the background rule. The PSA's 6-month survival provision contractually shortens this period, which New York courts enforce between sophisticated commercial parties.
- **California**: California courts enforce contractual survival limitations. Minimum enforceable limitation period under Cal. CCP 360 is uncertain for contract claims, but 6 months is generally enforced between sophisticated parties. However, include a belt-and-suspenders provision that the parties acknowledge 6 months is "reasonable" to guard against unconscionability challenges.
- **Oregon**: ORS 12.070 prohibits contractual limitation periods shorter than 1 year for certain claims. For Oregon properties (e.g., Meadows), consider a 12-month minimum survival period to ensure enforceability.
- **Delaware**: Relevant for entity-level claims. Delaware enforces contractual survival limitations without minimum periods.
- **Massachusetts/Colorado**: The Detailed Seller PSA (governed by Massachusetts law, Colorado venue) includes 6-month survival. Massachusetts enforces this.
- **Illinois**: Illinois enforces contractual survival limitations. The IL Pro-Buyer Long Form will push for longer periods.

## Survival of Covenants and Indemnification Obligations

### Preferred Position

Strictly limit the covenants that survive Closing to those that are operationally necessary and time-bounded:

- **Post-closing proration adjustments**: Survive for 90 to 180 days maximum. The UNICO forms provide for post-closing true-ups; limit the true-up period to the shortest commercially reasonable timeframe.
- **Annual reconciliation statements**: Seller agrees to prepare prior-year reconciliation statements per the UNICO forms (Section 7.7), but this obligation should terminate upon delivery of the reconciliation statement (with a 30-day correction period).
- **Delinquent rent collection**: Seller retains the right to pursue delinquent rents per the UNICO forms (Section 7.5), but buyer's obligation to bill tenants should be limited to 6 months.
- **Confidentiality**: Survives termination for 12 months per the UNICO Seller Side form (Section 14.4). Terminates upon Closing.
- **Brokerage indemnity**: Survives indefinitely (protects the seller as well as the buyer).
- **Access/inspection indemnity**: Buyer's indemnity for pre-closing site access survives indefinitely per the Meadows form (Section 1.2). This is seller-protective and should be insisted upon.

All other covenants should merge at Closing. The anti-merger clause (UNICO forms, Section 16.18) preserves specified surviving obligations but should be limited by the express terms of the survival provisions.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The anti-merger clause is a double-edged sword for the seller: it preserves seller's surviving rights (e.g., buyer's indemnification obligations) but also preserves buyer's surviving rights (e.g., rep claims). Ensure the anti-merger clause is expressly subject to ("Subject to the limitations set forth in Section [survival provisions]") the negotiated survival limitations. The UNICO forms accomplish this: "Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.4 and Section 14."
- Enumerate the specific obligations that survive Closing in the anti-merger clause. Do not use open-ended language like "all obligations that by their nature survive" -- this invites disputes.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Broad survival of all covenants, including cooperation, further assurances, and tax-related obligations.

**Fallback**: Accept survival of cooperation and further assurance covenants for 12 months post-Closing, but only to the extent "reasonably necessary" and at buyer's expense. Tax cooperation survives through the applicable audit period.

### Risk Assessment

- Open-ended covenant survival creates unpredictable long-tail exposure. The seller's SPE structure assumes a clean exit. Every surviving covenant is a potential impediment to dissolution.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail**: Percentage rent reconciliations may justify slightly longer proration survival (180 days vs. 90 days). Resist anything longer.
- **Office**: Operating expense reconciliation survival of 180 days is market.
- **Industrial**: Simpler operating structures. Proration survival of 90-120 days should suffice.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- The merger doctrine, in the absence of an anti-merger clause, extinguishes all PSA obligations upon delivery of the deed. From the seller's perspective, the anti-merger clause should preserve only those obligations that benefit the seller or that are narrowly and expressly agreed to survive.

---

## Cap on Seller's Aggregate Liability

### Preferred Position

- **Target**: 1% of Purchase Price as the aggregate cap on all post-closing liability. This is the position in the Detailed Seller PSA (Section 10.4: "the total liability of Seller for all such breaches and any matters relating thereto or under any law applicable to the Property or this transaction shall not, in the aggregate, exceed one percent (1%) of the Purchase Price").
- **Acceptable**: 1.5% to 2% of Purchase Price.
- **Resist**: Anything above 2.5% of Purchase Price.
- The cap should be all-inclusive: it covers breaches of reps, breaches of covenants, indemnification obligations, and any other liability arising from the PSA or the transaction, "whether based in contract, tort, strict liability, statute, common law or otherwise" (Detailed Seller PSA, Section 10.4).

### Key Negotiation Points

- The UNICO Seller Side form provides 2.5% of Purchase Price (Section 5.4). The Detailed Seller PSA provides 1% (Section 10.4). The gap between 1% and 2.5% on a $100M deal is $1.5M -- significant but negotiable.
- The cap should apply to all claims "arising under or in connection with" the PSA, not just breach-of-rep claims. Language from the Detailed Seller PSA is the model: "the total liability of Seller for all such breaches and any matters relating thereto or under any law applicable to the Property or this transaction."
- Resist buyer attempts to carve out categories of claims from the cap:
  - **Fraud**: Concede a fraud carve-out only if limited to actual (not constructive) fraud committed by the seller's specifically identified knowledge representatives. Do not allow a general fraud carve-out that applies to any person.
  - **Environmental**: No carve-out. The as-is clause and environmental release handle this.
  - **Tax**: No carve-out. Tax indemnities should be within the cap.
  - **Proration adjustments**: Concede that post-closing proration true-ups are outside the cap, as these are mechanical adjustments rather than liability claims.
  - **Intentional misrepresentation / willful misconduct**: Concede if necessary, but define narrowly (require intent to deceive, not mere negligence or constructive knowledge).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: 5% to 10% of Purchase Price with carve-outs for fraud, environmental, and fundamental reps.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. Hold at 1% for as long as possible. Point to the Detailed Seller PSA and note that this reflects a sophisticated, arms-length transaction with experienced counsel on both sides.
2. If buyer insists on a higher cap, move to 1.5% but eliminate the basket/de minimis threshold (or reduce it) as a trade-off.
3. If buyer demands carve-outs, concede a fraud carve-out (narrowly defined) but hold the line on environmental and tax carve-outs.
4. Never exceed 2.5% of Purchase Price. If the buyer demands more, it suggests the buyer has identified specific risks that should be addressed through a purchase price reduction, insurance, or specific indemnities rather than a general cap increase.
5. If forced to increase the cap, offset by shortening the survival period or strengthening the anti-sandbagging provision.

### Risk Assessment

- The cap defines the seller's maximum downside. On a $100M deal, a 1% cap limits exposure to $1M; a 5% cap exposes the seller to $5M. Given that institutional seller entities are typically SPEs with no assets post-closing other than escrowed funds or distributed proceeds, the cap interacts directly with the escrow/holdback negotiation.
- A cap that is too high may require the seller to maintain a reserve or escrow, delaying distribution of proceeds and reducing the seller's net return.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Industrial**: Buyers will argue for higher caps due to environmental risk. Counter with the as-is clause and environmental insurance availability.
- **Office/Retail/Multifamily**: 1-2% caps should be achievable.
- **Data centers**: Buyers may argue for higher caps given infrastructure complexity. Counter with the thoroughness of due diligence and the availability of infrastructure warranties from contractors.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Liability caps are enforceable in all US jurisdictions between sophisticated commercial parties. No jurisdiction imposes a minimum cap.
- Ensure the cap is drafted as a limitation on damages, not as a liquidated damages provision (which could be challenged as a penalty in some jurisdictions).

---

## Basket/Deductible Thresholds

### Preferred Position

- **True deductible (preferred)**: Seller is liable only for amounts exceeding the threshold. The buyer permanently absorbs losses up to the deductible amount. This is the strongest seller position.
- **Threshold**: 0.50% to 1.00% of Purchase Price. On a $100M deal, this is $500,000 to $1,000,000.
- **Alternative: Tipping basket with high threshold**: If the buyer insists on a tipping basket (first-dollar recovery once the threshold is met), push for a higher threshold (0.75% to 1.00% of Purchase Price) to compensate for the greater exposure.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 10.4) uses a $100,000 tipping basket with a 1% cap. Once claims exceed $100,000 in the aggregate, "the full amount of such valid claims against Seller, and not just the amount above One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) shall be actionable up to, but not in excess of, the Claim Cap." This is a tipping basket.
- The UNICO forms use per-claim minimums ($50,000 seller side, $25,000 buyer side) rather than aggregate baskets. Per-claim minimums and aggregate baskets serve different functions and can be used together.
- Frame the basket as a claims-filtering mechanism: it prevents nuisance claims and administrative burden for both parties. It is not designed to eliminate legitimate claims -- it screens out the "noise."
- Push for a true deductible rather than a tipping basket. The economic difference is significant: on a $100M deal with a 0.50% threshold, a tipping basket means $500,000 of buyer-absorbed loss disappears entirely once claims hit $500,001 (seller pays the full amount). A true deductible means the buyer always absorbs the first $500,000, and the seller pays only the excess.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Low tipping basket (0.15% to 0.25%) or no basket at all.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. Hold on true deductible at 0.50% for as long as possible.
2. If buyer insists on a tipping basket, accept but increase the threshold to 0.50% to 0.75%.
3. If buyer demands a low threshold (0.25%), accept a tipping basket at 0.25% but increase the per-claim de minimis threshold to $50,000-$100,000 to filter individual nuisance claims.
4. If forced to a low basket with a tipping mechanism, offset by reducing the cap, shortening survival, or strengthening anti-sandbagging.

### Risk Assessment

- The basket is the seller's second line of defense after the as-is clause. A high true deductible ensures that only significant, legitimate claims reach the seller. A low tipping basket provides minimal protection.

### Asset-Type Variations

- Generally consistent across asset types. Higher baskets are easier to justify for simpler assets (industrial, net-leased) and harder to justify for complex assets (multi-tenant office, retail).

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Both true deductibles and tipping baskets are enforceable in all US jurisdictions.
- Draft with precision: "Seller shall not be liable for any Claim unless and until the aggregate amount of all Claims exceeds [threshold], in which event Seller shall be liable only for the amount by which such Claims exceed [threshold]" (true deductible) vs. "in which event Seller shall be liable for the full amount of such Claims from the first dollar thereof" (tipping basket).

---

## Per-Claim Minimums (De Minimis Threshold)

### Preferred Position

- Per-claim minimum of $50,000 to $100,000. Claims below this threshold are excluded entirely and do not count toward the aggregate basket.
- The UNICO Seller Side form uses $50,000 (Section 5.4). The Detailed Seller PSA uses $100,000 (Section 10.4). Both are strong seller positions.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Per-claim minimums serve a different function than aggregate baskets: they filter individual small claims, regardless of the aggregate. This prevents the buyer from aggregating dozens of trivial issues (minor lease discrepancies, cosmetic building conditions, small code violations) into a material claim.
- Ensure the de minimis threshold is clearly independent of the aggregate basket: claims below the de minimis do not count toward the aggregate basket.
- Include a provision that related claims arising from the same set of facts constitute a single claim for de minimis purposes (prevents the buyer from characterizing a single issue as multiple small claims to avoid the per-claim minimum).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: $10,000 to $25,000 per-claim minimum.

**Fallback**: Accept $25,000 per-claim minimum but ensure it does not count toward the aggregate basket. If buyer demands $10,000 or less, point out the administrative burden of processing trivial claims on both sides.

### Risk Assessment

- Per-claim minimums are relatively low-stakes compared to the cap and aggregate basket. They serve an important administrative function but do not materially affect the overall risk allocation.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily**: Buyers will argue for lower de minimis thresholds due to the high volume of tenant-level issues. Counter that the sheer volume is precisely why a higher threshold is needed -- otherwise, the seller faces an avalanche of small claims.
- **Office/Industrial/Retail**: $50,000-$100,000 should be achievable.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Universally enforceable. No jurisdiction-specific considerations.

---

## Insurance-First Requirements

### Preferred Position

Require the buyer to exhaust all available insurance remedies before asserting claims against seller. The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 10.4) provides: "Purchaser agrees to first seek recovery under any insurance policies, Leases and Contracts prior to seeking recovery from Seller, and Seller shall not be liable to Purchaser if Purchaser's claim is satisfied from such sources."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Insurance-first requirements are a powerful seller tool. They:
  - Shift the cost of claims to the buyer's insurance carrier rather than the seller.
  - Delay the buyer's ability to assert claims, potentially running out the survival clock.
  - Reduce the likelihood that claims ever reach the seller (many claims are covered by insurance).
- Push for the broadest possible insurance-first requirement: buyer must seek recovery under property insurance, environmental insurance, title insurance, tenant default insurance, leases (tenant indemnities), and contracts (contractor warranties) before making a claim against seller.
- Include a provision that seller is not liable to the extent buyer's claim is "covered by" insurance, even if the buyer elects not to file a claim. This prevents the buyer from strategically bypassing insurance to preserve insurance limits while recovering from the seller.
- Resist any tolling of the survival period during the insurance claims process. The survival period should run regardless of whether the buyer is pursuing insurance.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: No insurance-first requirement, or insurance-first with survival tolling.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. Hold on full insurance-first with no tolling. Point to the Detailed Seller PSA as market precedent.
2. If buyer demands tolling, accept but cap the toll at 90 days (i.e., the survival period extends by no more than 90 days while the buyer pursues insurance). This is a meaningful concession but preserves the seller's interest in finality.
3. If buyer demands elimination of insurance-first, accept but offset by reducing the cap (since the seller bears greater direct exposure) or increasing the basket.
4. As a compromise, accept that buyer need not exhaust insurance but seller receives a credit (dollar-for-dollar reduction in seller's liability) for any amounts recovered from insurance, net of buyer's deductible. Buyer must assign to seller (or grant seller subrogation rights over) any insurance recovery rights related to the claim.

### Risk Assessment

- Insurance-first requirements materially reduce the seller's exposure. On a $100M deal with a 2% cap ($2M), an insurance-first requirement may reduce actual claims reaching the seller to near zero.
- The interaction between insurance-first and survival period is the key strategic dynamic. If the survival period is 6 months and the insurance claims process takes 4-5 months, the buyer has minimal time to assert a claim against the seller.

### Asset-Type Variations

- Most effective for properties with comprehensive insurance programs (office, retail, multifamily). Less effective for industrial properties where environmental claims may not be covered by standard insurance.
- For all asset types, check that the buyer is required to maintain adequate insurance as a closing condition (see Detailed Seller PSA, definition of "Required Purchaser Insurance").

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Insurance-first requirements are enforceable in all US jurisdictions. No jurisdiction prohibits them.
- Subrogation and assignment provisions must comply with the applicable insurance policy's anti-assignment and anti-subrogation clauses.

---

## Interaction with As-Is/Where-Is Clause

### Preferred Position

The as-is clause is the seller's most powerful post-closing defense. Ensure it is comprehensive, broadly drafted, and supported by:

1. **Comprehensive disclaimer**: Disclaim all representations and warranties except those expressly stated in the PSA. The Seller Income Property form (Section 7.4) is the model: disclaim value, income potential, suitability, habitability, merchantability, fitness for purpose, condition, code compliance, environmental condition, zoning, and all other matters.
2. **Express release**: The buyer releases the seller from all claims, known and unknown, arising from the condition of the property. Include a California Civil Code Section 1542 waiver (for California deals) and equivalent waivers for other jurisdictions.
3. **Environmental release**: Specifically release environmental liability. The Meadows form (Section 4.6) releases "all claims and liability, including Environmental Liability."
4. **Acknowledgment of due diligence**: The buyer acknowledges that it has conducted (or had the opportunity to conduct) thorough inspections, investigations, and analyses, and is acquiring the property based on its own investigations. See Meadows form (Section 4.6) and Seller Income Property form (Section 7.4).
5. **Limited carve-out**: The as-is clause should contain a narrow carve-out for seller's express representations and warranties as stated in the PSA, subject to all survival, cap, basket, and anti-sandbagging limitations. This carve-out is market-standard and necessary for enforceability -- it would be unconscionable to disclaim all representations while simultaneously making representations.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The as-is clause should require initialing or separate acknowledgment by both parties. The Seller Income Property form and Meadows form both include seller's and buyer's initials lines adjacent to the as-is clause and the release.
- Ensure the as-is clause appears in every relevant document: the PSA, the deed, the bill of sale, the assignment of leases, and the assignment of contracts. The Detailed Seller PSA accomplishes this through its exhibit forms.
- The phrase "subject to all time, dollar and other limitations on Seller's liability set forth in the Agreement" should appear in every closing document that references the PSA. This ties all documents back to the negotiated survival/cap/basket framework. See Detailed Seller PSA, Exhibit F (Deed), Exhibit G (Bill of Sale), Exhibit H (Assignment and Assumption Agreement).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Accept the as-is clause with a broader carve-out for seller's representations, covenants, and indemnification obligations.

**Fallback**: The narrow carve-out for "express representations and warranties as stated in the PSA, subject to all limitations therein" is the standard compromise. Do not expand it to include "covenants" or "indemnification" in the as-is carve-out language -- those are separately preserved by the anti-merger clause and the specific survival provisions.

### Risk Assessment

- A well-drafted as-is clause is the seller's best defense against post-closing claims. It shifts the risk of property conditions (physical, environmental, regulatory, economic) to the buyer. Combined with short survival periods and low caps, it creates a virtually clean exit for the seller.
- The as-is clause is particularly important for environmental conditions, which can generate massive liability.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Industrial**: As-is clause is critical. Buyers may push for environmental carve-outs. Resist by pointing to the buyer's pre-closing Phase I/II assessment and the availability of environmental insurance.
- **All types**: The as-is clause structure is the same regardless of asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **California**: Section 1542 waiver is required to waive unknown claims. Without it, the release may not cover claims the buyer did not know about at closing.
- **New York**: As-is clauses are strictly enforced. New York courts have held that sophisticated buyers in commercial transactions cannot assert claims for conditions discoverable through due diligence when they have signed an as-is clause.
- **Oregon**: The Meadows form includes Oregon-specific statutory disclaimers (ORS 93.040). Ensure compliance.
- **Washington**: The Seller Income Property form includes Washington-specific environmental disclosure requirements (RCW Ch. 64.06). The buyer waives the right to receive the seller disclosure statement except for the environmental section.

---

## Anti-Sandbagging Provisions

### Preferred Position

**Strong anti-sandbagging**: If the buyer knew or should have known of a breach at or before Closing and nevertheless closed, the buyer waives all claims arising from that breach. Include both actual knowledge and constructive (deemed) knowledge standards.

The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 5.4, optional text) provides the model:
> "Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event the Closing occurs, Buyer hereby expressly waives, relinquishes and releases any right or remedy available to it at law, in equity or under this Agreement to make a claim against Seller for damages that Buyer may incur, or to rescind this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, as the result of any of Seller's representations or warranties being untrue, inaccurate or incorrect if (1) Buyer knew that such representation or warranty was untrue, inaccurate or incorrect at the time of the Closing and Buyer nevertheless closes title hereunder, or (2) Buyer's damages as a result of such representations or warranties being untrue, inaccurate or incorrect are, in the aggregate, less than $50,000."

The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 7.4) goes further:
> "All of Seller's representations and warranties shall automatically be deemed modified to reflect Purchaser's Knowledge as of the end of the Study Period."

This "automatic modification" provision is the strongest possible anti-sandbagging mechanism. It does not merely bar claims for known breaches -- it eliminates the breach itself by deeming the representations modified.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The "constructive knowledge" or "deemed knowledge" standard is the key battleground. There are several tiers:
  - **Actual subjective knowledge**: The buyer's named individuals actually knew of the breach. Weakest anti-sandbagging.
  - **Constructive knowledge based on due diligence materials**: The buyer is "deemed to know" anything contained in the due diligence materials provided by the seller or obtained by the buyer. The UNICO Seller Side form uses this: "Buyer shall be 'deemed to have known' that a representation or warranty was untrue, inaccurate or incorrect at the time of the Closing if any Property Information furnished or made available to or otherwise obtained by Buyer contains express information which is inconsistent with such representation or warranty."
  - **Automatic modification**: The Detailed Seller PSA's approach. Reps are deemed modified to conform to buyer's knowledge. Strongest anti-sandbagging.
- Push for automatic modification or, at minimum, constructive knowledge based on all due diligence materials.
- The anti-sandbagging provision should cover not just the buyer's own investigations but also information provided by the seller in the data room, third-party reports obtained by the buyer, estoppel certificates, title commitments, surveys, environmental reports, and any other information "made available to or otherwise obtained by" the buyer.
- Pair the anti-sandbagging provision with the bring-down certificate: at Closing, seller delivers a certificate updating its representations. Any disclosures in the bring-down certificate are known to the buyer at Closing, triggering the anti-sandbagging waiver.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Pro-sandbagging (buyer may assert claims regardless of knowledge) or anti-sandbagging limited to actual subjective knowledge of named individuals.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. Hold on automatic modification (Detailed Seller PSA model) for as long as possible.
2. If buyer resists automatic modification, fall back to constructive knowledge based on all due diligence materials and information made available to or obtained by buyer.
3. If buyer insists on limiting to actual knowledge, negotiate the list of "knowledge individuals" to include the buyer's deal lead, asset manager, in-house counsel, and any third-party consultant leads (e.g., environmental consultant, property condition consultant). The broader the list, the more protective for the seller.
4. If buyer insists on a narrow knowledge standard, offset by shortening survival, reducing the cap, or increasing the basket.
5. As a minimum acceptable position, include a provision that the buyer may not assert any claim based on a condition that was disclosed in the due diligence materials or that was reasonably discoverable through the inspections, investigations, and analyses that the buyer had the right to conduct during the due diligence period (whether or not the buyer actually conducted them).

### Risk Assessment

- Anti-sandbagging is one of the seller's most important protective provisions. Without it, the buyer can conduct exhaustive due diligence, discover issues, close anyway (presumably at a price that already reflects the issues), and then assert post-closing claims for the same issues -- effectively collecting twice.
- The NY Negotiation Checklist explicitly recommends that buyers preserve sandbagging rights. This means sophisticated buyers will aggressively resist anti-sandbagging provisions.

### Asset-Type Variations

- The anti-sandbagging analysis is the same regardless of asset type. However, the volume and complexity of due diligence materials varies:
  - **Data centers and industrial**: Extensive technical documentation. Constructive knowledge based on these materials is broadly protective for the seller.
  - **Office and retail**: Standard commercial due diligence. Constructive knowledge is effective.
  - **Multifamily**: High volume of unit-level information. Constructive knowledge standard may be particularly effective given the sheer volume of data available to the buyer.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York**: New York is a pro-sandbagging jurisdiction by default (CBS v. Ziff-Davis). Express anti-sandbagging language is essential in New York deals to override the default rule.
- **California**: California leans anti-sandbagging under common law, which favors the seller's position. Express anti-sandbagging language reinforces the default.
- **Delaware**: Pro-sandbagging default. Express language is essential.
- **Illinois**: Anti-sandbagging tendency. Express language reinforces.

---

## Exclusive Remedy Provisions

### Preferred Position

The indemnification mechanism set forth in the PSA should be the sole and exclusive post-closing remedy. The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 10.4) provides the model:

> "following the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and Purchaser under, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Property and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether based in contract, tort, strict liability, statute, common law or otherwise, shall be as set forth in this Section 10.4."

This eliminates common-law tort claims, unjust enrichment, fraudulent concealment, and all other non-contractual theories.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The exclusive remedy clause must be comprehensive. It should cover claims "under, arising out of, or relating to" the agreement, the property, and the transaction -- not just claims "under" the agreement.
- Include the phrase "whether based in contract, tort, strict liability, statute, common law or otherwise" to sweep in all possible legal theories.
- The exclusive remedy clause works in tandem with the cap, basket, and survival limitations: it channels all claims through the negotiated framework.
- Concede a narrow fraud carve-out if necessary (actual fraud by named knowledge individuals), but ensure the carve-out does not swallow the rule.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Exclusive remedy with broad carve-outs for fraud, equitable remedies, environmental claims, and tax claims.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. Accept a fraud carve-out limited to actual fraud committed by the seller's specifically identified knowledge representatives, with scienter (intent to deceive) as a required element.
2. Accept an equitable remedies carve-out only for specific performance of closing obligations (not post-closing claims).
3. Resist environmental carve-outs. The as-is clause and environmental release handle this.
4. Resist tax carve-outs. Tax matters are covered by the general indemnification framework.

### Risk Assessment

- Without an exclusive remedy clause, the buyer can pursue common-law tort claims that may have different (and potentially longer) limitation periods, different damage measures (including punitive damages), and different procedural advantages. The exclusive remedy clause eliminates this risk.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No material variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Exclusive remedy clauses are enforceable in all US jurisdictions between sophisticated commercial parties. Most courts have held that even fraud claims can be channeled through an exclusive remedy mechanism, although this is more controversial. A narrow fraud carve-out is advisable to avoid challenge.
- CERCLA claims may not be waivable. The exclusive remedy clause should not purport to waive statutory environmental claims against the government (which it cannot do), but it can channel inter-party indemnification claims.

## Indemnification Procedures

### Preferred Position

- **Notice as condition precedent**: Written notice of a claim must be delivered within the survival period as a condition precedent to recovery. Late notice extinguishes the claim entirely. The UNICO Seller Side form's termination language supports this: claims "not then in litigation" terminate at the end of the survival period.
- **Litigation requirement**: To preserve a claim, the buyer must commence a formal legal proceeding (not just deliver a notice) within the survival period. This is the strongest seller position.
- **Specificity requirement**: Claim notices must describe the breach in reasonable detail, identify the specific representation or warranty breached, and provide a good-faith estimate of damages. Vague or generic notices are insufficient.
- **Cure right**: Seller has 30-60 days from receipt of notice to cure the breach before the buyer may pursue remedies.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The "litigation within the survival period" requirement (per the UNICO Seller Side form) is highly protective. It requires the buyer to not only identify a claim but retain counsel and file suit, all within 6 months. This is a high bar.
- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 10.4) requires that "no action or proceeding thereon shall be valid or enforceable, at law or in equity, if a legal proceeding is not commenced within that time."
- Resist buyer attempts to make notice a covenant (rather than condition precedent) with a prejudice exception. The condition-precedent structure provides clear, bright-line finality.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Notice (not litigation) within survival period preserves the claim; notice is a covenant with a prejudice exception.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. Hold on litigation-within-survival as long as possible.
2. If buyer insists on notice-only, accept but require the notice to be detailed and specific (identify the specific rep, describe the breach, quantify damages in good faith). A generic "we reserve all rights" notice should not suffice.
3. If buyer insists on a prejudice exception, accept but define "material prejudice" narrowly: seller must demonstrate that the late notice actually impaired its ability to investigate, cure, or mitigate the claimed breach.
4. Always maintain the cure right (30-60 days).

### Risk Assessment

- The procedure provisions are the gatekeeping mechanism. A "notice within survival" requirement with a prejudice exception is significantly less protective than "litigation within survival." The litigation requirement imposes real costs and commitment on the buyer, filtering out all but the most serious claims.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No material variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- New York courts strictly enforce notice-as-condition-precedent provisions, making New York a favorable jurisdiction for sellers on this point.
- California courts may be more lenient, applying equitable principles to excuse late notice.

## Third-Party Claim Procedures

### Preferred Position

- Seller controls the defense of any third-party claim for which seller may be liable under the indemnification provisions.
- Seller selects counsel, directs litigation strategy, and has sole authority to settle claims.
- Buyer must cooperate fully with seller's defense.
- Buyer may participate at its own expense but may not interfere with seller's defense.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Defense control is critical for third-party claims because the indemnifying party (seller) bears the economic risk and should therefore control the defense.
- Seller's settlement authority should be unrestricted, except that seller may not settle a claim that (a) imposes non-monetary obligations on buyer, (b) does not include a full release of buyer, or (c) admits liability on behalf of buyer, without buyer's consent.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Buyer controls defense; seller reimburses.

**Fallback**: Accept buyer control of defense but with the following protections: (a) buyer must use competent counsel reasonably acceptable to seller, (b) buyer must consult with seller on material litigation decisions, (c) buyer may not settle without seller's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), and (d) seller's liability for defense costs counts toward the cap.

### Risk Assessment

- Defense control is a significant economic right. The party controlling the defense makes strategic decisions about settlement versus litigation, choice of defense strategy, and expenditure of resources.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No material variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Standard across all jurisdictions. Defense-control provisions are universally enforceable.

---

## Merger Doctrine and Closing Documents

### Preferred Position

While the anti-merger clause preserves certain obligations (including seller's surviving rights), ensure that closing documents reinforce the negotiated survival limitations:

- The deed should contain no warranties beyond those required by the form of deed (e.g., special warranty deed in many jurisdictions). The UNICO forms use a statutory/special warranty deed, which limits seller's title warranty to claims arising through the seller.
- The deed should include a provision that the grantee (buyer) may rely on PSA reps "subject to all time, dollar and other limitations on Grantor's liability set forth in the Agreement" (Detailed Seller PSA, Exhibit F).
- The bill of sale should disclaim all warranties ("AS IS" -- see Meadows, Exhibit C: "SELLER DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE WHATEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE PERSONAL PROPERTY. THE PERSONAL PROPERTY IS SOLD ON AN 'AS IS' BASIS").
- Assignments of leases and contracts should be "without representation or warranty except as expressly set forth in the Purchase Agreement" (UNICO forms, Exhibits F and G), with the further qualifier "all of which are subject to all time, dollar and other limitations on Seller's liability set forth in the Agreement" (Detailed Seller PSA, Assignment).

### Key Negotiation Points

- Every closing document is an opportunity for the buyer to expand seller's liability beyond the PSA framework. Review every closing document for consistency with the negotiated survival/cap/basket framework.
- Reject any closing document language that creates new, uncapped representations or warranties.
- Ensure the seller estoppel certificate (if delivered in lieu of tenant estoppels) is "subject to all time, dollar and other limitations on Seller's liability set forth in the Agreement" (Detailed Seller PSA, Exhibit B-1).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Standard -- closing document language typically follows the PSA. The key is vigilance in reviewing drafts.

### Risk Assessment

- A closing document that inadvertently creates an uncapped, indefinite-survival representation can undermine the entire survival/cap framework. This is a drafting risk that requires careful attention.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No variation by asset type. The closing document structure is universal.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- In New York, the deed form (bargain and sale deed with covenants against grantor's acts) carries implied warranties. Ensure the PSA expressly limits the scope of deed warranties.
- In western states, special warranty deeds are standard and limit seller's exposure to claims arising through the seller.

---

## Escrow/Holdback Resistance Strategy

### Preferred Position

No post-closing escrow, holdback, letter of credit, or guaranty. The buyer's sole recourse is a claim against the seller entity, subject to the cap, basket, survival, and anti-sandbagging limitations.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Escrows and holdbacks tie up seller's sale proceeds, reduce the seller's IRR, and create administrative burden.
- The seller's strongest argument against escrows: the negotiated cap, basket, survival, and anti-sandbagging framework already adequately protects the buyer. An escrow on top of these protections provides duplicative security.
- If the buyer argues that the seller SPE may dissolve after closing, respond that (a) the anti-sandbagging provision and as-is clause minimize the likelihood of legitimate claims, (b) the cap limits maximum exposure, and (c) the survival period is short.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Escrow of 3-5% of Purchase Price for 12-18 months.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. Refuse all escrows/holdbacks. Point out that institutional buyers accept entity credit risk in virtually all other contexts.
2. If buyer insists on security, offer a limited guaranty from a creditworthy affiliate (not the fund itself) for the duration of the survival period, capped at the liability cap amount.
3. If buyer insists on an escrow, agree to an escrow of 1% of Purchase Price (equal to the cap) for a period not exceeding the survival period (6-9 months). The escrow should be released in full at the end of the survival period, except for amounts subject to pending claims for which a conforming notice has been delivered and a legal proceeding commenced.
4. If buyer demands a larger escrow, treat it as a purchase price negotiation: a 3% escrow for 18 months has a meaningful time-value-of-money cost that should be reflected in the headline purchase price.
5. Never agree to an escrow that exceeds the cap or that extends beyond the survival period.

### Risk Assessment

- Escrows reduce the seller's certainty of proceeds and create administrative burden. However, they also provide a mechanism for resolving claims without litigation (the escrow agent can release funds upon joint instruction or court order).
- The cost of escrow is primarily time-value-of-money and administrative. On a $100M deal with a 2% escrow held for 12 months, the time-value cost at a 5% discount rate is approximately $100,000.

### Asset-Type Variations

- Buyers are most likely to demand escrows for industrial (environmental risk), older office (deferred maintenance risk), and value-add multifamily (condition risk). The seller's resistance should be calibrated accordingly.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Escrow provisions are universally enforceable. No jurisdiction-specific limitations.

---

## Seller Entity Dissolution Protection

### Preferred Position

Preserve the seller's right to dissolve the SPE and distribute proceeds promptly after Closing. Resist anti-dissolution covenants, asset maintenance covenants, and guarantor requirements.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.16) expressly limits recourse to seller's interest in the property (pre-closing) or net sale proceeds (post-closing). This is the seller's preferred framework.
- If the buyer insists on anti-dissolution covenants, negotiate the shortest possible period (coextensive with the survival period -- e.g., 6 months).
- If forced to accept an anti-dissolution covenant, include exceptions for (a) dissolution required by the seller's organizational documents, (b) dissolution directed by a court of competent jurisdiction, and (c) dissolution following distribution of all assets, provided seller maintains a reasonable reserve for known claims.
- Resist guaranty requirements. If a guaranty is required, limit it to (a) the cap amount, (b) the survival period, and (c) breaches of express representations and warranties only (not all PSA obligations).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: 18-24 month anti-dissolution covenant plus parent/manager guaranty.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. Refuse guaranty. Accept anti-dissolution covenant for the survival period (6-9 months) only.
2. If buyer demands a guaranty, offer a limited guaranty from the asset manager (not the fund) capped at the liability cap amount and expiring at the end of the survival period.
3. If buyer demands a longer anti-dissolution covenant, accept 12 months maximum but only if the survival period is also extended to 12 months (making the covenant coextensive and no more burdensome than the survival period itself).
4. Never accept an anti-dissolution covenant longer than 18 months or a guaranty that exceeds the cap or extends beyond the survival period.

### Risk Assessment

- Anti-dissolution covenants delay the seller's ability to wind up the SPE and distribute proceeds. This creates administrative burden and potential tax inefficiency.
- Guaranty obligations create contingent liability on the guarantor's balance sheet, which may affect the guarantor's borrowing capacity or other financial metrics.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No variation by asset type. Driven by entity structure.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Delaware LLC dissolution is rapid and straightforward. Anti-dissolution covenants are enforceable contractual obligations that override the statutory dissolution process.
- The DLLCA provides for continuation of a dissolved LLC for winding-up purposes, including satisfaction of claims. However, this continuation is limited in scope and may not provide the buyer with adequate protection, which is why buyers seek express anti-dissolution covenants.

---

## Recourse Limitations

### Preferred Position

Limit buyer's recourse to:
1. The seller entity only (no personal liability for any individual).
2. Seller's interest in the property (pre-closing) or net sale proceeds (post-closing).
3. No recourse against seller's negative capital account or contribution obligations of members.
4. No consequential, incidental, indirect, punitive, special, or exemplary damages.

The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 10.4 and Section 11.16) provides the comprehensive model:
> "Purchaser's recourse against Seller... shall be limited to Seller's interest in the Property (or, following the Closing, to the net proceeds of the sale of the Property actually received by Seller)... in no event shall any of the Seller Parties have any personal liability... no negative capital account or any contribution or payment obligation of any partner or member of Seller shall constitute an asset of Seller."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The non-recourse provision combined with the SPE structure and the right to distribute proceeds means the seller's practical exposure is limited to whatever escrowed funds or retained proceeds exist.
- Ensure the non-recourse provision protects not just the seller entity but also "Seller Parties" -- defined to include all direct and indirect owners, managers, officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates of seller.
- The exclusion of consequential/punitive damages is critical. A breach-of-rep claim that results only in direct damages is manageable; a claim that includes lost profits, diminished property value, or punitive damages can be catastrophic.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Accept non-recourse for individuals but preserve recourse against the seller entity (including its assets, wherever located) and require a guaranty.

**Fallback**: The recourse-to-net-proceeds limitation is strong seller language. If the buyer resists, fall back to recourse against seller entity assets generally (without the net-proceeds limitation) but maintain all other limitations (cap, survival, basket, non-recourse for individuals, no consequential damages).

### Risk Assessment

- The recourse limitation is the seller's final line of defense. If all other protections fail (the as-is clause, anti-sandbagging, insurance-first, basket, and cap), the recourse limitation ensures that the seller's maximum exposure is bounded.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Non-recourse provisions and consequential damage waivers are universally enforceable between sophisticated commercial parties.
- Some jurisdictions (notably New York) have held that contractual waivers of punitive damages are enforceable. Include the waiver in all deals.
