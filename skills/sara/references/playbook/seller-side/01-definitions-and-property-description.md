# Definitions and Property Description — Seller Playbook

This playbook addresses the Definitions and Property Description provisions of a commercial real estate purchase and sale agreement from the **seller** perspective. It is designed for use by AI agents conducting contract review on behalf of institutional sellers disposing of income-producing commercial real estate.

## Property Definition Breadth

### Preferred Position

The Seller's goal is a Property definition that is precise and bounded — conveying exactly what is intended and nothing more. Seller should resist catch-all language and open-ended definitions that could sweep in assets Seller intends to retain, assets belonging to third parties, or rights that cannot legally be transferred. The Property definition should explicitly exclude items Seller intends to retain and items that belong to Seller's property manager, Seller's corporate parent, or third parties.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Property" shall mean, collectively, the Real Property, the Personal Property, Seller's interest in the Leases, and the Intangible Property. The term "Property" does not include the Excluded Items.

The key structural feature is the inclusion of an "Excluded Items" definition and the qualification "Seller's interest" (rather than "all right, title and interest").

### Key Negotiation Points

- Use "Seller's interest" rather than "all right, title and interest" to limit the conveyance to what Seller actually owns. This protects Seller from after-acquired title claims and from conveying interests it does not hold.
- Define an "Excluded Items" category that captures everything Seller intends to retain: marketing materials, internal analyses, appraisals, strategic plans, attorney-client privileged communications, property management software and systems, and organizational documents. Populate this definition at signing — do not leave it as a blank schedule.
- Ensure the Property definition does not capture assets of Seller's affiliates, advisors, or property manager. An overly broad definition could inadvertently convey portfolio-level software licenses, branded materials, or shared service agreements.
- Do not allow the Property definition to create an obligation to convey items that Seller cannot legally transfer (governmental permits, non-assignable licenses, software restricted by license agreements).
- Include a "subject to depletions, replacements and additions in the ordinary course of business" qualifier for Personal Property to account for normal operational changes between signing and Closing.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The Property definition should be as broad as possible, capturing "all right, title and interest" in every asset associated with the real estate. Buyer will resist Excluded Items carve-outs and push for catch-all language.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept "all right, title and interest" language if coupled with clear Excluded Items provisions and a "to the extent owned by Seller and legally transferable" qualifier for intangible assets.
2. Accept an expansive Property definition if the Excluded Items definition is equally expansive and specifically enumerated.
3. Accept the elimination of the "Seller's interest" qualifier for Real Property and Improvements (where Seller owns the fee), but retain it for Personal Property, Intangible Property, and Leases.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — An overbroad Property definition can require Seller to convey assets it did not intend to sell, create title and conveyance issues at Closing, or subject Seller to post-closing claims for failure to deliver assets that were inadvertently swept into the definition.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Seller frequently retains the property management platform, building website, and branded materials when transitioning to a new manager. Ensure these are excluded.
- **Industrial:** Seller-owned equipment used across multiple properties (mobile maintenance equipment, shared fleet vehicles) should be explicitly excluded.
- **Retail:** Common area holiday decorations, seasonal displays, and marketing materials that rotate between Seller's properties should be excluded.
- **Data Center:** Carefully distinguish Seller-owned infrastructure from tenant-owned equipment. Interconnection agreements that generate revenue for Seller's affiliate (not the Property SPE) should be excluded if not intended to transfer.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All states:** The Property definition must be consistent with what can legally be conveyed by deed, bill of sale, and assignment instruments under the applicable state's law.
- **Louisiana:** The civil law distinction between immovables and movables must be addressed in the Property definition and closing instruments.

## Real Property (Land and Improvements)

### Preferred Position

Seller should define "Real Property" precisely, typically as the aggregate of "Land" and "Improvements," with the Land description referencing the legal description exhibit. Seller should resist expansive appurtenance language that could sweep in rights Seller does not own or cannot warrant.

**Preferred sample language for Land:**

> "Land" shall mean the land described on Exhibit A attached hereto, together with all privileges, rights, easements, and appurtenances belonging to such land and all right, title, and interest (if any) of Seller in and to any streets, alleys, passages, or other rights-of-way or appurtenances included in, adjacent to, or used in connection with such land and all right, title, and interest (if any) of Seller in all mineral rights appurtenant to such land.

**Preferred sample language for Improvements:**

> "Improvements" shall mean all buildings, structures, and other improvements situated upon the Land and any fixtures, systems, and facilities owned by Seller and located on the Land.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Use the "right, title and interest (if any)" qualification for appurtenances, mineral rights, and street/alley rights. This avoids warranting that Seller holds such rights, while still conveying whatever Seller does hold.
- The Improvements definition should include the "owned by Seller" qualifier to exclude tenant-owned fixtures and third-party equipment.
- Ensure the legal description on Exhibit A is accurate and matches the survey. Any discrepancy can create title and closing issues.
- Convey by special warranty deed (warranting only against claims arising "by, through, or under Seller"). Resist buyer demands for a general warranty deed in institutional transactions — special warranty deeds with title insurance are the market standard.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The "(if any)" qualification is an inappropriate hedge and suggests Seller may not own the appurtenances. Buyer will push for unqualified conveyance of all appurtenances, mineral rights, development rights, and air rights.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Remove the "(if any)" qualifier but add a representation that Seller has not severed or transferred any mineral rights, development rights, or air rights. This gives Buyer a claim if the rights were severed, without exposing Seller to a warranty on rights it never held.
2. Accept a broader Improvements definition if it includes a carve-out for "those fixtures owned by Tenants or other occupants of the Property or leased by Seller from third parties."
3. Accept an unqualified appurtenance definition for recorded easements and rights-of-way, but retain the qualifier for mineral rights and subsurface rights (where the chain of title is often uncertain).

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — The primary risk is warranting title to rights Seller does not own (especially mineral rights and development rights). A special warranty deed limits Seller's exposure, but the PSA representations compound it.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Western states:** Water rights may require separate conveyance instruments. Seller should ensure the PSA does not purport to convey water rights through the deed alone, as this may be ineffective.
- **Texas:** Mineral estates are frequently severed. Seller should confirm the status of mineral rights before agreeing to convey them.
- **New York:** Air rights / development rights (TDRs) are separately valuable. Seller should confirm whether these are included in or excluded from the transaction.

---

## Appurtenances

### Preferred Position

Seller should keep the Appurtenances definition limited to rights that actually appertain to the Real Property by operation of law — easements, rights-of-way, and recorded appurtenant rights. Seller should resist enumerated lists that expand beyond what naturally runs with the land.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Appurtenances" means all rights, easements, and rights-of-way appurtenant to the beneficial use and enjoyment of the Real Property.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Resist buyer demands to enumerate specific categories (mineral rights, air rights, development rights, water rights) in the Appurtenances definition. These items should be addressed in the Land/Real Property definition with appropriate qualifiers, or excluded entirely and addressed in separate instruments.
- If Buyer insists on enumerating categories, ensure each is qualified with "to the extent owned by Seller" or "to the extent appurtenant."
- Do not include in Appurtenances any rights that require separate assignment or transfer (e.g., water rights in western states, transferable development rights in NYC).

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The Appurtenances definition must be expansive to ensure all property rights transfer. Buyer will enumerate specific categories.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept an enumerated Appurtenances definition with the global qualifier "to the extent owned by Seller and appurtenant to the Real Property."
2. Accept inclusion of mineral rights and development rights in the Appurtenances definition if Seller makes a limited representation that it has not severed such rights (rather than warranting that it owns them).

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — The risk is limited if Seller conveys by special warranty deed, as Seller only warrants against claims arising through Seller. The greater risk is in the PSA representations if Seller is required to warrant ownership of specific appurtenant rights.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Same as Real Property section above. Key concern is western water rights and mineral rights in oil/gas states.

---

## Personal Property Inclusions and Exclusions

### Preferred Position

Seller should define Personal Property narrowly and maintain an Excluded Items schedule that captures everything Seller intends to retain. The Personal Property definition should include qualifiers limiting conveyance to items "owned by Seller" and "used in connection with the operation of the Improvements."

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Personal Property" shall mean all furniture, equipment, machinery, inventories, supplies, signs, and other tangible personal property, if any, owned by Seller and installed, located, or situated on or used in connection with the operation of the Improvements, subject to depletions, replacements, and additions in the ordinary course of business, but excluding all Excluded Items.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **"Owned by Seller" qualifier:** This is essential. Without it, the definition could sweep in tenant-owned personal property, leased equipment (copiers, laundry machines, vending equipment), and property manager-owned items.
- **"Subject to depletions, replacements and additions in the ordinary course":** This qualifier gives Seller flexibility to operate normally between signing and Closing without needing Buyer consent for routine equipment replacements.
- **Excluded Items schedule:** Populate this at signing. Common exclusions include:
  - Materials relating to the marketing and sale of the Property
  - Internal memoranda, projections, and strategic analyses
  - Attorney and accountant work product and privileged materials
  - Appraisals, budgets, and internal authorization submissions
  - Organizational documents and partnership/member agreements
  - Personal property in the management office owned by the property manager
  - Software, computer systems, and technology platforms used by Seller or its manager
  - Proprietary property management and leasing materials
- **Bill of Sale form:** Ensure the Bill of Sale form attached to the PSA includes a "no warranty of condition" provision — Seller conveys personal property "as is, where is" without warranty as to condition, fitness, or merchantability.
- **No Purchase Price allocation obligation:** Resist buyer demands to allocate a specific dollar amount of the Purchase Price to Personal Property. If the buyer insists, ensure Seller has input into the allocation amount.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The burden of exclusion should be on Seller (which is correct from Seller's perspective — Seller should schedule exclusions). However, Buyer will also push for a representation that the Excluded Items schedule is complete and that everything not excluded transfers.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept a representation that the Excluded Items schedule is "materially complete" as of the Effective Date. Avoid "complete" without the qualifier.
2. Accept a Purchase Price allocation to Personal Property if the amount is de minimis (typically 1-3% of Purchase Price for office properties, potentially more for multifamily).
3. Accept removal of the "subject to depletions and replacements" language if the PSA's operating covenant already permits Seller to operate the Property in the ordinary course.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Personal property disputes are typically low-value. The primary risk is inadvertently conveying property manager or tenant assets, or accepting an unfavorable tax allocation.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily:** The Personal Property component is larger (appliances, fitness equipment, pool furniture, maintenance equipment). Seller should ensure the Personal Property schedule is complete and that leased equipment (particularly laundry equipment) is excluded.
- **Data Center:** The line between real property (building systems) and personal property (IT infrastructure) is critical for property tax purposes. Seller should ensure the PSA's characterization is consistent with its property tax positions.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Sales/use tax (varies by state):** The Personal Property allocation may trigger sales or use tax. Consult with tax counsel. Some states (e.g., Washington) impose sales tax on the transfer of personal property in connection with a real estate sale.

---

## Intangible Property

### Preferred Position

Seller should define Intangible Property narrowly and limit the transfer to items that Seller owns, that are specific to the Property (not portfolio-level assets), and that are legally transferable. Seller should include comprehensive qualifiers and carve-outs.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Intangible Property" shall mean all of Seller's right, title, and interest, if any, in all intangible assets relating to the Land, Improvements, or Personal Property, including all of Seller's right, title, and interest, if any, in all (a) warranties and guaranties relating to the Land, Improvements, or Personal Property, (b) all licenses, permits, and approvals relating to the Land, Improvements, or Personal Property, (c) all logos and tradenames relating to the Land, Improvements, or Personal Property, (d) all contract rights, and (e) all plans and specifications relating to the Land, Improvements, or Personal Property, in each case to the extent that Seller may legally transfer the same.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **"Right, title, and interest, if any" qualifier:** This critical qualifier ensures Seller is not warranting the existence or transferability of any intangible asset. Seller conveys whatever it has, but does not warrant that it has anything.
- **"To the extent Seller may legally transfer the same":** This qualifier is essential for permits, licenses, and government-issued approvals, many of which cannot be legally assigned.
- **No affirmative transfer obligation:** The Intangible Property definition should create a conveyance, not an obligation to procure. Seller should not be obligated to obtain new permits, renew expiring licenses, or cure deficiencies in intangible assets.
- **Exclude portfolio-level assets:** Ensure the definition is limited to intangibles "relating to" the specific Property, not Seller's broader business. Portfolio-level software licenses, management platforms, and branded materials should be excluded through the Excluded Items definition.
- **Plans and specifications:** These are typically proprietary to the architect or engineer who prepared them. Seller should qualify this conveyance with "to the extent owned by Seller" and should not represent that it owns the intellectual property in such plans.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Intangible Property should include websites, social media accounts, domain names, telephone numbers, email addresses, and software systems associated with the Property. Buyer will push for a broader definition without qualifiers.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept inclusion of websites, domain names, and telephone numbers specifically associated with the Property (not Seller's corporate accounts), but retain the "to the extent owned by Seller and legally transferable" qualifier.
2. Accept removal of the "if any" qualifier for items that clearly exist (e.g., plans and specifications, if Seller knows it has them), but retain it for items whose existence is uncertain (e.g., unexpired contractor warranties).
3. Accept an obligation to "cooperate" in the transfer of non-assignable permits and licenses, but resist an obligation to "use commercially reasonable efforts" to obtain transfer or re-issuance.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — The primary risk for Seller is inadvertently conveying assets it intended to retain (portfolio-level assets) or warranting the existence or transferability of assets it does not own or cannot transfer.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Data Center:** Interconnection agreements and fiber IRU agreements may be valuable intangible assets held by Seller's affiliate. Ensure these are properly excluded or included depending on the deal structure.
- **Retail:** Naming rights agreements and marketing fund balances should be addressed.
- **Office:** LEED and Energy Star certifications transfer with the building but should be addressed in the transition process.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All states:** Governmental permits are generally non-assignable. Seller should ensure the PSA does not create an absolute obligation to assign non-assignable permits. At most, Seller should agree to cooperate in the re-issuance process.

---

## Leases Definition and Scope

### Preferred Position

Seller should define "Leases" to capture all lease and occupancy agreements affecting the Property, as this is the income stream being sold. However, Seller should be precise about what the definition includes and should not allow it to sweep in Seller-level agreements (management agreements, brokerage agreements) or agreements that are not occupancy agreements.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Leases" shall mean any lease or occupancy agreement, as the same may have been amended, restated, supplemented, altered, or otherwise modified from time to time, pursuant to which Seller has granted another Person the right to use or occupy all or any portion of the Real Property, and all guaranties of any of the obligations of the tenants thereunder delivered in connection with such lease or other agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the term "Leases" does not include subleases.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Include guaranties:** Seller should include guaranties within the Leases definition to ensure a clean transfer at Closing. This avoids arguments about whether guaranties were separately assigned.
- **Exclude subleases:** Subleases are between the tenant and subtenant. Seller has no privity with subtenants and should not be required to represent, warrant, or assign sublease agreements.
- **Lease schedule:** Attach a schedule of all Leases at signing. This schedule should be a closing condition (i.e., the Lease schedule delivered at Closing must be consistent with the schedule at signing, except for leases entered into with Buyer's consent).
- **"Occupancy agreement" breadth:** The definition should capture license agreements, concession agreements, and similar arrangements, but only those creating a right to "use or occupy" the Property. This avoids sweeping in service contracts or vendor agreements.
- **Modification/amendment capture:** The definition should capture all amendments, modifications, and supplements — but only those "in connection with" the occupancy agreement. This prevents an argument that any communication between landlord and tenant constitutes a "modification" to the Lease.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The Leases definition should include subleases, letter of credit deposits, all side agreements, and any agreement that affects the tenancy. Buyer will also push for a representation that the Lease schedule is "complete" and that there are no oral agreements or understandings.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept inclusion of letter of credit deposits as part of the Leases definition, since these function as security deposits and must transfer.
2. Accept a representation that the Lease schedule is "complete in all material respects" — but qualify with "to Seller's Knowledge."
3. Accept that the Leases definition captures "work letter agreements" and "improvement agreements" entered into in connection with the Leases (these are standard landlord obligations).
4. Resist inclusion of subleases in the definition but agree to deliver copies of all subleases of which Seller has actual knowledge.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — The Leases are the income stream that drives the Property's value. Any ambiguity in the definition can lead to disputes about what was conveyed, whether guaranties transferred, or whether Seller has ongoing obligations under lease-related agreements.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Address any co-working operator agreements, which may be structured as leases, licenses, or management agreements. Clarify classification.
- **Industrial:** Ground leases for billboards, cell towers, and solar installations should be specifically identified as Leases.
- **Retail:** Temporary occupancy agreements (pop-up tenants, seasonal kiosks) may or may not be "Leases." Clarify treatment.
- **Multifamily:** Month-to-month tenancies and corporate housing agreements should be captured. Address any rent-regulated tenancies in the schedule and representations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Rent-stabilized and rent-controlled tenancies have specific regulatory requirements. Seller should ensure the Lease schedule identifies the regulatory status of each unit and should make appropriate knowledge-qualified representations.
- **California:** Ensure compliance with AB 1482 and any local rent control ordinances. Seller should represent compliance to Seller's knowledge.

---

## Assumed Contracts Definition and Mechanism

### Preferred Position

Seller's preferred mechanism is a "positive election" process: all Contracts are disclosed, and Buyer designates which Contracts it wishes to assume. Seller is responsible for terminating only those Contracts that Buyer designates for termination, and only if they are terminable without penalty. Seller should not bear the cost of early termination penalties imposed by contract counterparties.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Assumed Contracts" means those Contracts designated by Purchaser in writing during the Study Period as contracts Purchaser elects to assume. If Purchaser does not designate any Contract for assumption or rejection prior to the end of the Study Period, all Contracts that are terminable on thirty (30) days' or less notice without cost or penalty shall be deemed to be non-assumed contracts, and all other Contracts shall be deemed Assumed Contracts.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Positive election (Buyer elects to assume):** This is Seller's preferred approach, as it places the burden on Buyer to identify which contracts it wants. If Buyer fails to act, the default should favor Seller (e.g., all non-terminable contracts are deemed assumed).
- **Termination cost allocation:** Seller should not bear early termination penalties. If Buyer wants a contract terminated that is not terminable on 30 days' notice without penalty, Buyer should bear the cost.
- **Seller's termination obligation:** Limit Seller's obligation to terminate non-assumed contracts to those that are terminable on 30 days' or less notice without cost or penalty. For all others, Buyer should assume them or bear the termination cost.
- **Management agreement:** Seller should agree to terminate its property management agreement at Closing, as this is market standard. However, Seller should negotiate for the management agreement termination to be at Seller's expense only if it is terminable without penalty; otherwise, the termination cost should be shared or borne by Buyer.
- **Material Contracts distinction:** Some forms distinguish "Material Contracts" (those exceeding a dollar threshold or not terminable on short notice) from ordinary service contracts. This is useful for Seller to limit which contracts require Buyer's consent for modification or termination during the pre-Closing period.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Seller should terminate all non-assumed contracts at Seller's expense, regardless of penalties, and should not be permitted to enter into new contracts without Buyer's consent.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept Buyer's negative election mechanism (Buyer designates which contracts it does NOT wish to assume, with the remainder transferring), but retain the limitation that Seller's termination obligation applies only to contracts terminable on 30 days' notice without penalty.
2. Accept that Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to terminate non-assumed contracts, and if early termination penalties are incurred, the parties will split them 50/50, with a cap on Seller's share.
3. Accept a consent requirement for new contracts entered into after signing, but with a deemed consent mechanism (consent deemed given if Buyer does not respond within 5 Business Days).
4. Accept that the management agreement will be terminated at Seller's expense, as this is market standard and expected.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — The primary risk for Seller is being obligated to pay early termination penalties for contracts that were disclosed during diligence and that Buyer had the opportunity to evaluate. This risk can be managed by limiting the termination obligation to terminable-on-30-days contracts.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- No material jurisdictional variation for the contract assumption mechanism itself.

---

## Business Day Definition

### Preferred Position

Seller should push for a Business Day definition that includes holidays in both the Property's jurisdiction and Seller's home jurisdiction, and that provides for extensions in the event of extraordinary events. A broader Business Day definition (more days excluded as non-Business Days) effectively extends Seller's time periods for performance.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Business Day" shall mean any day of the week other than (i) Saturday and Sunday, (ii) a day on which banking institutions in [Seller's City, State] or the city in which the Real Property is located are obligated or authorized by law or executive action to be closed to the transaction of normal (and non-automated) banking business, and (iii) a day on which governmental functions in [Seller's City, State] or the city in which the Real Property is located are interrupted because of extraordinary events such as hurricanes, blizzards, power outages, or acts of terrorism.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Dual-jurisdiction standard:** Including Seller's home jurisdiction (in addition to the Property's jurisdiction) ensures that Seller has adequate time to perform even if Seller's offices are closed for a local holiday or extraordinary event.
- **Extraordinary events clause:** This provides a built-in force majeure mechanism for deadline calculations, protecting Seller against missed deadlines during events beyond Seller's control.
- **Favor of Seller for cure periods:** The broader the Business Day definition, the more time Seller has under cure periods calculated in Business Days.
- **Calendar day vs. Business Day:** Seller should push for critical buyer deadlines (diligence termination, deposit posting) to be calculated in calendar days, while Seller's performance deadlines (delivery of due diligence materials, cure of title defects) should be calculated in Business Days.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The Business Day definition should reference only the Property's jurisdiction, and should not include an extraordinary events exclusion.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept a single-jurisdiction definition (Property jurisdiction only) if the PSA includes a separate force majeure provision that extends deadlines for extraordinary events.
2. Accept removal of the "extraordinary events" clause, but retain the dual-jurisdiction standard.
3. If forced to accept a narrow Business Day definition, negotiate longer numerical deadlines for Seller's performance obligations.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — The Business Day definition is a technical provision that rarely drives deal outcomes, but it can create procedural leverage in tight-deadline situations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Same as Buyer Playbook. Key consideration is multi-state portfolio transactions.

---

## Knowledge Definition

### Preferred Position

Seller's goal is the narrowest possible Knowledge definition: actual knowledge of a single designated individual, without any duty of inquiry, investigation, or imputed knowledge. The named individual should be someone with operational familiarity with the Property but who is insulated from personal liability.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Seller's Knowledge" or "to the knowledge of Seller" means the actual knowledge of [NAME] (the "Designated Seller Representative"), without such person undertaking any investigation or inquiry. The Designated Seller Representative is named solely for the purpose of defining the scope of Seller's knowledge and not for the purpose of imposing any liability on or creating any duties running from such individual to Purchaser. Purchaser covenants that it will bring no action of any kind against the Designated Seller Representative related to or arising out of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Single named individual:** Limit to one person — the asset manager or portfolio manager who has operational familiarity with the Property. Resist naming multiple individuals, the property manager, or in-house counsel.
- **No duty of inquiry:** The core Seller protection. "Actual knowledge" means what the person actually knows at the time of the representation — no obligation to investigate, review files, or make inquiries.
- **No imputed knowledge:** Resist any language imputing knowledge from files, records, due diligence materials, or the property manager. Each of these imputation mechanisms significantly broadens the knowledge standard.
- **Personal liability protection:** Include an express covenant from Buyer not to sue the named individual personally. This is essential to protect the employee or officer designated as the knowledge person.
- **Anti-sandbagging protection (Seller-side):** Include a provision that if Buyer knew or should have known (based on due diligence materials) that a representation was inaccurate, Buyer waives any claim based on such representation. This is the companion provision to the knowledge definition — it shifts the burden of known information to Buyer.

**Preferred anti-sandbagging language:**

> Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event the Closing occurs, Buyer hereby expressly waives, relinquishes, and releases any right or remedy available to it at law, in equity, or under this Agreement to make a claim against Seller for damages that Buyer may incur, or to rescind this Agreement, as the result of any of Seller's representations or warranties being untrue, inaccurate, or incorrect if (1) Buyer knew that such representation or warranty was untrue, inaccurate, or incorrect at the time of the Closing and Buyer nevertheless closed title hereunder, or (2) Buyer's damages as a result of such representations or warranties being untrue, inaccurate, or incorrect are, in the aggregate, less than $[AMOUNT].

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The Knowledge definition should include multiple named individuals, a duty of reasonable inquiry, and imputed knowledge of files and records.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept naming two individuals (but no more), both of whom are employees of Seller (not the property manager). Retain "actual knowledge without duty of inquiry."
2. Accept a "deemed to know" provision that imputes knowledge of information expressly contained in the Leases and Contracts (but not the entirety of Seller's files or the due diligence materials).
3. Accept a "reasonable inquiry" standard only if coupled with a robust anti-sandbagging provision, a short survival period (6-9 months), and a meaningful claim cap and de minimis threshold.
4. Never accept imputation of the property manager's knowledge — the property manager is a third-party contractor and its knowledge should not be attributed to Seller.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — The Knowledge definition is the single most important definition for Seller's risk exposure under the PSA. A broad knowledge definition (multiple individuals, duty of inquiry, imputed knowledge) can make Seller effectively strictly liable for every fact about the Property. A narrow definition preserves Seller's ability to make knowledge-qualified representations without open-ended risk.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily (large portfolio):** The on-site property manager likely knows more about the property than anyone else. Seller must resist imputing this knowledge, as it effectively makes every representation unqualified.
- **Data Center:** Environmental and safety compliance knowledge should be limited to what the Designated Seller Representative actually knows, not what the facilities engineer or environmental consultant knows.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Fraud exception (all states):** Regardless of the contractual knowledge definition, fraud claims may not be contractually waived in many jurisdictions. The knowledge definition governs the scope of contractual representations, but does not necessarily shield Seller from fraud-based claims.

---

## Material / Materiality Definition

### Preferred Position

Seller should push for a qualitative (not quantitative) materiality standard, with broad carve-outs that ensure general market deterioration, changes in law, and force majeure events do not constitute a Material Adverse Effect. If a quantitative threshold is required, it should be high relative to the Purchase Price.

**Preferred sample language (with carve-outs):**

> "Material Adverse Effect" shall mean an effect, event, development, or change first occurring after end of the Study Period that, individually or in the aggregate with all other effects, events, developments, or changes first occurring after the end of the Study Period, is materially adverse to the business, results of operations, or financial condition of the Property, taken as a whole, other than any effect, event, development, or change arising out of or resulting from (a) changes in conditions in the U.S. or global economy or capital or financial markets generally, including changes in interest or exchange rates, (b) changes in general legal, tax, regulatory, political, or business conditions that generally affect the geographic region the Property is located in or the commercial real estate industry, (c) changes in tax or accounting rules or principles, (d) the negotiation, execution, announcement, or performance of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (e) acts of war, armed hostilities, sabotage, or terrorism, (f) earthquakes, hurricanes, pandemics, or other natural disasters, (g) any action taken by Purchaser or any of its agents, representatives, or affiliates, or (h) any action taken by Seller at the request of, or with the consent of, Purchaser.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Temporal limitation:** The definition should only capture events "first occurring after" a specified date (typically the end of the study period or the Effective Date). This ensures that conditions known at signing do not constitute an MAE.
- **Broad carve-outs:** The carve-outs listed above are Seller's primary protection. Each one removes a category of risk from the MAE trigger, ensuring Seller cannot be penalized for macroeconomic conditions, market shifts, or force majeure events.
- **No "disproportionate impact" exception:** Buyer will push for a provision that the carve-outs do not apply if the event affects the Property "disproportionately" relative to comparable properties. Seller should resist this exception, as it re-introduces the very risks the carve-outs were designed to exclude.
- **"Taken as a whole" standard:** This ensures that minor adverse effects on individual components of the Property do not constitute an MAE — the test is the aggregate impact on the Property as a whole.
- **Qualitative over quantitative:** Seller should resist a dollar threshold. Qualitative standards ("materially adverse") give Seller more room to argue that a particular event does not rise to the level of an MAE.
- **Interaction with closing conditions:** The MAE definition typically appears as a condition to Buyer's obligation to close. A narrow MAE definition (broad carve-outs, qualitative standard) reduces Buyer's ability to refuse to close.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The MAE definition should include a quantitative threshold (1-2% of Purchase Price), should limit carve-outs, and should include a "disproportionate impact" exception.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept a "disproportionate impact" exception, but only for carve-outs (e) and (f) (war/terrorism and natural disasters), not for general economic or market carve-outs.
2. Accept a quantitative threshold only for post-closing indemnification claims (not for the closing condition), at a level of 3-5% of the Purchase Price.
3. Accept removal of one or two carve-outs that are least likely to be relevant (e.g., changes in accounting rules), but retain the core carve-outs for market conditions, changes in law, and force majeure.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — The MAE definition directly controls whether Buyer can refuse to close based on changed conditions. A narrow MAE definition (Seller's preferred position) maximizes closing certainty.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Delaware entity law:** Delaware courts have provided helpful guidance on MAE interpretation (*Akorn v. Fresenius*). While technically applicable to entity acquisitions, these principles inform real estate PSA negotiations as well.

## Affiliate Definition

### Preferred Position

Seller should define "Affiliate" narrowly to limit the scope of its OFAC/sanctions representations and to constrain the assignment rights it grants to Buyer.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Affiliate" means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such Person. For purposes of this definition, "control" means the direct or indirect ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting interests of the subject entity.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **50% ownership threshold:** Using a 50% ownership threshold (rather than the "power to direct or cause direction" standard) narrows the definition and excludes minority investors, fund limited partners, and portfolio companies that Seller does not majority-own.
- **Limit OFAC exposure:** Seller's OFAC/sanctions representation applies to Seller and its Affiliates. A narrow Affiliate definition limits the scope of entities Seller must screen for sanctions compliance.
- **Buyer assignment:** From Seller's perspective, the Affiliate definition should also constrain who Buyer can assign to without consent. A narrow definition ensures that only entities truly under Buyer's control can receive the assignment.
- **Exculpation scope:** The Affiliate definition may define the scope of Seller's exculpation/limited liability provision. A broader definition protects more Seller-related parties from personal liability.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The Affiliate definition should use the "power to direct or cause direction" standard (without a percentage threshold) to capture all entities under common control.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept the "power to direct or cause direction" standard but add a minimum ownership threshold (e.g., 10% or more of voting interests) as an additional requirement.
2. Accept a broader Affiliate definition for the exculpation/limited liability provision (which benefits Seller) but retain a narrower definition for OFAC representations.
3. Accept Buyer's broader Affiliate definition if Buyer's assignment provision includes a notice requirement and Buyer remains liable.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — The Affiliate definition is a supporting definition. The primary risk is in the OFAC/sanctions representation, where an overly broad definition could require Seller to screen hundreds of entities.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- No material jurisdictional variation.

## Permitted Exceptions

### Preferred Position

Seller should push for a broad Permitted Exceptions definition that provides maximum closing certainty. Ideally, the definition should capture all existing title conditions, with limited categories of mandatory cure items.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Permitted Exceptions" shall mean: (a) applicable zoning, subdivision, building, and other land use laws and regulations; (b) all matters reflecting the existence or terms of Leases shown on the Lease Schedule or entered into after the Effective Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (c) all matters, whether or not of record, that arise out of the actions of Purchaser or its agents, representatives, or contractors; (d) the lien of real estate taxes and assessments not yet due and payable, subject to adjustment as provided herein; (e) any installation, service, connection, usage, or maintenance charges for utilities; (f) all matters that the Title Company is willing to insure over without additional premium or indemnity from Purchaser; (g) any lien or encumbrance that is the responsibility of a Tenant under its Lease; (h) standard pre-printed exceptions and provisions contained in title insurance policies; and (i) all other matters shown on or referenced in the Title Commitment (other than Voluntary Liens) or the Survey, all matters of record as of the Effective Date, such state of facts as would be disclosed by a physical inspection of the Real Property or an ALTA "as-built" survey of the Real Property as of the Title Objection Date, and all other matters affecting title to the Real Property within Purchaser's Knowledge as of the Title Objection Date, except for those matters in this subsection (i) as to which Purchaser makes a written objection on or before the Title Objection Date and Seller elects to use reasonable efforts to Remove.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Blanket inclusion of existing conditions:** Subsection (i) is the key Seller protection — it deems as Permitted Exceptions all existing matters of record, physical conditions, and survey conditions, subject only to Buyer's timely written objection.
- **"Voluntary Liens" carve-out:** Seller should accept an obligation to remove its own voluntary monetary liens (mortgages, deeds of trust, judgment liens) at Closing. This is market standard and expected.
- **"Reasonable efforts" (not absolute obligation) to remove:** Seller should be required only to use "reasonable efforts" to remove non-monetary title objections, not an absolute obligation to cure. If removal cannot be achieved through reasonable efforts, Buyer's remedy should be limited to termination (not specific performance of the cure).
- **Insurable matters:** Include a provision that matters the title company is willing to insure over (without additional premium to Buyer) are Permitted Exceptions. This provides Seller with a cure mechanism — if Seller cannot remove an exception, it can negotiate with the title company to insure over it.
- **Tight objection deadlines:** Seller should push for short title objection periods (5-10 Business Days from receipt of the commitment) and strict deemed-approval provisions (failure to object equals approval).
- **Remove/cure definition:** Define "Remove" as causing the title company to remove or affirmatively insure over the exception without additional cost or liability to Buyer. This gives Seller flexibility — it can cure the underlying defect or simply obtain title insurance coverage.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The Permitted Exceptions definition should be narrow (limited to taxes, tenant rights, and buyer-approved exceptions), with broad mandatory cure categories and adequate time for title review.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept a narrower blanket inclusion (eliminate "such state of facts as would be disclosed by physical inspection") but retain the catch-all for matters of record and survey matters.
2. Accept longer title objection periods (10-15 Business Days) if the Closing Date accommodates the timeline.
3. Accept that Seller's obligation to remove includes an expenditure cap (e.g., $100,000-$250,000) for non-monetary exceptions, after which Seller can elect not to cure and Buyer can terminate.
4. Accept that mechanics' and materialmen's liens arising from Seller's actions are mandatory cure items (in addition to voluntary monetary liens).

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — The Permitted Exceptions definition is Seller's primary tool for closing certainty on title matters. A narrow definition gives Buyer excessive leverage to terminate or extract concessions based on title conditions that existed when the deal was struck.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Title practice in NY is attorney-intensive. Sellers should expect longer title review periods and more granular title objections than in escrow states.
- **California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado:** Title insurance practice is escrow-based and typically more streamlined. Shorter objection periods are reasonable.
- **Title insurance availability varies:** In some jurisdictions, title companies are more willing to insure over defects than in others. Seller's ability to rely on the "insure over" mechanism depends on local title company practices.

## Effective Date Mechanics

### Preferred Position

Seller should push for an Effective Date that is clearly defined and triggers all subsequent deadlines. Seller's primary concern is that the Effective Date not be subject to delay by the buyer.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Effective Date" means the date underneath the signature of Seller and Purchaser on the signature page of this Agreement; provided, however, that if such dates are different, the latest of such dates shall be the Effective Date.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Signature-date trigger:** Tying the Effective Date to the signature dates is objective and non-manipulable. Resist mechanisms that allow Buyer to delay effectiveness (e.g., "the date Buyer delivers the executed agreement to Escrow Agent").
- **Fixed deadlines vs. running periods:** Where possible, Seller should push for fixed-date deadlines (e.g., "Closing shall occur on September 29, 2021") rather than running periods ("30 days after the Effective Date"). Fixed dates give Seller more certainty and are not affected by disputes over the Effective Date.
- **Day-for-day extensions:** Resist buyer demands for day-for-day extensions of the diligence period based on late delivery of due diligence materials. If Seller must accept such extensions, cap the maximum extension period.
- **"Not an offer" clause:** Include this for Seller's protection as well, to prevent claims that Seller's circulation of the PSA constituted a binding offer.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The Effective Date should trigger running periods (so that Buyer's diligence period is not compressed by signing delays), and Buyer should get day-for-day extensions for late delivery of materials.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept running periods (days from Effective Date) for the diligence period, but use fixed dates for the Closing Date.
2. Accept day-for-day extensions for late delivery of due diligence materials, but cap the total extension at 5-10 Business Days and require Buyer to give notice of the claimed delay.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Effective Date disputes are uncommon in institutional transactions. The risk is procedural and is mitigated by clear drafting.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Same as Buyer Playbook.

## Parties Identification and SPE Requirements

### Preferred Position

Seller should ensure its identity is correctly stated, should limit its representations regarding authority and good standing to its own organizational structure, and should control the scope of Buyer's assignment rights.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Seller identification:** Ensure Seller's legal name in the PSA exactly matches the name on the vesting deed. If the Property is held by multiple entities, all must be named as Seller.
- **Limited liability/exculpation:** Include a provision that limits recourse to the assets of the Seller entity — no personal liability for Seller's members, managers, officers, directors, employees, or agents. This is the "Seller Parties" exculpation and is critical for institutional sellers.

**Preferred exculpation language:**

> Neither the members, managers, employees, or agents of Seller, nor the shareholders, officers, directors, employees, or agents of any of them, shall be liable under this Agreement and all parties hereto shall look solely to the assets of Seller for the payment of any claim or the performance of any obligation by Seller.

- **Buyer assignment restrictions:** Seller should retain consent rights over any assignment of the PSA. The typical compromise is that Buyer may assign to an Affiliate or SPE without consent, but Seller requires: (a) prior written notice, (b) the assignee assumes all of Buyer's obligations, and (c) Buyer remains liable notwithstanding the assignment.
- **SPE assignee requirements:** If Buyer assigns to an SPE, Seller should require that the SPE be duly organized, in good standing, and authorized to consummate the transaction. Seller should also require that Buyer remain liable as guarantor or co-obligor.
- **Multiple Sellers (joint and several vs. several):** If there are multiple Seller entities, Seller should push for "several" (not "joint and several") liability, with each Seller responsible only for its proportionate share of obligations.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Assignment to an Affiliate or SPE should be freely permitted without consent or conditions, and Seller should have no right to approve the assignee.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept assignment to Affiliates without consent if Buyer provides at least 2-5 Business Days prior written notice and Buyer remains liable.
2. Accept that Buyer need not remain liable post-assignment if the assignee is a creditworthy institutional entity.
3. Accept a broader definition of permitted assignees (including co-investment vehicles and TIC structures) if Buyer provides notice and an Affiliate of Buyer serves as property manager.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — The primary risk is that Buyer assigns to a thinly capitalized SPE that cannot perform Buyer's obligations (including post-closing purchase price adjustments and indemnification obligations). Requiring Buyer to remain liable mitigates this risk.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Transfer taxes (NY, CT, DC, PA):** Assignment of a PSA may trigger transfer tax in some jurisdictions. Seller should ensure that any transfer tax liability resulting from Buyer's assignment is borne by Buyer.
- **Delaware:** Most institutional SPEs are Delaware LLCs. Seller should accept Delaware LLCs as assignees.

## Excluded Items / Seller Reserved Rights

### Preferred Position

Seller should maintain a comprehensive Excluded Items definition that captures all items Seller intends to retain. The definition should be part of the PSA at signing (not left as a blank schedule) and should be robust enough to protect Seller's portfolio-level assets and privileged materials.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Excluded Items" shall mean: (a) materials relating to the marketing efforts for the sale of the Property, including communications and agreements with other potential purchasers; (b) projections and other internal memoranda or materials; (c) communications between Seller (or its advisors or affiliates) and the property manager and/or leasing broker for the Property; (d) appraisals, budgets, strategic plans for the Property, internal analyses, computer software, and submissions relating to the obtaining of internal authorizations, and engineering and environmental reports received by Seller or its affiliates or advisors; (e) attorney and accountant work product, and all other materials subject to any legal privilege in favor of Seller; (f) organizational documents of the Seller Parties and any agreements and communications between Seller and any affiliate or advisor of Seller; and (g) the personal property located in the on-site management office or elsewhere used by the current property manager for the Property and not owned by Seller.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Marketing materials:** Seller must exclude all marketing materials, including communications with other potential purchasers, to protect the confidentiality of Seller's sale process and avoid claims that Seller solicited competing offers.
- **Internal analyses and projections:** These are proprietary and should not transfer. Buyer receives actual financial data (operating statements, rent rolls) through diligence — not Seller's projections or valuations.
- **Privileged materials:** Attorney-client privilege belongs to Seller and must be preserved. The Excluded Items definition is the appropriate place to protect it.
- **Property manager's property:** The property manager's personal property (computers, software, phones, furniture in the management office) belongs to the property manager, not Seller. Excluding it avoids a claim that Seller is conveying third-party property.
- **Environmental reports:** Some sellers exclude environmental reports received by Seller's advisors or affiliates. This is aggressive — Buyer will push back, as it may believe Seller is hiding adverse environmental information. Be prepared to share environmental reports through diligence while retaining ownership of the report itself.

### Counterparty Pushback & Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Environmental reports, engineering reports, and other third-party reports should transfer with the Property. Buyer will also argue that the Excluded Items definition is too broad and could encompass operationally necessary items.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept that third-party environmental and engineering reports are not excluded if they are in Seller's possession and were commissioned for the Property (not for Seller's internal use). Retain exclusion of reports commissioned by Seller's advisors for internal investment committee purposes.
2. Accept that the Excluded Items definition will not apply to items that are "necessary for the ongoing operation and management of the Property" — but require Buyer to identify any such items during diligence.
3. Remove the exclusion for property manager's personal property if Seller's management agreement provides that such property belongs to Seller (not the manager).

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — The risk of an inadequate Excluded Items definition is that Seller inadvertently conveys materials it intended to retain — particularly privileged communications, strategic analyses, and proprietary management systems.
