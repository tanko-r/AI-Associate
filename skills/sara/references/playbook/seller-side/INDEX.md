**File:** `01-definitions-and-property-description.md`

| Subtopic | Risk | Summary |
|----------|------|---------|
| Property Definition Breadth | HIGH | An overbroad Property definition can require Seller to convey assets it did not intend to sell, create title and conv... |
| Real Property (Land and Improvements) | MEDIUM | The primary risk is warranting title to rights Seller does not own (especially mineral rights and development rights). |
| Appurtenances | MEDIUM | The risk is limited if Seller conveys by special warranty deed, as Seller only warrants against claims arising through Seller. |
| Personal Property Inclusions and Exclusions | LOW | Personal property disputes are typically low-value. |
| Intangible Property | MEDIUM | The primary risk for Seller is inadvertently conveying assets it intended to retain (portfolio-level assets) or warra... |

| Assumed Contracts Definition and Mechanism | MEDIUM | The primary risk for Seller is being obligated to pay early termination penalties for contracts that were disclosed d... |
| Business Day Definition | LOW | The Business Day definition is a technical provision that rarely drives deal outcomes, but it can create procedural l... |
| Knowledge Definition | CRITICAL | The Knowledge definition is the single most important definition for Seller's risk exposure under the PSA. |
| Material / Materiality Definition | HIGH | The MAE definition directly controls whether Buyer can refuse to close based on changed conditions. |
| Affiliate Definition | LOW | The Affiliate definition is a supporting definition. |
| Permitted Exceptions | CRITICAL | The Permitted Exceptions definition is Seller's primary tool for closing certainty on title matters. |
| Effective Date Mechanics | LOW | Effective Date disputes are uncommon in institutional transactions. |
| Parties Identification and SPE Requirements | MEDIUM | The primary risk is that Buyer assigns to a thinly capitalized SPE that cannot perform Buyer's obligations (including... |

## 02 — Purchase Price, Deposits, and Payment Mechanics
**Checklist categories:** 3 (Purchase Price and Deposits)
**File:** `02-purchase-price-and-deposits.md`

| Subtopic | Risk | Summary |
|----------|------|---------|
| Purchase Price Structure | HIGH | Any mechanism that allows the buyer to reduce the purchase price after the LOI stage erodes deal certainty. |
| Earnest Money Deposit Amount and Timing | CRITICAL | The deposit is the seller's primary protection against a buyer who ties up the property and then walks away. |
| Independent Contract Consideration ($100 Hard Money) | LOW | The $100 amount is immaterial, but the legal protection it provides for enforceability of the option period is important, particularly in Texas. |
| Deposit Going Hard Mechanics | CRITICAL | The going-hard mechanic determines when seller achieves certainty that the deal will close. |
| Additional Deposits | HIGH | The additional deposit is a key mechanism for increasing buyer's skin in the game after the free-look period ends. |
| Interest on Deposits | LOW | Not a material negotiation point. |
| Escrow Agent Selection and Duties | MEDIUM | Escrow agent procedures are important but rarely the source of deal-breaking disputes. |
| Payment of Purchase Price at Closing (Wire Transfer Mechanics) | HIGH | The seller's primary objective at closing is to receive the full purchase price in immediately available funds. |
| Purchase Price Allocation (Personal Property vs. Real Property) | MEDIUM | The allocation issue is important for tax planning but rarely a deal-breaker. |
| Existing Loan Assumption Mechanics | CRITICAL | In assumption transactions, the seller's exposure continues until the guarantors are released. |
| Purchase Price Adjustments and Prorations | HIGH | Proration disputes are among the most common post-closing conflicts. |
| Closing Date Extension Mechanics | HIGH | Seller's primary risk is buyer endlessly delaying closing while holding the property off market. |
| Liquidated Damages and Default Remedies | CRITICAL | The default and remedies provisions define seller's maximum exposure and control the consequences of deal failure. |
| Liability Limitations and Exculpation | HIGH | Without proper exculpation and liability limitations, seller's principals face personal exposure for post-closing cla... |

## 03 — Due Diligence and Inspections
**Checklist categories:** 4 (Due Diligence and Inspections)
**File:** `03-due-diligence-and-inspections.md`

| Subtopic | Risk | Summary |
|----------|------|---------|
| Due Diligence Period Length and Structure | HIGH | - risk: Long DD period (60+ days) with no commitment from buyer. |
| DD Deadline Mechanics: Deemed Approval on Silence | LOW | - risk: Deemed approval on silence is enforceable in virtually all jurisdictions and protects seller from buyer's procrastination. |
| Seller's Delivery Obligations: Controlling the Scope | LOW | - risk: Seller controls the scope of delivery and includes a broad disclaimer. |
| Site Visit and Physical Inspection Rights | LOW | - risk: Standard access provisions adequately protect seller's interests while providing buyer with necessary information. |

| Return of DD Materials on Termination | LOW | - risk: Return of DD materials is largely administrative. |
| Environmental Assessments (Phase I / Phase II) -- Seller's Perspective | HIGH | - risk: If seller is aware of unremediated contamination and fails to disclose, seller faces fraud liability regardless of the as-is provision. |
| Zoning and Entitlement Review -- Seller's Perspective | HIGH | - risk: Buyer triggering a building inspection that reveals code violations, resulting in enforcement action against seller before closing. |
| Financial Audit Rights -- Seller's Perspective | LOW | - risk: Financial DD access is standard and buyer needs this information to underwrite the deal. |
| Buyer's Right to Extend DD Period -- Seller's Perspective | MEDIUM | - risk: Extension rights keep the property off market for longer and create uncertainty for seller. |
| DD Materials Disclaimer and AS-IS Provisions | LOW | - risk: Comprehensive as-is and release provisions significantly limit seller's post-closing exposure. |
| Seller's Excluded Materials | LOW | - risk: Excluded Materials provisions are standard in institutional deals and rarely litigated. |
| Effect of Prior Early Access Agreements | LOW | - risk if addressed: Clean supersession eliminates ambiguity. |

| Permitted Exceptions Definition and Negotiation | CRITICAL | - risk for Seller: A narrowly defined Permitted Exceptions definition gives Buyer broad objection rights and multiple termination hooks. |
| Survey Requirements | LOW | - risk for Seller: Survey obligations are minimal. |

| Title Insurance Requirements | LOW | - risk for Seller: Title insurance provisions are well-established and rarely create closing uncertainty for Seller. |

| Simultaneous Issue of Lender's Policy | LOW | - risk for Seller: Lender's policy issues are Buyer's problem. |

|----------|------|---------|
| PART ONE: SELLER REPRESENTATIONS -- SCOPE AND LIMITATION | — | No risk assessment provided |

| No Litigation | — | Overly broad litigation representations expose Seller to post-closing claims based on routine property-level disputes. |
| Compliance with Laws / No Violations | — | A compliance representation is one of the most dangerous representations for Seller because non-compliance with obscu... |
| Environmental Matters | — | Environmental liability is CERCLA strict liability -- the current owner is liable regardless of fault. |
| Leases | — | Lease representations are the most frequently litigated post-closing claims. |
| Contracts | LOW | Contract-related representations carry relatively risk because Buyer designates which contracts to assume. |
| Condemnation and Tax Appeals | LOW | risk if Seller accurately discloses pending and threatened proceedings. |
| FIRPTA / Tax Withholding | — | None if the representation is accurate. |
| OFAC / Anti-Money Laundering | LOW | risk if Seller has conducted appropriate OFAC screening. |
| Bankruptcy / Solvency | — | The bankruptcy representation itself carries minimal risk. |

| Financial Statements and No Fraudulent Concealment | — | Financial statement representations expose Seller to claims of misrepresentation if any line item is inaccurate, even... |
| PART TWO: BUYER REPRESENTATIONS -- SCOPE AND EXPANSION | — | No risk assessment provided |
| Buyer's Organization, Authority, and Non-Contravention | — | These representations protect Seller against a Buyer that lacks authority to close, which could leave Seller stranded at the closing table. |
| Buyer's OFAC / AML Compliance | — | Receiving the proceeds of money laundering or transacting with a sanctioned person exposes Seller to criminal liability. |
| Buyer's ERISA Status | — | ERISA prohibited transaction liability includes excise taxes of 15% per year on the amount involved, plus potential p... |
| Buyer's Sophistication and Experience | — | This representation is a prophylactic measure that supports the enforceability of the as-is clause and liability limitations. |
| PART THREE: CRITICAL MECHANICAL ISSUES -- SELLER'S PERSPECTIVE | — | No risk assessment provided |
| Knowledge Qualifiers | — | The knowledge qualifier is Seller's primary tool for limiting the scope of representations. |
| Materiality Qualifiers | — | The materiality qualifier is Seller's second most important limitation (after the knowledge qualifier). |
| Survival Period and Limitations | — | The survival period directly determines Seller's post-closing exposure window. |
| Bring-Down at Closing | — | The bring-down certificate is a potential trap for Seller if the knowledge individual cannot truthfully certify that all representations remain true. |
| Update Rights and Obligations | — | The update mechanism is Seller's key tool for managing the gap between signing and closing. |
| Anti-Sandbagging | — | In pro-sandbagging jurisdictions, the absence of an express anti-sandbagging clause means Buyer can close with full k... |
| Liability Cap | — | The liability cap is the ultimate backstop limiting Seller's exposure. |
| Basket / Deductible | — | The deductible/basket is a cost-of-doing-business allocation. |
| Interaction with As-Is Clause | — | The as-is clause is Seller's most powerful protection. |
| Schedule Disclosure Mechanics | — | The schedule disclosure mechanics determine what Seller must specifically identify versus what is deemed already disclosed. |

| Remedy for Breach | — | The remedy provisions are the enforcement mechanism for the representations. |

|----------|------|---------|
| General Maintenance and Operation Standard | MEDIUM | An over-broad maintenance covenant can create an easy default trigger for a buyer seeking to exit the deal. |

| Leasing Restrictions — Consent Standards | HIGH | Overly restrictive leasing covenants can cause Seller to lose prospective tenants during the interim period, reducing... |
| New Lease Approval Mechanics — Deemed Approval | HIGH | The absence of a deemed-approval provision — or one with broad exceptions — can effectively give Buyer a veto over Seller's leasing program. |

| Employee Matters — Seller's Protections | MEDIUM | LOW-WARN Act exposure is real but manageable with proper planning. |

**File:** `07-conditions-precedent.md`

| Subtopic | Risk | Summary |
|----------|------|---------|
| Buyer Representations and Warranties True at Closing | MODERATE | Buyer's representations are narrower in scope than seller's, and the risk that buyer's representations become untrue is lower. |
| Buyer Delivery of Purchase Price | CRITICAL | Without confirmation of good funds, seller risks recording the deed and transferring title without receiving payment. |
| Buyer Delivery of Closing Documents | MODERATE | Buyer's document delivery failure is typically a symptom of a larger problem (buyer's inability or unwillingness to close). |

| Mutual Conditions | LOW | Mutual conditions are relatively rare and typically non-controversial. |
| Title Policy Condition — Seller's Perspective | MODERATE | The title policy condition is universal and non-controversial. |

| Seller's Closing Extension Rights | MODERATE | The closing extension right is seller's insurance policy against condition failures. |
| Financing as a Non-Condition — Seller's Position | CRITICAL | A financing contingency gives buyer a free exit right that seller cannot control. |
