# Representations and Warranties -- Seller Side Playbook

This playbook addresses the negotiation of representations and warranties in a purchase and sale agreement for institutional commercial real estate dispositions ($50M+), from the seller's perspective. The seller's overarching objective is to minimize the scope, duration, and enforceability of seller representations, maximize the protective effect of knowledge qualifiers and liability limitations, and ensure that the as-is clause and anti-sandbagging provisions limit post-closing exposure.

---

## PART ONE: SELLER REPRESENTATIONS -- SCOPE AND LIMITATION

---

## 1. Organization and Authority

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that it is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing. This Agreement has been duly authorized and constitutes a legal, valid, and binding obligation. The representation is limited to the Effective Date and as of Closing and is subject to equitable principles and principles governing creditors' rights generally.

### Key Negotiation Points
- This is a fundamental representation that Seller must provide. Do not resist it -- resistance signals weakness and raises title insurer concerns.
- Include the standard "subject to equitable principles and principles governing creditors' rights generally" qualifier. This is boilerplate but important -- it prevents the representation from being construed as a guarantee of enforceability in all circumstances.
- If Seller is a newly formed SPE, the representation as stated is accurate and should be given without qualification. No need to provide organizational history.
- Do NOT volunteer representations about Seller's capitalization, net worth, solvency, or financial condition unless specifically requested, and resist those requests when made (discussed under Bankruptcy/Solvency below).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer requests that Seller represent good standing in the state where the Property is located, in addition to the state of formation.
- **Fallback**: Provide the representation if Seller is in fact qualified in the Property's state. If not, qualify to do business before Closing (which is typically a ministerial filing) and deliver the foreign qualification certificate as a closing deliverable, rather than making it a representation.
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on delivery of organizational documents, resolutions, and certificates of good standing.
- **Fallback**: Agree to deliver these as closing deliverables (which is standard) rather than making them the subject of a representation. The title company will require these anyway.

### Risk Assessment
This is a low-risk representation for Seller. If Seller IS duly organized and authorized, there is no downside to making the representation. The risk of breach is virtually zero for a properly formed entity with appropriate internal authorizations.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation. This representation is identical across all asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Same as Buyer Side analysis. Ensure foreign entity qualification in the Property's state if required.

---

## 2. No Conflicts

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that the execution and delivery of the Agreement will not violate any law, judgment, or order applicable to Seller, or conflict with Seller's organizational documents, or constitute a default under any material agreement to which Seller is a party. Qualify with "in any material respect" where possible.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Include a materiality qualifier: "will not in any material respect violate..." This prevents a technical, immaterial conflict from constituting a breach.
- If there is an existing loan with a due-on-sale clause, expressly carve it out: "Except for the Existing Loan Assumption Approval needed for assumption of the Existing Loan." Both UNICO forms include this optional carve-out.
- If there are REA provisions, ground lease restrictions, or other third-party consents required, disclose them on a schedule and carve them out of the flat representation, with a separate covenant to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consents.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on a flat representation with no materiality qualifier, arguing that any conflict could impair closing.
- **Fallback**: Accept the removal of "material" if Seller is confident that no conflicts exist, but add a disclosure schedule listing any items that could arguably constitute a conflict (e.g., existing loan, REA notice requirements). Disclosed items are then Permitted Exceptions to the representation.

### Risk Assessment
The primary risk is an undisclosed loan covenant or REA restriction that is triggered by the sale. Seller's counsel should review all loan documents, REA agreements, and organizational documents before signing to confirm the accuracy of this representation.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Retail**: REAs are common and frequently contain ROFR, consent, or notice provisions triggered by a sale. Identify and carve out these provisions.
- **Office**: Ground leases may contain transfer restrictions.
- **Data Centers**: Fiber and power agreements may contain change-of-control or assignment restrictions.

### Jurisdictional Notes
No significant variation, but verify state-specific notice or consent requirements for transfers of interests in LLCs and partnerships.

---

## 3. No Litigation

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that Seller is not a party to any action, litigation, suit, arbitration, or governmental proceeding that would affect Seller's ability to execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under this Agreement. To Seller's knowledge, no such matter is threatened against the Property or Seller. Limit the scope to proceedings that would affect Seller's ability to perform -- NOT all proceedings affecting the Property.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Narrow the scope**: The UNICO Seller Side form limits the litigation representation to proceedings "that would affect Seller's ability to execute, deliver and perform all of its obligations under this Agreement." This is the seller's strongest formulation -- it excludes routine property-level litigation (slip-and-fall, tenant disputes, code enforcement) that does not impair the seller's ability to close.
- **Knowledge qualifier on threatened matters**: Apply "to Seller's knowledge" to threatened (as opposed to pending) litigation. The distinction is: pending litigation is a matter of public record and Seller should represent it flatly; threatened litigation requires Seller to have received some communication, which should be knowledge-qualified.
- **Materiality threshold**: If Buyer insists on a broader litigation representation covering all proceedings affecting the Property, add a materiality threshold. The Meadows form uses "$50,000 in the aggregate" as the materiality threshold. This is reasonable -- it excludes routine small claims while capturing significant disputes.
- **Insurance coverage carve-out**: Carve out matters being defended by Seller's insurance carriers. If a slip-and-fall claim is fully insured and the carrier has accepted defense without reservation of rights, there is no risk to Buyer.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on disclosure of ALL litigation affecting the Property, regardless of materiality.
- **Fallback**: Accept disclosure of all pending and known threatened litigation on a schedule, but maintain the materiality threshold for purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred. Disclosure does not equal breach -- Seller can disclose a $10,000 slip-and-fall claim without breaching the representation, as long as the representation is qualified by materiality.
- **Pushback**: Buyer rejects the "affects Seller's ability to perform" limitation and wants coverage of proceedings affecting the Property.
- **Fallback**: Accept coverage of proceedings that "would materially and adversely affect the value of the Property" (the Meadows formulation), but resist coverage of all proceedings regardless of impact.

### Risk Assessment
Overly broad litigation representations expose Seller to post-closing claims based on routine property-level disputes. The risk is not that Seller will lose the underlying litigation -- it is that the mere existence of undisclosed litigation constitutes a breach of representation, triggering the remedies provisions. Use disclosure schedules aggressively.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily**: High volume of routine disputes (security deposit claims, habitability complaints, eviction proceedings). A materiality threshold is essential.
- **Retail**: Slip-and-fall claims and ADA lawsuits are frequent. The insurance carve-out is particularly important.
- **Industrial**: Environmental enforcement actions are the primary concern. Disclose and carve out.

### Jurisdictional Notes
Same as Buyer Side analysis. Ensure that the governing law's definition of "threatened" litigation is consistent with the contractual formulation.

---

## 4. Compliance with Laws / No Violations

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that Seller has not received any written notification from any insurance company, governmental authority, or public agency that the Property is in violation of applicable laws, where such violation has not been cured. No broader compliance representation.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Notice-based, not compliance-based**: Seller should represent only that it has not received NOTICE of violations, not that the Property actually COMPLIES with all laws. Compliance is a factual question that depends on engineering analysis, code review, and physical inspection -- matters within Buyer's due diligence responsibility. The UNICO forms correctly limit this to "written notification."
- **"Which has not been cured" qualifier**: Essential. Seller should not breach this representation for historical violations that have been remediated.
- **Written notice only**: Limit to written (not oral) notice. Oral communications with building inspectors, fire marshals, etc. should not constitute "notice" for purposes of this representation.
- **No duty to investigate**: Seller should not have any obligation to investigate compliance beyond responding to notices received. Compliance verification is Buyer's responsibility during due diligence.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer wants a knowledge-qualified representation that the Property complies with all applicable laws.
- **Fallback**: If market conditions require a broader representation, accept "to Seller's knowledge, Seller has not received notice of any material non-compliance" -- but insist that (1) it is qualified by knowledge, (2) it is limited to notices received (not actual compliance), (3) it includes a materiality qualifier, and (4) the knowledge individual has no duty to inquire beyond reviewing Seller's files. Do NOT accept a flat representation of compliance.

### Risk Assessment
A compliance representation is one of the most dangerous representations for Seller because non-compliance with obscure regulations (fire code, ADA, environmental, zoning) may exist without Seller's knowledge. The as-is clause is specifically designed to allocate this risk to Buyer.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **All types**: The risk of undiscovered non-compliance varies by property age, type, and regulatory environment. Older buildings have more potential non-compliance.
- **Multifamily**: Housing codes, lead paint regulations, and rent stabilization rules create dense regulatory environments where non-compliance is common.
- **Data Centers**: Electrical codes, fire suppression standards, and environmental regulations for generator fuel storage create specialized compliance obligations.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York City**: The volume of local laws (LL11, LL26, LL84, LL87, LL97, LL152) creates a uniquely complex compliance environment. Seller should represent only as to notices received, not actual compliance.
- **California**: Title 24, Proposition 65, and local seismic retrofit requirements add layers of regulatory compliance.

---

## 5. Environmental Matters

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that Seller has received no written notice from any governmental entity regarding: (a) the existence of any Hazardous Materials on the Property in violation of any Environmental Law; or (b) the current violation of any Environmental Law with respect to the Property. Both UNICO forms use this formulation. No broader environmental representation.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Notice-based ONLY**: Do not represent as to the actual environmental condition of the Property. The Phase I/Phase II ESA process exists precisely to shift environmental risk to Buyer through the "innocent purchaser" defense under CERCLA. Seller's environmental representations should be limited to notice received.
- **Governmental entity only**: Limit the notice prong to communications from governmental entities. Do NOT extend to notices from neighboring property owners, tenants, or "any person" -- these expand the universe of "notice" beyond what Seller can reasonably track.
- **Hazardous Materials definition**: Include the standard exclusion for "solvents, cleaning fluids and other lawful substances used in the ordinary operation and maintenance of the Property." This prevents ordinary cleaning supplies and maintenance chemicals from triggering the representation.
- **No representation regarding specific substances**: Resist requests for specific representations regarding USTs, ACM, LBP, PCBs, mold, or PFAS. These are matters for Buyer's environmental consultant to investigate. If pressed, add "to Seller's knowledge" and disclose everything in the environmental reports.
- **No indemnity**: Seller should not provide a separate environmental indemnity. Environmental liability should be subject to the same survival period, cap, and basket as all other representations.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on a broader environmental representation, including a knowledge representation regarding the actual presence of Hazardous Materials.
- **Fallback**: If market conditions require, accept: "To Seller's knowledge, no Hazardous Materials exist on the Property in violation of Environmental Law, except as disclosed in the environmental reports delivered to Buyer." This is knowledge-qualified, limited to violations (not mere presence), and subject to the disclosure of environmental reports. Every environmental report will disclose some level of contamination concern, making this representation heavily qualified in practice.
- **Pushback**: Buyer wants a longer survival period for environmental representations.
- **Fallback**: If a longer survival period is required for environmental representations, limit the extended period to matters not disclosed in the environmental reports, and cap the extended-period liability at a lower amount than the general liability cap.

### Risk Assessment
Environmental liability is CERCLA strict liability -- the current owner is liable regardless of fault. Seller's best protection is the as-is clause, the release of claims (including environmental liability), and the limiting of environmental representations to notice received. The Meadows form includes a comprehensive environmental release: "Buyer...hereby releases Seller and Seller Parties...from, and waives all claims and liability, including Environmental Liability."

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: Highest environmental risk. Seller should be especially vigilant about limiting environmental representations to notice received and relying on the as-is clause and release.
- **Retail**: Gas station pads, dry cleaners, and auto service tenants create environmental exposure that should be disclosed and addressed through lease provisions (tenant environmental indemnities), not seller representations.
- **Office / Multifamily**: Lower environmental risk, but ACM in older buildings and LBP in pre-1978 multifamily are standard disclosure items.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New Jersey (ISRA)**: Transfer-triggered environmental investigation and remediation requirements. Seller must comply with ISRA regardless of the representations. Factor ISRA compliance costs into the deal terms.
- **Connecticut (Transfer Act)**: Similar transfer-triggered requirements.
- **Illinois (IRPTA)**: Requires environmental disclosure at closing. Compliance with IRPTA should be a covenant, not a representation.

---

## 6. Leases

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that: (a) the Lease Schedule lists all leases affecting the Property; (b) copies of Leases delivered are true, correct, and complete in all material respects; (c) all Leases are in full force and effect; (d) to Seller's knowledge, there are no uncured landlord or tenant defaults under the Leases; (e) security deposits are as set forth on the schedule. Qualify the entire representation with "in all material respects" and apply a knowledge qualifier to any representation regarding tenant conduct.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Apply "to Seller's knowledge" broadly**: The UNICO Seller Side form applies the knowledge qualifier to BOTH landlord AND tenant defaults: "To Seller's knowledge, there are no uncured landlord defaults or breaches or uncured tenant defaults or breaches under the Leases." While Buyer will push for a flat representation on landlord defaults, the knowledge qualifier provides additional protection because the property manager (not Seller personally) handles day-to-day lease administration.
- **Avoid representing accuracy of rent rolls**: Do not represent that rent rolls are "true, correct and complete." Instead, represent that they are "true, correct and complete in all material respects AS OF THE DATE THEREOF." The date qualifier limits the representation to a snapshot in time, not a continuing warranty.
- **Limit TI obligation representations**: Do not affirmatively represent that all TI obligations have been completed. Instead, disclose outstanding TI obligations on a schedule and represent that the schedule is "complete in all material respects." The UNICO Buyer Side form correctly requires a Leasing Costs schedule (Exhibit L), which is the proper mechanism.
- **Lease brokerage commissions**: Disclose all commission agreements on a schedule and represent that all commissions due as of the Effective Date have been paid (or will be paid at Closing). Do not represent that no future commissions will become due -- renewal commissions and expansion commissions triggered by tenant exercise of options may become due post-Closing and should be Buyer's responsibility.
- **No purchase options representation**: This should be a flat representation because Seller controls whether it grants purchase options. If a purchase option exists, disclose it.
- **Estoppels as alternative to representations**: Seller should push for tenant estoppel certificates to serve as the primary source of lease information at Closing, reducing reliance on (and exposure from) Seller's lease representations. The UNICO forms condition Closing on receipt of Conforming Tenant Estoppels from tenants covering at least 80% of leased square footage.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on a flat representation (no knowledge qualifier) regarding landlord defaults, arguing that Seller controls its own compliance.
- **Fallback**: If the property is managed by a third-party property manager, a knowledge qualifier on landlord defaults is defensible because the property manager performs the landlord's obligations on a day-to-day basis. However, if Seller is self-managing, accept a flat representation on landlord defaults -- Seller should know whether it has performed.
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on detailed representations regarding free rent, tenant improvement obligations, and concessions.
- **Fallback**: Disclose all concessions, free rent, TI obligations, and other landlord obligations on a comprehensive schedule. The schedule IS the representation. If the schedule is complete, the representation is satisfied. This concentrates the risk on the accuracy of the schedule rather than the breadth of the representation language.

### Risk Assessment
Lease representations are the most frequently litigated post-closing claims. Seller's best protection is: (1) comprehensive disclosure schedules; (2) knowledge qualifiers on tenant-side matters; (3) tenant estoppel certificates that confirm the key terms; and (4) a short survival period.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily**: Hundreds of leases on standard forms. Represent that all leases are on the standard form attached as an exhibit, with deviations disclosed.
- **Office**: Focus on free rent, TI allowances, and expansion/contraction options that represent unfunded obligations.
- **Retail**: Percentage rent, co-tenancy, exclusive use, and go-dark provisions are common points of lease disputes. Disclose all material provisions on schedules.
- **Industrial**: Typically fewer leases, but with longer terms and larger per-tenant exposure. Represent each lease individually.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York City**: Rent stabilization adds a layer of complexity. Seller should represent only that the rent roll accurately reflects the legal regulated rents as of its date, qualified by knowledge. HSTPA compliance should be addressed separately.
- **California**: AB 1482 compliance (rent caps and just-cause eviction) should be a separate disclosure item.

---

## 7. Contracts

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that the Contract Schedule lists all contracts affecting the Property that will be binding after Closing (other than Leases and Permitted Exceptions). To Seller's knowledge, there are no uncured defaults under the Contracts. All non-Assumed Contracts will be terminated at or before Closing.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Apply "to Seller's knowledge" to the no-defaults representation. Seller may not be aware of every counterparty default under every service contract.
- Ensure the representation carves out the property management agreement, which will be terminated at Closing. The UNICO Seller Side form includes this carve-out.
- Buyer will designate which contracts to assume. Seller should ensure that the Agreement places the termination cost burden on Seller only for contracts that are terminable without penalty. For contracts with early termination fees, allocate the cost to Buyer or negotiate at the deal level.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer wants a flat representation that no contracts contain anti-assignment clauses or change-of-control provisions.
- **Fallback**: Disclose any such provisions on the contract schedule and address them as part of the closing mechanics (obtaining consents, novation agreements, etc.).

### Risk Assessment
Contract-related representations carry relatively low risk because Buyer designates which contracts to assume. Seller's primary exposure is undisclosed contracts that survive Closing and bind Buyer without Buyer's knowledge.

### Asset-Type Variations
Same as Buyer Side analysis. The key variation is the volume and complexity of contracts, which is highest in multifamily and data center assets.

### Jurisdictional Notes
No significant variation.

---

## 8. Condemnation and Tax Appeals

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that no condemnation proceedings are pending against the Property or, to Seller's knowledge, have been threatened in writing. Separately, Seller discloses any pending tax certiorari proceedings on a schedule.

### Key Negotiation Points
- The "pending" prong can be a flat representation because pending condemnation is a matter of public record.
- The "threatened" prong should be limited to "threatened in writing" and qualified by knowledge. The UNICO forms use this formulation.
- Tax certiorari proceedings should be disclosed on a schedule with an agreed allocation of any refunds between Seller and Buyer.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
Minimal pushback expected. These are straightforward representations.

### Risk Assessment
Low risk if Seller accurately discloses pending and threatened proceedings. Condemnation is typically a matter of public record, and tax certiorari proceedings are filed with the tax assessment authority.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
Same as Buyer Side analysis regarding jurisdiction-specific tax appeal procedures.

---

## 9. FIRPTA / Tax Withholding

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that it is not a "foreign person" under Section 1445 of the Code and will deliver a FIRPTA certificate at Closing.

### Key Negotiation Points
Non-negotiable if true. If Seller IS a foreign person, address FIRPTA withholding through deal structuring (e.g., obtaining a withholding certificate from the IRS to reduce the 15% withholding, or structuring the disposition through a domestically controlled REIT).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
None -- this is a legal compliance requirement.

### Risk Assessment
None if the representation is accurate.

### Asset-Type Variations
None.

### Jurisdictional Notes
State-level withholding requirements for out-of-state sellers (California, Oregon, New York, etc.) should be addressed separately.

---

## 10. OFAC / Anti-Money Laundering

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that neither Seller nor, to Seller's actual knowledge, its affiliates, is in violation of OFAC sanctions or Anti-Money Laundering Laws. The representation should cover Seller and its affiliates, but NOT extend to all indirect investors or limited partners.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Apply "actual knowledge" (no duty to inquire) to the representation regarding affiliates. Seller should know its own status but may not have visibility into every indirect investor.
- Resist requests to extend the representation to all persons "controlling or controlled by" Seller. This is too broad for fund structures with numerous LPs. Limit to persons with 10%+ direct or indirect ownership.
- Include the standard formulation from the UNICO forms covering OFAC lists, Executive Orders, and the USA PATRIOT Act.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on a representation covering all direct and indirect owners.
- **Fallback**: Represent as to persons with 25%+ direct or indirect ownership (consistent with FinCEN's Beneficial Ownership Rule) and certify that Seller has AML/KYC procedures in place for all investors.

### Risk Assessment
Low risk if Seller has conducted appropriate OFAC screening. The cost of non-compliance is severe (criminal penalties, transaction voided), so this representation should be made carefully and accurately.

### Asset-Type Variations
None.

### Jurisdictional Notes
Federal law applies uniformly.

---

## 11. Bankruptcy / Solvency

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that it has not filed for, and is not the subject of, any voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, receivership, or similar proceeding. No solvency representation. No dissolution covenant beyond the survival period.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Resist the solvency representation**: Solvency representations are common in M&A but unusual in CRE. The SPE seller in a CRE transaction is often thinly capitalized (its only asset is the Property). A solvency representation is inherently problematic for an SPE that will distribute proceeds after Closing.
- **Resist the non-dissolution covenant**: Buyer will request that Seller not dissolve for 6-12 months after Closing. If possible, resist this entirely -- it interferes with Seller's (and its fund's) normal wind-down procedures. If pressed, agree to a limited non-dissolution covenant for the shorter of (a) the survival period and (b) 6 months, provided that Seller may dissolve earlier if it provides alternative security (holdback escrow or guaranty).
- **Alternatives to dissolution restrictions**: If Buyer is concerned about judgment collection, offer: (1) a holdback escrow funded at Closing (which eliminates the need for Seller to remain in existence); or (2) a guaranty from the fund or sponsor. These provide better protection for Buyer than a bare dissolution restriction.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on a solvency representation and a 12-month non-dissolution covenant.
- **Fallback**: Agree to a non-dissolution covenant for 9-12 months OR offer a holdback escrow. Do not agree to BOTH a lengthy non-dissolution covenant AND a holdback escrow -- that is duplicative and unnecessary.

### Risk Assessment
The bankruptcy representation itself carries minimal risk. The solvency and dissolution issues are about post-closing exposure, not the accuracy of the representation. Manage post-closing exposure through the liability cap, holdback, and survival limitations rather than entity-level restrictions.

### Asset-Type Variations
None.

### Jurisdictional Notes
Fraudulent transfer/conveyance laws may provide Buyer recourse if Seller distributes proceeds while known claims are pending, regardless of any dissolution covenant. This is a background legal protection that reduces the practical importance of the dissolution restriction.

---

## 12. No Options to Purchase / Superior Rights

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that no person has any right of first offer, ROFR, or option to purchase the Property arising through Seller, except as disclosed. This should be a flat representation (no knowledge qualifier) because Seller controls whether it grants these rights.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Disclose ALL existing ROFRs, ROFOs, and purchase options on a schedule, including any tenant purchase options in the Leases.
- If a ROFR or ROFO exists, Seller must either: (a) obtain a waiver from the rights holder before signing the PSA; or (b) condition the transaction on the rights holder declining to exercise. Address the timing and mechanics of the ROFR process in the PSA, including the effect on the Closing Date.
- Seller should provide that if a ROFR holder exercises its right, Seller may terminate the PSA and return the deposit, with no liability to Buyer.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
Minimal pushback on the representation itself. The negotiation focuses on the mechanics of handling existing ROFRs.

### Risk Assessment
An undisclosed purchase option or ROFR can constitute a breach of this representation and may also create a title defect. Seller's counsel should review all leases, REAs, and other agreements to identify any purchase rights before signing.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Retail**: Anchor tenant ROFRs are common.
- **Industrial**: Single-tenant net lease purchase options may exist at specified cap rates or fixed prices.

### Jurisdictional Notes
No significant variation.

---

## 13. Employees

### Preferred Position
Seller represents that it has no employees at the Property and that no employment agreements, union contracts, or similar obligations will survive Closing or create liability for Buyer. If Seller does have employees, terminate all employment relationships at Closing and provide an indemnity for pre-Closing employment liabilities.

### Key Negotiation Points
- If the property is managed by a third-party property manager, the employees are the property manager's employees, not Seller's. Terminate the management agreement at Closing and confirm that the property manager's employees have no claim against Buyer.
- If Seller does have employees (common in multifamily), disclose all employees, their compensation and benefits, and any pending employment claims. Terminate all employees at Closing. If Buyer wants to hire certain employees, facilitate introductions but do not make Buyer's hiring decision Seller's responsibility.
- WARN Act compliance: If terminating a large number of employees, ensure compliance with the federal WARN Act (60 days' notice for plant closings or mass layoffs of 100+ employees) and state mini-WARN acts. Factor WARN compliance timing into the closing schedule.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists that Seller retain liability for all pre-Closing employment claims, including discrimination, harassment, and wage-and-hour claims.
- **Fallback**: Accept an indemnity for pre-Closing employment claims, limited by the general liability cap and survival period. Do not accept an uncapped employment indemnity.

### Risk Assessment
Employment liability is most significant in multifamily and hospitality-adjacent properties. The UNICO Buyer Side form correctly addresses this with a comprehensive representation. Seller should mirror this representation and back it up with an indemnity limited to the cap.

### Asset-Type Variations
Same as Buyer Side analysis. Multifamily is the highest-risk asset class.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York City**: Displaced Building Service Workers Protection Act requires successors to retain building service employees for 90 days. This is Buyer's obligation post-Closing, not Seller's, but disclose the applicability.
- **California**: Cal-WARN Act, FEHA, and extensive wage-and-hour requirements create significant exposure.

---

## 14. Financial Statements and No Fraudulent Concealment

### Preferred Position
Seller delivers financial statements (operating statements, budgets) as part of due diligence materials but does NOT represent their accuracy. The as-is clause covers the financial information. If a representation is required, limit it to: "To Seller's knowledge, Seller has not knowingly or intentionally withheld or concealed any documents or information that would make the Due Diligence Materials materially untrue or misleading."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Do not warrant accuracy of financials**: Seller's operating statements are unaudited and based on the property manager's records. Warranting their accuracy creates liability for errors made by the property manager, accountant, or bookkeeper. Buyer should rely on its own underwriting and due diligence review of the financials.
- **"No fraudulent concealment" is the maximum**: The UNICO Buyer Side form includes this provision (Section 5.1.19), which is the most Seller should agree to. It protects Buyer against intentional fraud while avoiding liability for innocent errors.
- **Qualify with knowledge**: Even the no-fraudulent-concealment provision should be qualified by knowledge ("Seller has not KNOWINGLY or INTENTIONALLY withheld..."). This limits the representation to intentional misconduct, not negligent omissions.
- **Resist any representation regarding "material undisclosed liabilities"**: This is an M&A-style representation that has no place in a CRE transaction. Buyer should discover liabilities through its own due diligence.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on a representation that the financial statements are "true, correct and complete in all material respects."
- **Fallback**: Accept "the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Seller's standard accounting practices and are based on the books and records maintained by Seller's property manager." This provides some assurance of consistency without warranting accuracy. Add "Seller makes no representation regarding the accuracy of projections, budgets, or forward-looking financial information."

### Risk Assessment
Financial statement representations expose Seller to claims of misrepresentation if any line item is inaccurate, even if the inaccuracy is unintentional and immaterial. The no-fraudulent-concealment formulation properly allocates this risk: Seller is liable for intentional fraud but not for unintentional errors.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation. Apply the same approach across all asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
No significant variation.

---

## PART TWO: BUYER REPRESENTATIONS -- SCOPE AND EXPANSION

---

## 15. Buyer's Organization, Authority, and Non-Contravention

### Preferred Position
Buyer represents that it is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing, with full power and authority to execute, deliver, and perform the Agreement. The execution does not violate any law, judgment, or order, or constitute a default under any agreement. Buyer has not filed for or been the subject of any bankruptcy proceeding.

### Key Negotiation Points
- Require these representations as a mirror of Seller's corresponding representations. They are standard and expected.
- If Buyer is a newly formed SPE, the authority representation should confirm that any investment committee or internal approvals required have been (or will be) obtained. The UNICO Buyer Side form addresses this with the "Buyer Approval Notice" mechanism.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
Minimal pushback expected. These are standard representations.

### Risk Assessment
These representations protect Seller against a Buyer that lacks authority to close, which could leave Seller stranded at the closing table. Title companies also rely on these representations.

### Asset-Type Variations
None.

### Jurisdictional Notes
None.

---

## 16. Buyer's OFAC / AML Compliance

### Preferred Position
Buyer represents that neither Buyer nor its affiliates or direct sources of funding is in violation of OFAC sanctions or AML Laws, and that the funds used for the acquisition are derived from lawful sources. Extend the representation to Buyer's direct sources of funding (not just Buyer itself).

### Key Negotiation Points
- The Meadows form includes a thorough formulation extending the OFAC/AML representation to Buyer's "direct sources of funding." This is important because Seller needs assurance that it is not receiving the proceeds of money laundering or terrorist financing.
- Require Buyer to represent that it "has taken such measures as are required of Buyer under AML Laws to ascertain that the funds being invested by Buyer in the Property under this Agreement are derived from permissible sources." This shifts the AML compliance burden to Buyer.
- Require Buyer to represent compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer argues it cannot represent as to all sources of funding, particularly in fund structures.
- **Fallback**: Accept the representation as to Buyer and its direct (not indirect) sources of funding, with a representation that Buyer has AML/KYC procedures in place.

### Risk Assessment
Receiving the proceeds of money laundering or transacting with a sanctioned person exposes Seller to criminal liability. This representation is not a negotiable business point -- it is a legal compliance requirement.

### Asset-Type Variations
None.

### Jurisdictional Notes
Federal law applies uniformly.

---

## 17. Buyer's ERISA Status

### Preferred Position
Buyer represents that it is NOT acting on behalf of an "employee benefit plan" subject to ERISA or an entity whose assets constitute "plan assets." If Buyer IS a plan or plan asset entity, Buyer must identify the applicable ERISA exemption.

### Key Negotiation Points
- The detailed seller-side PSA form includes a comprehensive ERISA representation from Buyer, covering plans subject to Title I of ERISA, plans subject to Section 4975 of the Code, plan asset entities, and governmental plans.
- If Buyer is a plan asset entity, require it to identify the ERISA exemption being relied upon and provide an opinion of ERISA counsel if requested.
- If Seller's lender or any party to the transaction is a "party in interest" with respect to Buyer's plan, the transaction could be a prohibited transaction. The ERISA representation shifts this risk to Buyer.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
Buyer should accept this representation if it can accurately make it. If Buyer IS a plan asset entity, the parties need to structure the transaction to comply with ERISA, which requires ERISA counsel involvement.

### Risk Assessment
ERISA prohibited transaction liability includes excise taxes of 15% per year on the amount involved, plus potential personal liability for fiduciaries. This is a significant risk that justifies requiring the representation.

### Asset-Type Variations
None.

### Jurisdictional Notes
ERISA is a federal statute that preempts state law.

## 18. Buyer's Sophistication and Experience

### Preferred Position
Buyer represents that it is experienced in the acquisition and ownership of commercial real estate similar to the Property, that it recognizes the risks of acquiring and owning the Property, and that the allocation of risk in the Agreement is intended and understood.

### Key Negotiation Points
- This representation supports the enforceability of the as-is clause and the release of claims. Courts are more likely to enforce as-is clauses against sophisticated, experienced buyers.
- The Meadows form includes this representation: "Buyer represents to Seller that it is experienced in the acquisition of real property similar to the Real Property and that Buyer recognizes the risks of acquiring and owning the Property and that an allocation of risk is intended by this Agreement."
- Require Buyer to acknowledge that it has been represented by counsel and has had the opportunity to conduct its own due diligence.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
In institutional transactions ($50M+), this representation should be uncontroversial. Institutional buyers are sophisticated by definition.

### Risk Assessment
This representation is a prophylactic measure that supports the enforceability of the as-is clause and liability limitations. It reduces the risk that a court will void the as-is clause on the ground that the buyer did not understand the risks.

### Asset-Type Variations
None.

### Jurisdictional Notes
Some jurisdictions (particularly California) apply consumer protection principles more aggressively. A sophistication representation helps rebut any argument that the buyer was an unsophisticated consumer deserving of additional protection.

## PART THREE: CRITICAL MECHANICAL ISSUES -- SELLER'S PERSPECTIVE

---

## 19. Knowledge Qualifiers

### Preferred Position
"To Seller's knowledge" means the current actual knowledge of a single, named individual (the Designated Seller Representative or asset manager), without any duty of independent investigation or inquiry, and without imputation of knowledge from any other person, agent, property manager, or entity.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Name a single individual**: The ideal knowledge individual from Seller's perspective is the asset manager assigned to the Property -- senior enough to have general awareness, but not so close to operations that every operational detail is "known."
- **No duty to inquire**: Essential. "Without duty of inquiry or imputation of knowledge" is the standard formulation in the UNICO Seller Side form and the detailed seller-side PSA form. This prevents Buyer from arguing that the knowledge individual "should have known" something.
- **No imputation**: Knowledge of the property manager, on-site staff, or other agents should NOT be imputed to Seller. The detailed seller-side PSA form expressly provides: "Purchaser acknowledges that the Designated Seller Representative is named solely for the purpose of defining the scope of Seller's knowledge and not for the purpose of imposing any liability on or creating any duties running from the Designated Seller Representative."
- **No personal liability**: The knowledge individual has no personal liability. "Each named individual is acting for and on behalf of Seller and is in no manner expressly or impliedly making any representations or warranties in an individual capacity." Both UNICO forms include this.
- **Exclude pre-acquisition knowledge**: If Seller acquired the Property relatively recently, the knowledge individual may not have been involved in the property's prior operations. The Meadows form addresses this: "[The knowledge individual] was not involved in the operation of the Property before Seller's acquisition of the Property" and "is not charged with knowledge of any of the acts or omissions of predecessors in title."
- **"Deemed knowledge" is not actual knowledge**: The Meadows form adds a further protection: "Actual knowledge shall not be deemed to exist merely by assertion by Buyer of a claim that any of the foregoing persons should have known of such facts or circumstances, if such person did not have actual knowledge."
- **Fallback if Buyer pushes for multiple individuals**: If Buyer insists on more than one knowledge individual, agree to add a second individual (e.g., the property manager's designated contact), but maintain the "without duty of inquiry" standard and the no-personal-liability protection for all named individuals.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on a "duty to inquire" or "constructive knowledge" standard.
- **Fallback**: Reject both. Offer a compromise: name a second, more operationally involved individual (e.g., the senior property manager for the asset), which gives Buyer a broader knowledge base without imposing an affirmative duty to investigate. The practical effect is similar to a duty to inquire (the property manager is likely aware of operational issues) without the legal exposure of a formal duty.
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on naming the property management company as a knowledge party.
- **Fallback**: Name the specific individual at the property management company (not the company itself), and make clear that this individual is acting solely on behalf of Seller with no personal liability.

### Risk Assessment
The knowledge qualifier is Seller's primary tool for limiting the scope of representations. A narrow knowledge standard (single individual, actual knowledge, no duty to inquire) dramatically reduces Seller's exposure. A broad knowledge standard (multiple individuals, constructive knowledge, duty to inquire) significantly increases it. Negotiate this aggressively.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily**: The on-site property manager has the most granular knowledge. Buyer will push hard to include this person. Seller should resist unless market conditions require it, and if included, limit to the regional or senior property manager (not the on-site manager).
- **Office**: The building engineer may have knowledge of systems issues. Include the asset manager only.
- **Industrial**: For single-tenant net leases, the asset manager may be the only person with any knowledge of the property.

### Jurisdictional Notes
Knowledge standards are contractual and enforced as drafted. No significant jurisdictional variation in interpretation.

---

## 20. Materiality Qualifiers

### Preferred Position
All of Seller's representations should be qualified by "in all material respects" at the outset. The UNICO Seller Side form uses this approach: "Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser, as of the Effective Date and as of Closing, that the following matters are true, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Blanket materiality qualifier**: The most protective approach is a blanket materiality qualifier that applies to ALL representations at the introductory level, as in the UNICO Seller Side form. This means that no individual representation is breached unless the inaccuracy is "material."
- **Double materiality**: When the bring-down condition also requires that representations remain true "in all material respects," the combined effect creates a "double materiality" standard -- both the representation itself and the bring-down are materiality-qualified. This provides maximum protection for Seller.
- **Resist defined thresholds**: Buyer may push to replace "material" with defined dollar thresholds. Resist this. Undefined "materiality" gives Seller more flexibility and creates ambiguity that benefits Seller (because Buyer bears the burden of proving a breach is "material").
- **No MAE definition**: If Buyer proposes a "Material Adverse Effect" definition, resist. An undefined "material" standard is more protective for Seller than a defined MAE, because the defined MAE typically includes specific exclusions (market conditions, changes in law) that limit its scope but also clarify what DOES constitute an MAE.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer argues that the blanket materiality qualifier renders the representations meaningless.
- **Fallback**: Agree to remove the blanket qualifier if individual representations contain their own materiality qualifiers where appropriate. This gives the appearance of specificity while maintaining materiality protection.
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on defined dollar thresholds.
- **Fallback**: If defined thresholds are required, set them at levels that exclude all but the most significant issues. For a $100M deal: $100,000 per item for litigation, violations, and contracts; $250,000 in the aggregate for lease-related matters.

### Risk Assessment
The materiality qualifier is Seller's second most important limitation (after the knowledge qualifier). Without it, any technical inaccuracy -- no matter how trivial -- constitutes a breach. With it, only significant inaccuracies give rise to a claim.

### Asset-Type Variations
Calibrate materiality thresholds (if defined) to the property's value and typical operating expense profile.

### Jurisdictional Notes
No significant variation. Courts in all jurisdictions apply contractual materiality qualifiers as drafted.

---

## 21. Survival Period and Limitations

### Preferred Position
All representations and warranties survive Closing for 6 months, at which time they terminate automatically. Any cause of action not then in litigation (including indemnification claims) shall terminate. The UNICO Seller Side form uses a 6-month survival period with an express termination provision.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **6-month survival is the target**: The detailed seller-side PSA form also uses 6 months. This is Seller's strongest position but is achievable in competitive markets.
- **Survival period fallback chain**:
  1. **Best position**: 6 months.
  2. **First fallback**: 9 months.
  3. **Second fallback**: 12 months (the UNICO Buyer Side standard).
  4. **Last resort**: 18 months. Anything beyond 18 months is unusual in institutional CRE and should be resisted vigorously.
- **Environmental representation survival**: If Buyer pushes for a longer survival period for environmental representations, Seller should: (1) resist any differentiation -- all representations should have the same survival period; (2) if differentiation is unavoidable, limit the extended environmental survival to matters NOT disclosed in environmental reports; and (3) cap the extended-period liability at a fraction of the general liability cap.
- **Automatic termination**: The survival clause should provide that representations "and any cause of action resulting from a breach thereof not then in litigation, including indemnification claims, shall terminate." This means Buyer must file a lawsuit (not just send a demand letter) before the survival period expires to preserve its claim.
- **Require litigation, not just notice**: The UNICO forms require that a cause of action be "in litigation" to survive the survival period. This is more protective than a "notice" standard (where merely sending a letter would preserve the claim). Push for the "in litigation" standard.
- **Insurance-first requirement**: The detailed seller-side PSA form requires that "Purchaser agrees to first seek recovery under any insurance policies, Leases and Contracts prior to seeking recovery from Seller." This is a powerful protection -- it forces Buyer to exhaust other sources of recovery before coming to Seller. If Buyer pushes back, offer a tolling of the survival period during the insurance claim process as a compromise.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on 18-24 months.
- **Fallback**: Offer 12 months, which is the UNICO Buyer Side standard and represents a reasonable market position. Compensate for the shorter survival by offering a slightly higher liability cap (e.g., 3% instead of 2.5%) or a more efficient claims process.
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists that sending a written notice (not filing litigation) should preserve a claim.
- **Fallback**: Accept a 30-day "grace period" after the survival period expires during which Buyer must file litigation for any previously noticed claim. The Meadows form uses this approach: claims must be "commenced" within 30 days after the survival period. This is a reasonable compromise.

### Risk Assessment
The survival period directly determines Seller's post-closing exposure window. A 6-month survival period means Seller can dissolve the SPE, distribute proceeds, and close its books 6 months after Closing (assuming no pending claims). Every additional month of survival extends the period during which Seller must maintain the entity and reserves.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation by asset type. The survival period is primarily a deal-level negotiation point.

### Jurisdictional Notes
Contractual shortening of limitation periods is generally enforceable in all US jurisdictions, subject to unconscionability limitations.

---

## 22. Bring-Down at Closing

### Preferred Position
Seller's representations are deemed reaffirmed at Closing unless Seller has given notice of a changed condition. The Closing Certificate certifies that representations are true "in all material respects" with exceptions for (a) changes that are not materially adverse and (b) changes in the lease and contract schedules.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Deemed reaffirmation**: The UNICO Seller Side form uses a "deemed reaffirmation" approach: "Unless Seller gives notice to Purchaser...the foregoing representations and warranties shall be deemed to be reaffirmed at Closing." This puts the onus on Seller to notify if something has changed, but the reaffirmation is automatic if Seller is silent.
- **Broad exceptions in the Closing Certificate**: The Meadows form (Exhibit F) provides that the Closing Certificate certifies representations are true "except for (a) any changes that are not materially adverse and (b) any changes in the list of Leases...or Contracts." This effectively carves out ALL changes in leases and contracts from the bring-down, which is extremely protective.
- **Seller's right to postpone Closing to cure**: The Meadows form allows Seller to postpone Closing for up to 7 days if a representation cannot be truthfully brought down. This gives Seller a cure opportunity rather than being in immediate breach.
- **Double materiality at bring-down**: Ensure that both the representations (qualified by "material") and the bring-down condition (qualified by "material") contain materiality qualifiers. This creates the double materiality standard discussed above.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on a clean Closing Certificate with no exceptions.
- **Fallback**: The Closing Certificate should reflect reality. If a condition has changed (e.g., a new lease has been signed, a contract has been modified), the certificate should disclose the change. This is a matter of accuracy, not negotiation. The key protections are: (1) the materiality qualifier prevents immaterial changes from blocking closing; and (2) the update/bring-down mechanism (discussed below) determines the consequences of material changes.

### Risk Assessment
The bring-down certificate is a potential trap for Seller if the knowledge individual cannot truthfully certify that all representations remain true. Seller should ensure that the bring-down standard is "in all material respects" and that the certificate form includes appropriate exceptions.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
No significant variation.

---

## 23. Update Rights and Obligations

### Preferred Position
Seller has the RIGHT (but not the obligation) to update disclosure schedules between signing and closing. If Seller provides an update notice, Buyer may: (a) terminate the Agreement and receive the deposit; or (b) proceed to Closing and WAIVE all claims based on the updated matter. If Buyer proceeds to Closing after receiving an update, Seller has NO liability for the updated matter.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Right, not obligation**: Seller should have the right (not the obligation) to update. If it is an obligation, Seller's failure to update could itself be a breach.
- **Waiver upon closing**: The critical protection is that if Buyer receives an update and proceeds to Closing, Buyer is DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED the updated condition and has waived all claims. The UNICO Seller Side form provides: "If Purchaser does not elect to terminate...Purchaser shall proceed with the Closing...with knowledge and acceptance of the Material Changed Condition, and Seller shall have no liability as a result thereof."
- **Buyer's sole remedy is termination**: The update mechanism should provide that Buyer's SOLE remedy for an updated condition is termination. If Buyer does not terminate, it has waived. Seller should NOT be liable in damages for updated conditions.
- **Compressed decision period**: Give Buyer a short decision period (5 business days) to decide whether to terminate. This prevents Buyer from using the update as leverage to renegotiate the price.
- **"Material Changed Condition" formulation**: The UNICO Seller Side form uses the concept of a "Material Changed Condition" -- only material changes trigger the update mechanism. Immaterial changes are covered by the materiality qualifier and do not require notice.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on preserving damages remedies even if Buyer proceeds to Closing after an update, particularly for seller-caused changes.
- **Fallback**: Accept a distinction between seller-caused and third-party-caused updates. For updates caused by Seller's breach (e.g., Seller entered into a lease without Buyer's consent), Buyer retains damages remedies. For updates caused by events outside Seller's control (e.g., a new tenant default, a new lawsuit filed by a third party), Buyer's sole remedy is termination. The UNICO Buyer Side form uses this approach.
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on a longer decision period (10 business days).
- **Fallback**: Accept 5-7 business days. Avoid 10+ business days because this creates significant closing uncertainty.

### Risk Assessment
The update mechanism is Seller's key tool for managing the gap between signing and closing. Without it, any change in condition during the pendency period could constitute a breach, even if the change is outside Seller's control. With the update/waiver mechanism, Seller can notify Buyer of changes and force a decision: close or terminate.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
No significant variation.

## 24. Anti-Sandbagging

### Preferred Position
Express anti-sandbagging provision: If Buyer closes with knowledge that a representation is untrue, Buyer waives all claims based on that representation. "Knowledge" includes: (a) actual knowledge of Buyer's designated individuals; and (b) knowledge deemed to include all matters disclosed in the due diligence materials, title commitment, and disclosure schedules.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Express provision, not silence**: In pro-sandbagging jurisdictions (New York, Delaware), silence defaults to allowing the buyer to assert post-closing claims regardless of knowledge. Seller MUST include an express anti-sandbagging clause to overcome the default rule.
- **The "automatic deemed modification" approach**: The most protective formulation is from the detailed seller-side PSA form (Section 7.4(a)): "All of Seller's representations and warranties shall automatically be deemed modified to reflect Purchaser's Knowledge as of the end of the Study Period." This is the gold standard for seller protection -- it automatically adjusts the representations to match what Buyer actually knew (or is deemed to have known).
- **Expansive definition of "Purchaser's Knowledge"**: The detailed seller-side PSA form defines Purchaser's Knowledge to include: "(a) all matters and information disclosed in this Agreement (including in any exhibit or schedule); (b) any matters and information disclosed in any of the Documents received by or made available to Purchaser or its agents, attorneys or representatives before the Closing; and (c) any other matter or information disclosed in writing to Purchaser." This means that everything in the data room is "known" by Buyer, regardless of whether Buyer actually reviewed it.
- **Minimum claim threshold**: Pair the anti-sandbagging clause with a minimum claim threshold (the basket): Buyer waives claims where damages are less than a stated amount. The seller income property form and the UNICO Seller Side form include a $50,000 minimum: Buyer waives claims "if Buyer's damages as a result of such representations or warranties being untrue, inaccurate or incorrect are, in the aggregate, less than $50,000."
- **Fallback positions**:
  1. **Best position**: Automatic deemed modification based on Purchaser's Knowledge (including data room materials).
  2. **First fallback**: Anti-sandbagging clause based on Buyer's "actual knowledge" (subjective, but includes knowledge gained from reviewing due diligence materials).
  3. **Second fallback**: Anti-sandbagging clause based on knowledge of matters "expressly disclosed" in the due diligence materials or on the disclosure schedules.
  4. **Third fallback**: Anti-sandbagging clause based on Buyer's actual knowledge, with "actual knowledge" defined to include knowledge of specifically named Buyer individuals only.
  5. **Last resort**: Agreement is silent (unfavorable in pro-sandbagging jurisdictions).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists that representations are a contractual allocation of risk and should not be affected by Buyer's knowledge (citing CBS v. Ziff-Davis).
- **Fallback**: Argue that the equitable principle underlying the anti-sandbagging clause is that a buyer who closes with full knowledge that a representation is untrue has not been harmed -- it received exactly what it expected. Offer a compromise: anti-sandbagging applies to matters EXPRESSLY DISCLOSED on the schedules or in written notices from Seller, but does not apply to matters that Buyer may have independently discovered in the data room. This limits the "deemed knowledge" to Seller's express disclosures.
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists that the anti-sandbagging clause not apply to fraud or intentional misrepresentation.
- **Fallback**: Accept a fraud carve-out. The anti-sandbagging clause protects against innocent changes in condition, not intentional deception. If Seller intentionally lied in a representation, the anti-sandbagging clause should not protect it.

### Risk Assessment
In pro-sandbagging jurisdictions, the absence of an express anti-sandbagging clause means Buyer can close with full knowledge that a representation is untrue and still pursue a post-closing claim. This is Seller's greatest post-closing risk. Always include an express anti-sandbagging clause.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation by asset type. The issue is purely contractual.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: Pro-sandbagging under CBS v. Ziff-Davis. An express anti-sandbagging clause is ESSENTIAL.
- **Delaware**: Pro-sandbagging under recent case law. Express clause essential.
- **California**: Less clearly pro-sandbagging; some courts apply reliance principles. An express anti-sandbagging clause provides certainty.
- **Texas**: Mixed authority. Express clause recommended.

---

## 25. Liability Cap

### Preferred Position
Seller's aggregate liability for breach of all representations shall not exceed 1% of the Purchase Price. The detailed seller-side PSA form uses a 1% "Claim Cap."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Cap fallback chain**:
  1. **Best position**: 1% of Purchase Price (the detailed seller-side PSA form standard).
  2. **First fallback**: 1.5% of Purchase Price.
  3. **Second fallback**: 2.5% of Purchase Price (the UNICO Seller Side standard).
  4. **Third fallback**: 3% of Purchase Price.
  5. **Last resort**: 5% of Purchase Price. Anything above 5% is unusual and should be rejected.
- **Cap applies to ALL claims**: Ensure the cap applies to "all breaches and any matters relating thereto or under any law applicable to the Property or this transaction...in the aggregate." The detailed seller-side PSA form uses this comprehensive formulation.
- **No fraud carve-out (Seller's strongest position)**: Resist any carve-out from the cap for fraud or intentional misrepresentation. If Buyer insists, Seller's fallback is to accept a fraud carve-out but limit it to "actual fraud" (not constructive fraud or negligent misrepresentation) and require that the fraud claim be proven by clear and convincing evidence.
- **Non-assignable**: The cap (and the representations generally) should be "personal to Seller and Purchaser and may not be assigned to or enforced by any other Person." The detailed seller-side PSA form includes this provision. This prevents Buyer from selling the property and assigning the right to assert representation claims to the subsequent buyer.
- **Excludes consequential damages**: Seller is liable for "direct, but not consequential, incidental, indirect, punitive, special or exemplary, damages or lost profits." The detailed seller-side PSA form expressly excludes these categories.
- **Holdback escrow in lieu of higher cap**: If Buyer pushes for a higher cap, offer a holdback escrow at the lower cap amount as an alternative. A $1M escrow is more meaningful to Buyer than a $5M cap against an SPE that may be judgment-proof.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on a 5% cap, citing the UNICO Buyer Side form.
- **Fallback**: Counter with 2.5% (the UNICO Seller Side standard), which represents a fair market position. Offer a holdback escrow or guaranty to backstop the cap if Buyer is concerned about collectibility.
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on a fraud carve-out from the cap.
- **Fallback**: Accept a fraud carve-out limited to "intentional fraud" (not negligent misrepresentation or constructive fraud), with a requirement that the fraud be proven by clear and convincing evidence, and with a separate, higher cap for fraud claims (e.g., 5% of Purchase Price).

### Risk Assessment
The liability cap is the ultimate backstop limiting Seller's exposure. Combined with the survival period, knowledge qualifiers, materiality qualifiers, and anti-sandbagging clause, the cap defines the maximum financial risk of the representations. Negotiate the cap as part of a comprehensive package, not in isolation.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation by asset type. The cap is calibrated to the Purchase Price, which already reflects asset-type differences.

### Jurisdictional Notes
Caps are generally enforceable in all US jurisdictions. Some courts may refuse to enforce a cap that is so low as to be unconscionable, but in institutional CRE transactions between sophisticated parties, even a 1% cap is typically enforceable.

---

## 26. Basket / Deductible

### Preferred Position
A true deductible: Seller is only liable for claims in excess of the threshold amount, with the threshold set at $100,000 (or 0.1% of Purchase Price). Claims below the threshold are not actionable.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **True deductible, not tipping basket**: A true deductible (Seller pays only amounts ABOVE the threshold) is more protective than a tipping basket (Seller pays from dollar one once the threshold is exceeded). Push for the true deductible.
- **Per-claim mini-basket**: In addition to the aggregate basket, include a per-claim mini-basket (e.g., $10,000-$25,000). Individual claims below the mini-basket do not count toward the aggregate basket. This prevents aggregation of trivial claims to reach the threshold.
- **Deductible amount fallback chain**:
  1. **Best position**: True deductible at $250,000 (or 0.25% of Purchase Price).
  2. **First fallback**: True deductible at $100,000 (the detailed seller-side PSA form and Meadows form standard).
  3. **Second fallback**: Tipping basket at $100,000.
  4. **Third fallback**: Tipping basket at $50,000 (the UNICO Seller Side standard).
  5. **Last resort**: Tipping basket at $25,000 (the UNICO Buyer Side standard).
- **Interaction with the cap**: The deductible raises the floor of Seller's liability, and the cap lowers the ceiling. Together, they define the "window" of Seller's exposure. For a $100M deal with a $100,000 deductible and a $2.5M cap, Seller's exposure window is $100,000 to $2.5M.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on no basket or a tipping basket.
- **Fallback**: Accept a tipping basket at a reasonable threshold. The key concession is moving from a true deductible (Seller pays only the excess) to a tipping basket (Seller pays from dollar one once the threshold is exceeded). The dollar threshold is the secondary negotiation point.

### Risk Assessment
The deductible/basket is a cost-of-doing-business allocation. Small claims should be Buyer's responsibility. The deductible prevents Buyer from using the representation provisions as an after-the-fact price adjustment for minor issues.

### Asset-Type Variations
Calibrate the threshold to the property's operating scale.

### Jurisdictional Notes
Deductibles and baskets are contractual provisions enforced as written in all US jurisdictions.

---

## 27. Interaction with As-Is Clause

### Preferred Position
The as-is clause is the primary protection for Seller regarding the condition of the Property. The representations are a narrow exception to the as-is clause, and the as-is clause should be drafted to maximize its protective effect while preserving the carve-out for surviving representations.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Comprehensive as-is clause**: Include a detailed, enumerated disclaimer of warranties covering: value, income, suitability, habitability, merchantability, fitness for purpose, condition, compliance with laws, environmental condition, accuracy of financial information, zoning, construction quality, and every other conceivable matter. The Meadows form and the seller income property form include exhaustive as-is provisions with 12-18 enumerated categories of disclaimed warranties.
- **Release of claims**: In addition to the as-is disclaimer, include a release of claims by Buyer against Seller and all Seller Parties. The release should cover structural, physical, environmental, and all other conditions of the Property. The Meadows form includes both an as-is clause and a separate release.
- **California Section 1542 waiver**: In California transactions, include a waiver of Civil Code Section 1542 (which preserves claims the releasing party does not know about). The Meadows form includes a general waiver of similar state laws.
- **Initialed/separately signed**: Many forms require the as-is clause and release to be separately initialed by both parties. This provides additional evidence of informed consent.
- **Carve-out for surviving representations**: The as-is clause MUST carve out Seller's express representations and warranties that survive Closing. Without this carve-out, the as-is clause could be interpreted to override the representations entirely, which would create internal inconsistency. Draft the carve-out narrowly: "EXCEPT FOR SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION [5.1] OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT EXPRESSLY SURVIVE THE CLOSING PURSUANT TO SECTION [5.4]."
- **No duty of disclosure**: The Meadows form goes further: "Neither Seller nor any Seller Party is under any duty...to make any affirmative disclosures or inquiry regarding any matter relating to the Property that may or may not be known to Seller or any Seller Party." This is an extraordinary protection that effectively disclaims any duty of disclosure beyond the express representations.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer argues that the as-is clause is too broad and effectively eliminates all representations.
- **Fallback**: The carve-out for surviving representations addresses this concern. The as-is clause applies to all matters NOT covered by the surviving representations. The representations apply to specific, identified matters. The two provisions work together, not in conflict.

### Risk Assessment
The as-is clause is Seller's most powerful protection. If properly drafted and supported by a release, it bars Buyer from asserting post-closing claims based on the condition of the Property, environmental contamination, physical defects, or any other matter that Buyer could have discovered through due diligence. The only post-closing claims available to Buyer are for breach of the surviving representations (subject to the cap, basket, and survival limitations).

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation. The as-is clause is universal in institutional CRE.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Texas**: Courts enforce as-is clauses aggressively, even against claims that might be characterized as fraud in other jurisdictions. Seller-friendly jurisdiction for as-is enforcement.
- **New York**: Courts enforce as-is clauses between sophisticated parties but recognize exceptions for active concealment and fraud.
- **California**: Courts enforce as-is clauses but are more willing to find exceptions for fraud, concealment, or failure to disclose known material defects.

---

## 28. Schedule Disclosure Mechanics

### Preferred Position
Disclosure on any schedule constitutes disclosure for all purposes under the Agreement. Matters disclosed in the due diligence materials are deemed disclosed for all representations. The introductory qualifier of the representations incorporates the due diligence materials as a deemed disclosure.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Cross-disclosure**: Push for a blanket cross-disclosure provision: "Disclosure of any matter on any schedule or in any document delivered or made available to Buyer shall be deemed disclosure for all purposes under this Agreement, regardless of whether such disclosure is specifically referenced on a particular schedule." This maximizes the protective effect of disclosures.
- **Due diligence materials as deemed disclosure**: The UNICO Seller Side form qualifies all representations as "except as may otherwise be disclosed in the Title Commitment, the Due Diligence Materials or in Exhibit N attached hereto." This means that anything in the data room is a deemed disclosure that qualifies every representation. This is extremely protective for Seller.
- **Buyer's due diligence modifications**: The seller income property form includes a provision that "to the extent the Due Diligence Materials furnished or made available to or otherwise obtained by Buyer prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period contains express provisions or information that are inconsistent with the foregoing representations and warranties, such representations and warranties shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to eliminate such inconsistency." This is the maximum protection -- the representations are automatically modified by the due diligence materials.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer argues that blanket incorporation of due diligence materials as disclosures overwhelms the specificity of the representations with volume.
- **Fallback**: Accept that specific schedules must be provided for key representations (leases, contracts, litigation), but maintain the blanket deemed-disclosure provision for the due diligence materials generally. Specific schedules address the most important representations; the blanket provision is a safety net for everything else.

### Risk Assessment
The schedule disclosure mechanics determine what Seller must specifically identify versus what is deemed already disclosed. Broader deemed-disclosure provisions protect Seller against claims that a matter was not "specifically" disclosed on a particular schedule.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
No significant variation.

---

## 29. Post-Closing Security / Holdback

### Preferred Position
No holdback escrow, no guaranty, no letter of credit. Buyer's recourse is limited to the Seller entity (the SPE), which may distribute proceeds after Closing, subject only to a limited non-dissolution covenant.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Resist all forms of post-closing security**: Seller's default position should be that no holdback is required. The liability cap, basket, survival period, knowledge qualifiers, and anti-sandbagging provisions collectively limit Seller's exposure to a manageable level. Post-closing security is an additional cost and burden.
- **If holdback is required** (because market conditions demand it):
  1. **Amount**: The holdback should be as small as possible -- typically 50% or less of the liability cap. For a $100M deal with a 2.5% cap ($2.5M), a $1M holdback is reasonable.
  2. **Release timing**: The holdback should be released automatically at the expiration of the survival period, less any amounts subject to pending claims. Consider a partial release at the midpoint of the survival period (e.g., 50% released at 6 months, remainder released at 12 months).
  3. **Escrow agent**: Use Seller's title company (not Buyer's) as escrow agent, or a neutral title company.
  4. **Investment of escrowed funds**: The escrowed funds should be invested in short-term, liquid instruments (money market account), with interest accruing for Seller's benefit.
  5. **Disbursement mechanics**: The escrow agreement should require mutual instructions for disbursement or a court order. Avoid giving Buyer unilateral draw rights.
- **Guaranty as alternative to holdback**: If Buyer insists on recourse beyond the SPE, a guaranty from the fund or sponsor entity is preferable to a cash holdback because it does not tie up Seller's cash. However, Seller should limit the guaranty to the liability cap amount and the survival period, with automatic termination at the end of the survival period.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on a holdback equal to the full liability cap.
- **Fallback**: Offer a holdback at 50-75% of the cap, with the remainder backstopped by a non-dissolution covenant for the survival period. Or offer a guaranty from a creditworthy parent in lieu of any cash holdback.
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on a guaranty that survives for 6 months beyond the survival period (to cover claims asserted near the end of the survival period).
- **Fallback**: Accept a 3-month tail on the guaranty (total of survival period plus 3 months), which gives Buyer time to formalize a claim asserted near the survival deadline.

### Risk Assessment
Post-closing security is a cost to Seller (either in cash locked up in escrow or in the commitment of a guarantor). Minimize it through aggressive negotiation of the underlying limitations (cap, basket, survival, anti-sandbagging) so that the risk profile does not justify significant security.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
Escrow agreements are governed by the law of the escrow agent's jurisdiction or the governing law specified in the escrow agreement.

## 30. Remedy for Breach

### Preferred Position
**Pre-Closing**: Buyer's sole remedy for a breach discovered before Closing is to terminate the Agreement and receive the deposit back. No damages. No specific performance for cure of representations.

**Post-Closing**: Buyer's sole remedy is a claim for direct damages, subject to the liability cap, basket, survival period, and all other limitations. No consequential, incidental, indirect, punitive, special, or exemplary damages. No lost profits.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Pre-Closing sole remedy is termination**: The UNICO Seller Side form provides that Buyer's sole remedy for an updated condition is termination with deposit return. No damages, no expense reimbursement, no specific performance.
- **No reimbursement of expenses**: Resist Buyer's request for reimbursement of due diligence costs, legal fees, and other out-of-pocket expenses upon termination. The deposit return should be the complete remedy.
- **Post-Closing damages are direct only**: Exclude all consequential, incidental, indirect, punitive, special, and exemplary damages, and lost profits. The detailed seller-side PSA form includes this exclusion.
- **Cure period before claim is actionable**: The Meadows form gives Seller a 15-day cure period after receiving notice of a post-closing claim. This is a valuable protection -- it gives Seller the opportunity to remediate the issue before damages accrue.
- **Sole and exclusive remedy clause**: Include a comprehensive "sole and exclusive remedy" provision: "Following the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and Purchaser under, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Property and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether based in contract, tort, strict liability, statute, common law or otherwise, shall be as set forth in this Section." The detailed seller-side PSA form includes this provision.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on specific performance for pre-Closing breaches.
- **Fallback**: Specific performance is appropriate for Seller's obligation to convey (not for cure of representations). Accept specific performance of the obligation to sell but maintain that breaches of representations are remediable only through termination (pre-Closing) or damages (post-Closing).
- **Pushback**: Buyer insists on reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses if termination is caused by Seller's willful breach.
- **Fallback**: Accept expense reimbursement for willful breach (Seller intentionally caused the representation to become untrue) but cap the reimbursement at a fixed dollar amount (e.g., $100,000-$250,000) and exclude any damages for lost profits or opportunity cost.

### Risk Assessment
The remedy provisions are the enforcement mechanism for the representations. A comprehensive limitation-of-remedy clause (sole remedy, no consequential damages, cure period, cap, basket) converts the representations from a potentially unlimited liability into a defined, manageable risk.

### Asset-Type Variations
No significant variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Sole and exclusive remedy clauses are generally enforceable in all US jurisdictions between sophisticated parties, subject to exceptions for fraud.
- Some jurisdictions may not enforce limitations on damages for fraud or willful misconduct. The fraud carve-out discussed under the liability cap section may be legally required in certain jurisdictions regardless of the contract terms.
