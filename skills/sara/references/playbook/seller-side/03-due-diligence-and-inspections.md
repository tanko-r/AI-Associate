# Due Diligence and Inspections -- Seller Side Playbook

This playbook addresses the negotiation of due diligence and inspection provisions in commercial real estate purchase and sale agreements from the seller's perspective. It synthesizes institutional practice across seven precedent forms, including pro-buyer, pro-seller, and balanced forms, and is designed for use by AI agents during contract review.

---

## 1. Due Diligence Period Length and Structure

### Preferred Position
- Grant the shortest DD period that a credible institutional buyer can accept: 25-30 calendar days for stabilized assets, measured from the Effective Date (not from delivery of DD materials).
- The period should be defined by a specific fixed calendar date and time (with time zone specified), not a floating or contingent start date.
- The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 1.4) defines the Due Diligence Deadline as a fixed date: "_____p.m. Pacific Time, on __________, 20__." The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 171) sets a specific date range: "commencing on August 2, 2021 and ending at 5:00 p.m. East Coast time on August 31, 2021." Both are ideal formulations for seller.
- Do NOT tie the commencement of the DD period to delivery of DD materials. If buyer insists on this, seller loses control over the closing timeline.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Fixed date is non-negotiable**: Seller should insist that the DD deadline is a date certain, not a formula. This provides certainty for seller's marketing timeline and avoids disputes over when DD materials were "fully delivered."
- **Calendar days, not business days**: Use calendar days for the DD period to keep it short. Use business days only for sub-deadlines (notice periods, response windows).
- **No DD extension rights**: Seller should not grant buyer any right to extend the DD period. If buyer presses, see Section 14 below for fallback positions.
- **Pre-contract access**: Where possible, provide buyer with data room access before PSA execution. This allows seller to negotiate a shorter DD period because buyer has already begun its investigation.
- **Time-of-day cutoff**: Specify time of day and time zone. Use a business-hours cutoff (5:00 p.m.) in seller's time zone to maximize seller's certainty about when the period expires.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands 45-60 days**: Counter with 30 days if data room is pre-populated. If buyer has had pre-contract access, 25 days is defensible. Accept 45 days only for complex multi-tenant properties or portfolio deals, and only if buyer posts a meaningful deposit.
- **Buyer demands floating start date tied to DD material delivery**: Resist strongly. If buyer insists, accept only a limited day-for-day extension for specifically identified "critical" DD items (e.g., title commitment, rent roll) rather than the entire materials list. The UNICO Seller Side form does NOT include a day-for-day extension provision (unlike the Buyer Side), which is the correct seller position.
- **Buyer demands bifurcated DD periods**: Resist unless seller benefits from early commitment on specific issues (e.g., separate title review period that expires before the general DD period).
- **Fallback chain**:
  1. Best: 25-30 day fixed period, no extension, no floating start.
  2. Good: 30-35 day fixed period, no extension.
  3. Acceptable: 45 day fixed period with no extension, or 30 days with one 15-day extension requiring additional non-refundable deposit.
  4. Maximum: 60 day period for complex assets, with deposit going hard (or partially hard) at midpoint.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk**: Long DD period (60+ days) with no commitment from buyer. Seller takes the property off market and buyer walks at the last minute.
- **Mitigation**: Require meaningful earnest money deposit that goes hard at or shortly after DD expiration. Structure additional deposits at interim milestones.
- **Medium risk**: Floating start date -- seller cannot predict when DD will expire because it depends on when all DD materials are delivered.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office/Industrial (single tenant NNN)**: 25-30 days is typical and defensible.
- **Multi-tenant office/retail**: 30-45 days may be necessary due to lease complexity.
- **Multifamily**: 30 days is typical for stabilized; 45 for value-add.
- **Data Center**: 45-60 days may be necessary due to specialized infrastructure DD.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: Competitive market often features no DD period at all, or a very short one. Seller has strong leverage.
- **California**: Time-is-of-the-essence is strictly enforced, favoring seller's fixed-date approach.
- **Oregon (Meadows form)**: Uses "Property Approval Period" with a fixed end date. Standard.
- **Washington (Income Property form)**: Fixed date approach. Standard.

## 2. DD Deadline Mechanics: Deemed Approval on Silence

### Preferred Position
- **Deemed approval on silence (strongest seller position)**: If buyer fails to deliver a termination notice by the DD deadline, buyer is deemed to have approved all DD and the deposit becomes non-refundable.
- The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 3.2) provides: "If Purchaser fails to deliver the Purchaser Approval Notice by the Due Diligence Deadline or if Purchaser delivers the Purchaser Disapproval Notice on or before the Due Diligence Deadline, then this Agreement shall terminate." However, note that this form actually uses the deemed-termination approach. The stronger seller position is the Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.2): "If Purchaser fails to give such notice [of termination] prior to the expiration of the Study Period, it shall conclusively be deemed to have elected to waive its right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 5.2, the Deposit shall be non-refundable...and Purchaser shall be obligated to purchase the Property in accordance with the terms hereof." The Income Property Seller form (Section 5.3) similarly provides: "If Buyer fails to deliver the Termination Notice to Seller on or before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall be deemed to have timely provided an Approval Notice."
- This structure ensures that if buyer's investment committee fails to reach a decision in time, the deal proceeds rather than terminating.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Three structures (in order of seller preference)**:
  1. **Silence = deemed approval, deposit goes hard** (Detailed Seller Side, Income Property Seller): Buyer must affirmatively terminate; silence = deemed approval. STRONGEST SELLER POSITION.
  2. **Buyer must deliver affirmative approval or termination notice; silence = termination** (UNICO Buyer Side): Buyer must deliver "Buyer Approval Notice" to proceed. WEAKEST SELLER POSITION.
  3. **Buyer must deliver termination notice; silence = termination** (UNICO Seller Side as written): Hybrid that protects buyer from inadvertent commitment but still requires buyer to act.
- **Deposit consequences**: Regardless of the deadline mechanism, ensure the PSA clearly states that upon expiration of the DD period without termination, the deposit becomes "non-refundable" except for specifically enumerated carve-outs (seller default, title failure, casualty/condemnation, estoppel failure). Limit the carve-outs.
- **"Conclusively deemed"**: The Detailed Seller Side form uses "conclusively be deemed" -- this is the strongest possible formulation and resists subsequent buyer arguments of mistake, inadvertence, or changed circumstances.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands deemed termination on silence**: This is the UNICO Buyer Side approach. Resist. If buyer insists, accept only if:
  - Buyer posts a larger initial deposit (fully at risk immediately upon deemed termination of DD).
  - Buyer must deliver notice 3-5 business days before the DD deadline confirming its intent (allowing seller to plan).
- **Buyer demands reminder notice**: Some buyers request that seller send a reminder 5 days before the DD deadline. This is non-standard and creates risk for seller (if seller fails to send reminder, buyer may argue the deadline was extended). Resist.
- **Compromise**: Require buyer to deliver written notice of its election (either to proceed or terminate) by the deadline. Silence is treated as deemed approval (seller's preferred default outcome).

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Deemed approval on silence is enforceable in virtually all jurisdictions and protects seller from buyer's procrastination.
- **Medium risk**: If buyer has a habit of making last-minute demands, deemed approval may lead to a buyer that is technically committed but seeks to renegotiate terms post-DD.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No meaningful variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: PSA Checklist acknowledges both structures and notes the risk to each party. Courts enforce time-is-of-the-essence provisions.
- **All jurisdictions**: Deemed approval provisions are generally enforceable in commercial transactions between sophisticated parties.

## 3. Seller's Delivery Obligations: Controlling the Scope

### Preferred Position
- Seller should control the scope and timing of DD material delivery. The goal is to provide sufficient materials to support buyer's DD while protecting seller from:
  - Overly broad document requests that create a "fishing expedition."
  - Day-for-day DD extensions triggered by alleged delivery failures.
  - Liability for the accuracy or completeness of provided materials.
- Seller should deliver DD materials within 3-5 business days after the Effective Date, either by physical delivery or posting to an online data room. The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 3.3) uses "Delivered Due Diligence Items" as defined on "Exhibit C" and provides for data room posting.
- The materials list should be defined on an exhibit and limited to items "in Seller's possession or control."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **"Possession or control" -- narrow definition**: The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 3.3) defines "Seller's possession or control" as "information or materials located in files maintained by Seller or its property manager at the property management office serving the Property or at Seller's main office but excluding items in dead storage." This narrow definition is seller-protective. Resist buyer's attempts to expand it to include materials held by seller's affiliates, former property managers, or professional advisors.
- **No day-for-day extension**: The UNICO Seller Side form does NOT include a day-for-day extension for delayed DD material delivery (unlike the Buyer Side form). This is the correct seller position. If buyer insists on some protection, see fallback below.
- **Disclaimer of accuracy**: Include a clear disclaimer: "Any information provided or to be provided by Seller with respect to the Property is solely for Purchaser's convenience and Seller has not made any independent investigation or verification of such information and makes no representations as to the accuracy or completeness of such information, except to the extent expressly provided in Article 5" (UNICO Seller Side, Section 3.3). This disclaimer should be broadly worded and should cover all DD materials, not just specific categories.
- **Seller's Excluded Materials**: Include a robust "Seller's Excluded Materials" definition. The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 3.3) defines these as: (a) prior acquisition DD reports; (b) appraisals or valuation analyses; (c) drafts of reports; (d) internal reports, analyses or communications; and (e) attorney-client communications. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 116) uses "Excluded Items" with an even broader scope including communications with property manager/leasing broker, budgets, strategic plans, and engineering/environmental reports. The Meadows form similarly excludes internal memoranda, appraisals, and financing documents.
- **Ongoing requests**: Limit seller's obligation to provide additional materials beyond the initial exhibit. The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 3.3) requires seller to make available "any other written information concerning the Property, to the extent in Seller's possession or control" but subject to the Excluded Materials carve-out and requiring 2 business days' notice. This is acceptable.
- **Completeness qualifier**: The UNICO Seller Side form requires only "copies of" the listed items -- not "true, correct and complete copies" (which is the Buyer Side formulation). Use "copies of" without the accuracy qualifier.
- **Data room**: Seller should maintain control of the data room, including the right to add, update, or supplement materials. The data room provides a record of what was made available to buyer and when.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands day-for-day extension for delivery delays**: Resist. If buyer insists, limit the extension to:
  1. Specific "critical" items only (e.g., title commitment, rent roll, executed leases), not the entire list.
  2. A maximum extension cap (e.g., 10 business days).
  3. Require buyer to notify seller in writing of the specific missing items before any extension is triggered.
- **Buyer demands expanded materials list**: Accept reasonable additions but ensure each item is qualified by "to the extent in Seller's possession or control." Do not agree to create new documents for buyer's benefit.
- **Buyer objects to Excluded Materials**: The Excluded Materials concept is standard in institutional deals. Resist narrowing it. If buyer pushes back on environmental report exclusions, consider providing prior Phase I reports (which are non-privileged and commonly shared) while retaining exclusion of internal analyses and attorney-client materials.
- **Buyer demands "true, correct and complete" delivery standard**: Counter with "copies of" or "copies of, to the extent in Seller's possession or control." If buyer insists on "true and correct," limit it to specific items (e.g., leases, rent roll) and qualify with "in all material respects."

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Seller controls the scope of delivery and includes a broad disclaimer. Buyer's DD is buyer's responsibility.
- **Medium risk**: If seller fails to deliver material items (e.g., leases, environmental reports) and buyer later claims it would have terminated had it received them, seller may face liability notwithstanding the disclaimer.
- **Mitigation**: Ensure the data room is comprehensive and well-organized. Track delivery dates. Respond promptly to buyer's supplemental requests.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office**: Standard DD materials list. Include HVAC maintenance records, elevator inspections, facade inspection reports.
- **Industrial**: Include environmental reports in the data room (even though they may be "Excluded Materials" under the definition, seller benefits from showing transparency).
- **Retail**: Include lease abstractions showing co-tenancy, exclusivity, and kick-out provisions. Full CAM reconciliation history.
- **Multifamily**: Include regulatory filings, Section 8 contracts, and unit condition reports.
- **Data Center**: Power infrastructure documentation, interconnection agreements, SLAs.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Washington (RCW 64.06)**: Environmental section of Seller Disclosure Statement must still be provided even if buyer waives receipt of the full statement. The Income Property Seller form includes this specific waiver with the environmental carve-out.
- **New Jersey (bulk sales)**: NJ Transfer Inheritance Tax Act requires seller to provide certain financial information. Build into DD materials list.

## 4. Site Visit and Physical Inspection Rights

### Preferred Position
- Grant buyer reasonable access for inspections during normal business hours, subject to:
  - Prior written notice (minimum 1-2 business days).
  - Seller's right to accompany buyer and its representatives at all times.
  - No disruption to tenants or building operations.
  - Compliance with all lease provisions regarding access to tenant spaces.
  - Seller's approval for all inspection activities (not unreasonably withheld for non-invasive inspections; sole discretion for invasive inspections).

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Notice period**: 1 business day (UNICO forms) is market standard. Seller may push for 2 business days (Detailed Seller Side form), which is reasonable and preferred.
- **Seller accompaniment**: Seller's right to have a representative present during all inspections is standard across all forms and should be non-negotiable. This protects seller from buyer making unauthorized contact with tenants and ensures seller is aware of any conditions discovered.
- **Business hours limitation**: Restrict inspections to normal business hours. If buyer requests after-hours access, require advance approval and seller accompaniment.
- **Non-disruption**: All forms require buyer to conduct inspections without disrupting tenants or building operations. Seller should enforce this strictly. The UNICO forms (Section 3.4.2) state: "Buyer acknowledges that access to the premises of any tenant under a Lease will be governed by the terms of the applicable Lease."
- **Approval requirement**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.1) requires seller to provide "written notice at least two (2) Business Days before conducting any inspections or communicating with any Tenant" and gives seller the right to be present. This is the seller's preferred standard.
- **Post-DD access**: Buyer's inspection rights should be limited to the DD period for purposes of the DD contingency. Post-DD, buyer may have limited access for lender inspections and pre-closing walk-through only.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands access "at any time prior to Closing"**: The IL Pro-Buyer form (Section 4.05) provides this broad access. Seller should accept but clarify that post-DD access is limited to specific purposes (lender inspections, walk-through) and remains subject to advance notice and seller accompaniment.
- **Buyer demands approval "not unreasonably withheld" for all inspections**: Accept for non-invasive inspections. Retain sole discretion for invasive testing.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Standard access provisions adequately protect seller's interests while providing buyer with necessary information.
- **Medium risk**: If buyer's inspectors damage the property or disrupt tenant operations. Mitigated by indemnification and insurance requirements.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Data Center**: Strict access protocols required to protect tenant data and critical infrastructure. Seller should establish specific rules of conduct.
- **Retail**: Anchor tenants may have lease provisions restricting landlord access. Coordinate carefully.
- **Multifamily**: Access to occupied units requires coordination with tenants. Budget time.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material jurisdictional variation.

---

## 5. Invasive Testing Consent Requirements

### Preferred Position
- Seller should retain sole and absolute discretion over whether to permit invasive testing (Phase II environmental sampling, soil borings, groundwater testing, building materials sampling, etc.).
- This is the standard across all seller-side forms:
  - UNICO Seller Side (Section 3.4.1): "Purchaser may only conduct invasive Inspections of the Property with Seller's prior written consent, which consent may be withheld in Seller's sole discretion."
  - Detailed Seller Side (Section 5.1(g)): "without Seller's prior written consent, which Seller may give or withhold in its absolute discretion, Purchaser shall not conduct any Phase II exams, soil borings, testing or sampling of any surface or subsurface soils, water or other materials, or other invasive tests."
  - Meadows (Section 1.2): "Buyer shall...request Seller's express prior written consent thereto, which consent may be given or withheld in Seller's sole and absolute discretion."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Sole discretion is the market standard**: Seller should not agree to a "reasonableness" standard for invasive testing. Invasive testing can damage the property, disrupt tenants, trigger environmental reporting obligations, and create liability exposure for seller.
- **Procedural requirements**: Require buyer to submit a written description of the proposed testing scope, methods, locations, and contractor identity before seller considers consent. The Meadows form requires buyer to "identify in writing what procedures such party desires to perform and the identity of the contractor or consultant which will perform such work."
- **Conditions on consent**: If seller grants consent, attach conditions:
  - Buyer must use a seller-approved contractor.
  - All testing must be conducted in accordance with agreed-upon protocols.
  - Buyer must promptly repair all boreholes and restore disturbed areas.
  - All samples and results must be shared with seller promptly.
  - Buyer must not disclose results to governmental authorities without seller's prior approval (subject to legal compulsion).
- **Phase I vs. Phase II distinction**: Phase I is non-invasive and should be permitted without seller consent. Phase II (soil borings, groundwater monitoring, building materials sampling) requires seller consent.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands "not unreasonably withheld" standard**: Resist. Sole discretion is market standard for institutional deals. If buyer pushes hard:
  1. Accept reasonableness standard ONLY for Phase II testing recommended by a Phase I conducted by a nationally recognized environmental consulting firm.
  2. Require buyer to share the Phase I report with seller before requesting Phase II consent.
  3. Include conditions on any Phase II testing (approved contractor, protocols, restoration, no government disclosure).
- **Buyer demands termination right if consent is withheld**: This is a stronger buyer ask but still manageable. If buyer terminates during the DD period based on inability to complete environmental DD, buyer was going to terminate anyway. The risk is buyer using this as leverage to extract other concessions.
- **Fallback chain**:
  1. Best: Sole and absolute discretion, no conditions.
  2. Good: Sole discretion, but seller will not unreasonably withhold consent for Phase I-recommended Phase II if buyer submits detailed scope and uses seller-approved contractor.
  3. Acceptable: Sole discretion, but buyer has termination right during DD period if consent is withheld (no incremental risk to seller since DD contingency exists).

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk**: If seller unreasonably withholds Phase II consent and buyer terminates, seller may face questions from subsequent buyers about the same environmental conditions. Consider proactively addressing known environmental issues.
- **Low risk**: If seller's position is defensible (e.g., property has no environmental history, Phase I did not recommend Phase II).

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: Phase II requests are common and expected. Seller should have a standard protocol for Phase II testing that it can offer to buyer.
- **Office/Retail**: Phase II is less common but may be requested for older buildings (asbestos, lead paint) or sites with adjacent contamination sources (gas stations, dry cleaners).
- **Data Center**: Soil borings may be requested for seismic evaluation. Consider granting consent for limited geotechnical borings.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **CERCLA**: Seller should be aware that buyer's Phase I/Phase II testing is designed to establish buyer's CERCLA innocent landowner defense. If seller obstructs this, buyer may argue seller is preventing buyer from establishing a legal defense.
- **State mandatory investigation statutes (NJ ISRA, CT Transfer Act)**: In these jurisdictions, environmental investigation may be legally required. Seller cannot withhold consent if the investigation is required by law.

---

## 6. Insurance Requirements for Inspections

### Preferred Position
- Require robust insurance from buyer and its DD team as a condition of access to the property.
- The Detailed Seller Side form (Sections 153-157) provides the most comprehensive insurance requirements:
  - CGL (occurrence) with combined single limit of $5,000,000 per occurrence and $10,000,000 aggregate.
  - Protective liability, products/completed operations, broad form property damage, contractual liability.
  - Seller named as additional insured.
  - A.M. Best rating of at least A-VII.
  - Renewal certificates 15 days before expiration.
  - 30-day prior notice of cancellation or modification.
  - Primary and non-contributory endorsement.
  - Cross-liability provision.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Coverage amounts**: $5,000,000/$10,000,000 (Detailed Seller Side) is the strongest seller position. $1,000,000 (UNICO forms) is the minimum. The Meadows form requires $2,000,000. For $50M+ deals, push for at least $2,000,000 per occurrence.
- **Additional insured**: Seller, seller's property manager, and seller's affiliates/parent entities should all be named as additional insureds. The Meadows form names Seller "and its successors and assigns," plus specific Shorenstein entities.
- **Auto liability and workers' comp**: The Meadows form requires auto liability ($1,000,000 CSL) and workers' comp. These are reasonable for buyer's contractors.
- **Certificate delivery timing**: Require delivery before first entry, not just before first inspection. This ensures coverage is in place for even a preliminary site visit.
- **Primary and non-contributing**: Require buyer's insurance to be primary and non-contributing with seller's own insurance (Meadows form provision (iv)).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer objects to $5M+ limits**: Accept $2M combined single limit as the floor. Require excess/umbrella if primary limits are below $5M.
- **Buyer objects to naming specific affiliates**: Accept naming "Seller and its managing agent" as the minimum additional insureds.
- **Buyer's consultants cannot provide individual certificates**: Require buyer to carry a blanket policy that covers its consultants' activities, or require a separate contractor policy from each third-party inspector.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Insurance requirements are administrative. The primary risk is a claim arising from buyer's inspections where buyer's insurance is inadequate.
- **Mitigation**: Verify insurance certificates before granting access. Do not permit access without compliant certificates.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Data Center**: Consider requiring higher limits given the value of tenant equipment and potential business interruption.
- **Industrial (hazardous materials)**: Consider requiring pollution liability insurance for environmental consultants.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material variation.

---

## 7. Indemnification for Inspection Activities

### Preferred Position
- Require a broad indemnification from buyer for all liabilities arising from buyer's inspections and activities on the property.
- The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.1(f)) provides the strongest seller formulation: buyer shall "indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Parties against and from any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and liens arising out of or in connection with the inspection of the Property by, or the presence thereon of, Purchaser or its affiliates, representatives, agents, contractors, consultants, employees, or licensees, which indemnification obligation shall survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement." This version has NO pre-existing conditions carve-out.
- The Meadows form (Section 1.2) similarly provides a broad indemnity without a pre-existing conditions carve-out, covering "all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses...arising from any entry on the Property by Buyer or any of Buyer's representatives."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Pre-existing conditions carve-out**: Buyer will almost always request this. The UNICO forms (both sides) include it: "except to the extent arising out of (a) the mere discovery of any pre-existing condition at the Property, or (b) the negligence or misconduct of Seller." Seller should resist this carve-out, but recognize it is increasingly market standard.
  - If seller must accept a pre-existing conditions carve-out, limit it to "the mere discovery of" pre-existing conditions. The word "mere" is important -- it distinguishes between discovering a condition (no liability) and exacerbating a condition (liability). The UNICO formulation achieves this.
  - Do NOT accept a carve-out for "aggravation" of pre-existing conditions. If buyer's borings spread contamination or buyer's testing causes structural damage, buyer should be liable.
- **Seller negligence carve-out**: The UNICO forms carve out seller's own negligence. This is reasonable and difficult to resist -- seller should not be indemnified for its own fault. Accept if limited to "negligence or willful misconduct" (not mere "acts or omissions").
- **Consequential damages exclusion**: The UNICO forms exclude "special, punitive, or consequential damages." Seller should resist this exclusion from the indemnity. If buyer's inspections cause a tenant to exercise a termination right or reduce rent, seller should be compensated.
- **Lien prohibition**: Require buyer to keep the property free of mechanics' liens and other liens arising from inspections. All forms include this requirement.
- **Restoration obligation**: Require buyer to restore the property to its prior condition. The UNICO forms and Meadows form both include this obligation. It should survive termination.
- **Survival**: The indemnity must survive both closing and termination of the agreement. All forms include survival language.
- **Defense obligation**: Seller should have the right to control the defense of any claim if buyer fails to do so. The Meadows form provides that if buyer fails to defend within a specified period, seller may defend and settle at buyer's expense.
- **Scope of indemnified parties**: Extend the indemnity to seller, seller's property manager, seller's affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands pre-existing conditions carve-out**: If seller must accept:
  1. Limit to "mere discovery" -- not aggravation or exacerbation.
  2. Require buyer to immediately notify seller of any pre-existing conditions discovered.
  3. Require buyer to not disclose pre-existing conditions to governmental authorities without seller's prior consent (subject to legal compulsion with notice).
- **Buyer demands consequential damages exclusion**: Accept only if seller retains the right to recover direct damages for property damage, tenant disruption costs, and restoration expenses.
- **Buyer demands mutual indemnification**: Resist. Buyer is the party entering seller's property. Seller's only obligation should be not to be negligent.
- **Fallback chain**:
  1. Best: Broad indemnity, no pre-existing conditions carve-out, no consequential damages exclusion, survival.
  2. Good: Indemnity with "mere discovery" pre-existing conditions carve-out, seller negligence carve-out, survival.
  3. Acceptable: UNICO formulation (pre-existing conditions and seller negligence carve-outs, consequential damages exclusion), survival.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk**: Even with a pre-existing conditions carve-out, buyer's indemnity provides meaningful protection against physical damage to the property and injury claims.
- **High risk if omitted**: Without any indemnity, seller bears all risk of buyer's inspection activities.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: Pre-existing conditions are more likely (environmental contamination). The carve-out is more consequential for industrial properties.
- **Data Center**: Risk of damage to critical infrastructure is high. Indemnity should be particularly robust.
- **All types**: Indemnity is standard and important regardless of asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material variation.

## 8. Tenant Interview Protocols

### Preferred Position
- Seller should maintain strict control over all buyer communications with tenants:
  - No direct buyer contact with tenants without seller's prior written approval (which may be withheld in seller's sole and absolute discretion).
  - Seller arranges all interviews and has the right to have a representative present.
  - Buyer must provide advance notice of proposed meeting topics.
  - All written communications with tenants must be approved by seller in advance.
- The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 3.6) provides the strongest seller position: "Purchaser shall not engage in any written or oral communications with any Tenants without Seller's prior written approval, which may be withheld in Seller's sole and absolute discretion. As to any communications with Tenant authorized by this Agreement or otherwise approved by Seller, Purchaser shall provide Seller or Seller's property manager with the reasonable opportunity to be present at any oral communications and the right to reasonably approve any written communications."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Sole discretion over tenant contact**: Non-negotiable. Unauthorized buyer contact with tenants can disrupt tenant relationships, trigger concerns about changes in ownership/management, and potentially breach lease confidentiality provisions.
- **Seller arranges meetings**: Seller (or seller's property manager) should schedule all tenant meetings. This ensures seller controls timing, attendees, and messaging.
- **Seller presence**: Seller's right to attend all meetings with tenants is non-negotiable. This allows seller to correct any inaccurate statements by buyer and monitor what information is shared.
- **Written communications**: Seller should pre-approve all written communications to tenants. Buyer should not be sending letters or emails to tenants independently.
- **Timing**: The UNICO Buyer Side form targets the first 15 days for interviews. Seller can accommodate this but should not agree to a rigid schedule that becomes a condition of buyer's DD.
- **Government contacts**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.1(i)) includes a broad prohibition on buyer communicating with governmental agencies, with limited exceptions. Include this restriction.
- **Property management and leasing contacts**: The Detailed Seller Side form also requires seller's consent for buyer to communicate with property management, marketing, and leasing personnel. Include this restriction.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands "not unreasonably withheld" consent for tenant meetings**: Resist. The risk of buyer saying the wrong thing to a major tenant is too high. If buyer insists, accept "good faith efforts to schedule" (UNICO Buyer Side formulation) but retain seller's right to attend and the requirement that seller arrange the meetings.
- **Buyer demands right to contact tenants directly**: Reject. Seller must control the tenant interface during the sale process.
- **Buyer demands right to contact government agencies without restriction**: See Section 12 (Zoning/Entitlement Review) for fallbacks.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk**: Unsupervised buyer contact with tenants can create significant problems -- tenant anxiety about ownership changes, premature disclosure of sale price, or buyer inadvertently making commitments to tenants.
- **Mitigation**: Strict protocols, seller attendance at all meetings, and pre-approval of all communications.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office**: Major tenant interviews are standard and expected. Coordinate carefully.
- **Retail**: Anchor tenant interviews may require more sensitivity, especially if co-tenancy provisions could be triggered by ownership changes.
- **Multifamily**: Tenant interviews are less common. Property manager interviews are more relevant.
- **Industrial**: Single-tenant properties -- the tenant interview may be the most important DD activity.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material variation.

---

## 9. Confidentiality of DD Materials

### Preferred Position
- Require comprehensive confidentiality protections for all DD materials and the terms of the transaction.
- The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.3) provides the most robust seller-protective confidentiality provisions:
  - All "Confidential Information" held in strict confidence.
  - Use limited to evaluating the property for purchase.
  - Disclosure limited to buyer's employees, officers, directors, attorneys, accountants, lenders, and investors who have a need to know and have been informed of the confidential nature.
  - Buyer responsible for any breach by its disclosees.
  - Legal compulsion exception with notice requirements.
  - Equitable relief (specific performance and injunction) available without bond requirement.
  - Return and destruction obligations on termination.
  - Survival after termination.
- The Income Property Seller form (Section 5.2) provides basic mutual confidentiality: "Seller and Buyer agree to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential and not make any public announcements or disclosures...without the prior written consent of the other party."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Broad definition of "Confidential Information"**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 103) defines this broadly to include all documents, materials, analyses, proposals, and terms of the agreement. Include the identity of seller's beneficial owners.
- **Permitted disclosees**: Limit to those with a need to know. Require buyer to inform each disclosee of the confidential nature and have them agree to be bound. Buyer should be responsible for breaches by its disclosees.
- **No press releases**: Prohibit buyer from issuing press releases about the transaction without seller's consent, both before and after closing.
- **Governmental disclosure**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.4) requires buyer to notify seller immediately if DD reveals conditions requiring governmental disclosure, and provides that seller -- not buyer -- makes such disclosures. Include a 10-day notice period if buyer is legally compelled to disclose.
- **Equitable relief**: Include specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for breach, with waiver of bond requirement. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.3(d)) includes this.
- **Return/destruction on termination**: Require buyer to return all tangible materials, destroy all extracts and summaries, and certify destruction in writing (Detailed Seller Side, Section 5.3(c)).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands broader permitted disclosees**: Accept addition of "consultants" and "potential equity investors" if buyer remains responsible for breaches and disclosees are subject to confidentiality obligations.
- **Buyer demands post-closing press release rights**: Accept the right to issue a press release after closing, subject to seller's reasonable approval of the content.
- **Buyer resists written certification of destruction**: Accept oral confirmation or email confirmation as a compromise.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk**: Buyer sharing DD materials (especially financial information, lease terms, or purchase price) with competitors or other potential purchasers.
- **High risk**: Buyer disclosing environmental conditions to governmental authorities, triggering enforcement action against seller.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No material variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **All jurisdictions**: Confidentiality provisions are enforceable as contractual obligations. Equitable relief is generally available for breach.

---

## 10. Return of DD Materials on Termination

### Preferred Position
- Require buyer to return all DD materials (originals and copies) to seller on termination, regardless of the reason for termination.
- Additionally, require buyer to deliver copies of all third-party reports obtained by buyer (Phase I environmental, building condition assessments, surveys) to seller without representation or warranty.
- The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.3(c)) provides the strongest formulation: buyer must "promptly deliver to Seller all the Confidential Information (or portions thereof requested by Seller) which is in tangible form, including any copies Purchaser has made and other embodiments thereof" and "destroy all extracts, summaries and compilations thereof and references thereto" and "certify in writing to the Seller that it has done so."
- The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 3.7) requires buyer to deliver "copies of all studies, reports, plats of surveys, title insurance commitments and other documents and other materials obtained by Purchaser in its Due Diligence investigation" (excluding internal reports). The Meadows form similarly requires delivery of "Buyer Reports" at seller's option.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Trigger**: Seller's preferred trigger is termination for any reason. The UNICO forms limit the obligation to termination "for any reason other than a Seller default." This is reasonable -- if seller defaults, seller should not benefit from buyer's DD work product.
- **Buyer's third-party reports**: Seller should receive copies of buyer's environmental reports, building condition assessments, and surveys. These have value to seller in subsequent marketing. Ensure delivery is "without representation or warranty by Purchaser, express or implied, as to the assignability, content, completeness or accuracy" (UNICO Seller Side, Section 3.7).
- **Internal reports exclusion**: Accept exclusion of buyer's "internal reports, analyses or communications" from the return obligation. These are proprietary to buyer.
- **Written certification**: Require buyer to certify in writing that all materials have been returned or destroyed (Detailed Seller Side form standard).
- **Reliance disclaimer**: Accept buyer's disclaimer -- seller should not rely on buyer's reports without independent verification. Seller should commission its own reports for subsequent marketing if needed.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer refuses to share third-party reports**: Push back -- this is increasingly standard in institutional deals. If buyer resists, accept as optional at seller's election (UNICO Seller Side approach: "at Seller's request").
- **Buyer demands return obligation be mutual**: Seller already provides DD materials at its own initiative. Accept mutual return as a clean-up provision.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Return of DD materials is largely administrative. The primary value to seller is receiving buyer's third-party reports (Phase I, PCA, survey) for use in subsequent marketing.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No material variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material variation.

## 11. Environmental Assessments (Phase I / Phase II) -- Seller's Perspective

### Preferred Position
- Permit buyer to conduct Phase I (non-invasive) without restriction. Retain sole discretion over Phase II (invasive) testing -- see Section 5 above.
- Include robust environmental representations qualified by knowledge: seller has not received written notice of Hazardous Materials violations or Environmental Law violations (UNICO forms, Section 5.1.10).
- Include comprehensive "as-is" and release provisions covering environmental conditions -- see Section 15 below.
- Include broad CERCLA waiver/release (Detailed Seller Side, Section 7.1(b)-(c)).

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Phase I**: Non-invasive; permit without restriction. Phase I is standard and expected by all institutional buyers and their lenders.
- **Phase II**: See Section 5. Sole discretion is the standard.
- **Environmental representations**: Limit to knowledge-qualified, notice-based representations. The UNICO formulation (Section 5.1.10) is the market standard: "Seller has received no written notice from any Governmental Entity or neighboring property owner as to: (a) the existence of any Hazardous Materials on the Property in violation of any Environmental Law; or (b) the current violation of any Environmental Laws with respect to the Property."
- **CERCLA waiver**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 7.1(b)) includes an express waiver of CERCLA claims: buyer waives the right to "implead the Seller," "bring a contribution action...against the Seller," or "attempt in any way to hold the Seller responsible." This is the strongest seller protection and should be included in every deal where achievable.
- **Unknown claims waiver**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 7.1(c)) includes a waiver of unknown claims, expressly waiving the provisions of any state law equivalent to California Civil Code Section 1542. Include this in all deals.
- **Reporting obligation**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.4) requires buyer to notify seller immediately if DD reveals conditions requiring governmental disclosure, and seller controls the disclosure. Include this.
- **Survival**: Environmental representations should survive for a limited period (6 months per UNICO Seller Side; 12 months per UNICO Buyer Side). Seller should push for the shorter period.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer resists CERCLA waiver**: The CERCLA waiver is a significant ask and sophisticated buyers will push back. Fallback positions:
  1. Best: Full CERCLA waiver including contribution, impleader, and unknown claims (Detailed Seller Side form).
  2. Good: CERCLA waiver limited to pre-existing conditions known to buyer at closing (based on DD materials and Phase I report).
  3. Acceptable: No CERCLA waiver, but robust "as-is" provision and release covering environmental conditions, with express carve-out only for seller's surviving representations.
  4. Minimum: Standard "as-is" provision with environmental representations qualified by knowledge.
- **Buyer demands broader environmental representations**: Resist expanding beyond the notice-based, knowledge-qualified standard. Seller should not represent that the property is "free of contamination" or "in compliance with all Environmental Laws" -- these are absolutes that buyer's own DD should confirm.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk**: If seller is aware of unremediated contamination and fails to disclose, seller faces fraud liability regardless of the as-is provision.
- **Medium risk**: If environmental representations are too broad (unqualified compliance representations), seller may be liable for conditions it did not know about.
- **Mitigation**: Limit representations to knowledge-qualified, notice-based formulations. Include robust as-is and release provisions.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: Environmental risk is highest. CERCLA waiver is most valuable to seller. Expect significant buyer pushback.
- **Retail**: Gas station outparcels and dry cleaners create specific risks. Phase II requests are common for these subareas.
- **Office**: Environmental risk is lower but asbestos, lead paint, and PCBs in older buildings remain relevant.
- **Data Center**: Diesel fuel storage for generators is a specific risk.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New Jersey (ISRA)**: Environmental investigation is mandatory at transfer. Seller must comply regardless of as-is provisions.
- **Connecticut (Transfer Act)**: Similar mandatory investigation.
- **California**: Section 1542 waiver is standard in commercial deals but must be express.
- **All jurisdictions**: Fraud and intentional concealment survive as-is provisions and CERCLA waivers.

---

## 12. Zoning and Entitlement Review -- Seller's Perspective

### Preferred Position
- Restrict buyer's direct contact with governmental authorities. Require buyer to:
  - Notify seller in writing at least 2 business days before contacting any governmental agency.
  - Not disclose the purchase price or any financial terms of the transaction.
  - Not request any inspections of the property by governmental authorities.
  - Use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid triggering any inspections.
  - Not communicate with any governmental agency except the zoning and building departments for the limited purpose of confirming compliance.
- The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.1(i)) provides the most protective seller formulation.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Purchase price confidentiality**: Non-negotiable. Buyer must not disclose the purchase price to governmental authorities.
- **No inspection requests**: Buyer must not request building inspections, fire inspections, or code compliance inspections that could trigger violation notices.
- **Limited exception**: Permit buyer to contact zoning and building departments to confirm compliance. This is standard and expected.
- **Advance notice to seller**: Require notice so seller can monitor and, if necessary, correct any issues before a government agency acts.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands unrestricted government contact**: Reject. At minimum, require advance notice, no price disclosure, and no inspection requests.
- **Buyer demands right to contact environmental agencies**: Resist. Environmental agency contact should go through seller (Detailed Seller Side, Section 5.4).
- **Fallback**: Accept buyer's contact with zoning, building, fire, and health departments, subject to: (a) 2 business days' advance notice to seller, (b) no price disclosure, (c) no inspection requests, (d) commercially reasonable efforts to avoid triggering inspections.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk**: Buyer triggering a building inspection that reveals code violations, resulting in enforcement action against seller before closing. This is a real and significant risk.
- **Mitigation**: Restrict buyer's government contacts and require advance notice.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office (older buildings)**: Building code compliance issues are more common. Government contact restrictions are more important.
- **Industrial**: Environmental agency contact is particularly sensitive.
- **Retail**: Health department contact for food service operations can trigger inspections.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York City**: DOB violations are a significant concern. Buyer's contact with DOB could trigger inspections and violation notices.
- **Chicago**: Similar building department concerns.

---

## 13. Financial Audit Rights -- Seller's Perspective

### Preferred Position
- Provide buyer with access to books and records "in Seller's possession or control" during the DD period, subject to:
  - Reasonable advance notice (2 business days).
  - Review at seller's office or property management office during normal business hours.
  - Exclusion of Seller's Excluded Materials.
  - No independent audit right (buyer reviews documents; seller does not grant access to general ledger or bank statements).
- The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.1) provides: "Seller agrees to make available to Purchaser...copies of all Leases and all applicable books and records relating to the Property and the operation and maintenance thereof to the extent that such materials are in Seller's possession or control and do not constitute Excluded Items."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Scope**: "Books and records relating to the Property and the operation and maintenance thereof" -- not seller's internal financial records, tax returns, or investment analyses.
- **Excluded Items**: Apply the Excluded Materials carve-out to financial records. Internal memoranda, budgets, strategic plans, and projections are excluded.
- **Location**: Require review at seller's office, not delivery to buyer. This allows seller to monitor what buyer reviews and copy.
- **Operating statements**: Provide 3 years of operating statements plus year-to-date. This is market standard and expected.
- **Post-closing audit rights**: Resist. Seller's cooperation should be limited to providing the closing proration statement and reasonable support for proration adjustments (typically 120-180 days post-closing).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands access to general ledger and bank statements**: Resist. Provide operating statements and supporting invoices for material items, but not raw financial systems access.
- **Buyer demands 5+ years of operating history**: Provide 3 years as the standard. Accept 5 years only if readily available.
- **Buyer demands post-closing audit cooperation for 1+ year**: Resist. Accept 180-day cooperation period for proration adjustments, with a specific mechanism for resolving disputes.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Financial DD access is standard and buyer needs this information to underwrite the deal.
- **Medium risk**: If seller's operating statements are materially inaccurate and buyer relies on them for underwriting. Mitigated by the DD materials disclaimer and as-is provision.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office/Retail**: CAM reconciliation history is critical. Provide 3 years.
- **Multifamily**: Operating expenses and capital expenditure history are key. Regulatory filings may also be required.
- **Industrial (NNN)**: Financial DD is simpler; focus on lease payment history.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material variation.

---

## 14. Buyer's Right to Extend DD Period -- Seller's Perspective

### Preferred Position
- No extension right. The DD period should be fixed and final.
- If seller must grant an extension right, require:
  - Written notice before expiration of the initial DD period.
  - Payment of a non-refundable additional deposit as consideration.
  - A single extension of no more than 15 days.
  - Automatic extension of the closing date by the same period.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **No extension is the default**: The UNICO Seller Side form and the Detailed Seller Side form do NOT include buyer DD extension rights. This is the market standard for seller-driven transactions.
- **If seller must grant an extension**:
  - Require non-refundable additional deposit ($50,000-$250,000, or 25-50 bps of purchase price). The purpose is to demonstrate buyer's seriousness and compensate seller for additional time off market.
  - Limit to one extension of 15 days maximum.
  - Extension should not reset or modify any other deadlines (e.g., title objection date, estoppel deadline).
  - Require that buyer demonstrate it has been "proceeding with its Inspections in a diligent manner" (IL Pro-Buyer form standard). This gives seller an argument to deny extension if buyer has been dilatory.
- **Auto-extension for DD material delivery delays**: Resist -- see Section 3 above. If seller must accept some form of this, limit it to specific critical items with a maximum cap.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands free extension right**: Reject. If buyer needs more time, buyer should negotiate a longer initial DD period.
- **Buyer demands refundable additional deposit for extension**: Reject. The additional deposit must be non-refundable (except for seller default) to provide genuine consideration.
- **Buyer demands multiple extensions**: Reject. One extension only.
- **Fallback chain**:
  1. Best: No extension right.
  2. Good: One 15-day extension with $100,000+ non-refundable additional deposit.
  3. Acceptable: One 15-day extension with $50,000 non-refundable additional deposit and diligence requirement.
  4. Maximum: Two 15-day extensions with escalating non-refundable deposits ($50,000 first, $100,000 second).

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk**: Extension rights keep the property off market for longer and create uncertainty for seller.
- **High risk**: Unlimited or free extension rights signal a buyer who is not committed.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Data Center**: Extensions may be more justifiable given specialized DD requirements.
- **Industrial (environmental)**: Phase II testing can take 4-8 weeks for lab results, potentially justifying an extension. But seller should push for buyer to commence testing immediately.
- **Stabilized assets**: Less justification for extensions.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material variation.

---

## 15. DD Materials Disclaimer and AS-IS Provisions

### Preferred Position
- Include comprehensive DD materials disclaimer and as-is provision.
- **DD disclaimer**: "Any information provided or to be provided by Seller with respect to the Property is solely for Purchaser's convenience and Seller has not made any independent investigation or verification of such information and makes no representations as to the accuracy or completeness of such information, except to the extent expressly provided in Article 5" (UNICO Seller Side, Section 3.3).
- **AS-IS provision**: The most comprehensive examples are:
  - Detailed Seller Side form (Section 7.1(a)-(b)): 21-item list of disclaimed matters, express waiver of reliance.
  - Meadows form (Section 4.6): Extensive AS-IS with 12-item disclaimer list.
  - Income Property Seller form (Section 7.1): 18-item disclaimer list with express buyer initials.
- **Release**: Include a broad release of seller and seller parties from all claims related to the condition of the property, subject only to seller's surviving representations (Detailed Seller Side, Section 7.1(c); Meadows, Section 4.6; Income Property, Section 7.3).
- **Covenant Not to Sue**: The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 7.1(d)) includes this as an affirmative defense. Include where achievable.
- **Anti-sandbagging**: Include a provision that buyer's representations are automatically deemed modified by buyer's knowledge as of the end of the Study Period. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 295) provides: "All of Seller's representations and warranties shall automatically be deemed modified to reflect Purchaser's Knowledge as of the end of the Study Period."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Buyer initials requirement**: The Income Property Seller form and Meadows form require buyer to initial the as-is provision. This provides evidence of conspicuous presentation and buyer's awareness. Include where possible.
- **Specificity**: The more specific the disclaimer list, the stronger the provision. Include every conceivable category (value, income, suitability, physical condition, environmental, zoning, compliance, construction quality, plans, etc.).
- **Carve-out for seller's representations**: All as-is provisions must carve out "Seller's express representations and warranties" that survive closing. This is standard and unavoidable.
- **Anti-sandbagging provision**: The UNICO Seller Side form includes an optional anti-sandbagging clause (Section 5.4) that waives buyer's claims if buyer "knew" the representation was untrue at closing. The Detailed Seller Side form deems buyer to have knowledge of all information in the "Documents" (broadly defined). Include the strongest anti-sandbagging provision achievable.
  - Buyer's "deemed knowledge" should include all information in DD materials, all matters disclosed by seller, and all matters discoverable through reasonable inspection.
  - The Income Property Seller form (Section 60) provides: "Buyer shall be 'deemed to have known' that a representation or warranty was untrue, inaccurate or incorrect at the time of the Closing if any Property Information furnished or made available to or otherwise obtained by Buyer contains express information which is inconsistent with such representation or warranty."
- **CERCLA release**: See Section 11 above.
- **Unknown claims waiver**: Include express waiver of unknown claims, citing Civil Code Section 1542 (California) or equivalent state law where applicable.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer resists as-is**: In institutional commercial real estate transactions, as-is is essentially market standard. If buyer resists, it signals unsophisticated counsel or an attempt to expand seller's liability exposure. Seller should insist on as-is as a non-negotiable term.
- **Buyer carves out fraud**: This is reasonable and standard. Seller's as-is provision should not protect against seller's fraud or intentional concealment. Accept this carve-out.
- **Buyer resists anti-sandbagging**: Push back. The anti-sandbagging provision incentivizes buyer to conduct thorough DD and raises issues during the DD period rather than asserting post-closing claims. If buyer resists the full anti-sandbagging provision, accept a compromise: buyer's claims are waived to the extent buyer "actually knew" (not "should have known") that the representation was untrue.
- **Buyer resists CERCLA release**: See Section 11 fallback chain.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Comprehensive as-is and release provisions significantly limit seller's post-closing exposure.
- **Residual risk**: Seller's surviving representations (limited by knowledge qualification, survival period, and cap) remain the primary source of post-closing liability.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: AS-IS and environmental release provisions are most critical.
- **All types**: AS-IS is standard across all commercial asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **California**: Section 1542 waiver must be express and conspicuous.
- **Oregon**: Unknown claims waivers are generally enforceable in commercial transactions.
- **Washington**: The Income Property Seller form includes RCW 64.06 waiver provisions specific to Washington.
- **All jurisdictions**: Fraud and intentional concealment survive as-is provisions.

---

## 16. Seller's Excluded Materials

### Preferred Position
- Include a robust Excluded Materials definition that protects seller's proprietary information and privileged materials from disclosure.
- The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 3.3) defines "Seller's Excluded Materials" as:
  (a) Prior acquisition DD reports (PCA, title memos, market studies)
  (b) Appraisals or valuation analyses
  (c) Drafts of reports (only final versions provided)
  (d) Internal reports, analyses, or communications
  (e) Attorney-client communications
- The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 116, "Excluded Items") provides an even broader definition:
  (a) Marketing materials and communications with other potential purchasers
  (b) Internal memoranda and projections
  (c) Communications with property manager and leasing broker
  (d) Appraisals, budgets, strategic plans, internal analyses, computer software
  (e) Engineering and environmental reports received by seller or its affiliates
  (f) Attorney and accountant work product, legally privileged materials
  (g) Organizational documents and affiliate communications
  (h) Personal property in management office not owned by seller

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Prior acquisition reports**: Seller's own Phase I, PCA, and market studies from its acquisition are proprietary. Seller should not be required to share these. They may contain attorney-client privileged annotations, internal analyses, or conclusions that differ from current conditions.
- **Environmental reports**: The Detailed Seller Side form excludes environmental reports received by seller. This is the strongest seller position but may face pushback. Be prepared to share non-privileged prior Phase I reports as a compromise.
- **Property manager communications**: Exclude internal communications between seller and its property manager/leasing broker. These may contain strategy discussions, pricing analyses, or negative assessments that seller should not be required to disclose.
- **Budgets and projections**: Exclude all forward-looking financial projections, budgets, and strategic plans. These are proprietary and buyer should develop its own.
- **Dead storage**: The UNICO Seller Side form excludes "items in dead storage" from the "possession or control" definition. Include this exclusion.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands seller's prior environmental reports**: Consider sharing non-privileged Phase I reports (which are commonly shared in the industry). Retain exclusion of environmental reports that are attorney-client privileged, attorney work product, or contain internal analyses.
- **Buyer demands seller's PCA reports**: Resist. Seller's PCA may have been prepared for a different purpose (e.g., lender requirement) and may not reflect current conditions. Buyer should commission its own PCA.
- **Buyer demands property management correspondence**: Resist strongly. These materials may contain sensitive strategy discussions.
- **Fallback chain**:
  1. Best: Detailed Seller Side form Excluded Items definition (broadest).
  2. Good: UNICO Seller Side Excluded Materials definition.
  3. Acceptable: Narrower exclusion covering only attorney-client materials, internal memoranda, appraisals, and drafts. Share prior Phase I reports.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Excluded Materials provisions are standard in institutional deals and rarely litigated.
- **Medium risk**: If buyer discovers post-closing that seller possessed material information (e.g., a prior environmental report showing contamination) that was excluded from DD materials, buyer may argue fraud or concealment. Mitigated by seller's knowledge-qualified environmental representations.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: Prior environmental reports are the most contentious exclusion. Consider sharing to avoid post-closing disputes.
- **All types**: The exclusion concept is applicable across all asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material variation.

---

## 17. Effect of Prior Early Access Agreements

### Preferred Position
- The PSA should supersede any prior early access agreement, and all inspection activities conducted under the prior access agreement should be retroactively governed by the PSA's provisions.
- The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 3.5.5) provides: "the Prior Early Access Agreement is hereby deemed superseded and replaced by this Agreement and the Inspections and all other activities undertaken by Purchaser, Purchaser's Affiliates or their employees, agents, contractors, consultants and representatives under such Prior Early Access Agreement shall be deemed governed by this Section 3.4."
- The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 92) references a specific "Access Agreement" by date.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Supersession**: Expressly supersede the prior access agreement. Avoid having two overlapping agreements governing buyer's access.
- **Retroactive application of PSA indemnity**: Ensure the PSA's indemnification provisions (which may be broader than the prior access agreement's) apply retroactively to all prior activities. If the prior access agreement had a narrower indemnity (e.g., with a pre-existing conditions carve-out that the PSA does not include), the PSA's broader indemnity should govern.
- **Confidentiality**: Ensure the PSA's confidentiality provisions supersede any more lenient confidentiality in the prior access agreement.
- **Survival**: Ensure that the supersession is effective -- the prior access agreement's obligations do not survive independently alongside the PSA.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer argues prior access agreement terms should apply to activities conducted during the pre-contract period**: Resist. The PSA should govern all activities, retroactively.
- **Buyer wants the more favorable terms of the two agreements to apply**: Reject. The PSA is the final, negotiated agreement and should be the sole governing document.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk if addressed**: Clean supersession eliminates ambiguity.
- **Medium risk if not addressed**: Conflicting indemnification, insurance, or confidentiality obligations.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No material variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No material variation.

---

## 18. Reporting Obligations and Government Contact Restrictions

### Preferred Position
- If buyer's DD reveals conditions requiring governmental disclosure:
  - Buyer must immediately notify seller.
  - Seller (not buyer) decides whether and how to make such disclosures.
  - Buyer may disclose only if legally compelled, with 10 days' prior written notice to seller and cooperation with seller's challenge to the compulsion.
- The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 5.4) provides the model language.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Seller controls disclosure**: This is essential to prevent buyer from triggering governmental enforcement actions (which could affect the property's value and seller's closing timeline).
- **Legal compulsion exception**: Buyer may be legally required to report certain conditions (e.g., environmental contamination). Seller should require maximum advance notice and the right to challenge the compulsion.
- **Government contact restrictions**: See Section 12 above.
- **No inspection requests**: Buyer must not request governmental inspections of the property.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands right to report independently**: Resist. If legally compelled, accept with notice requirement and cooperation with seller's challenge.
- **Buyer's environmental consultant has independent reporting obligations**: This is a real concern. In some states, environmental professionals have mandatory reporting duties. Seller should be aware of this and may want to review the scope of buyer's Phase I before it is commissioned.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk**: Buyer's environmental consultant reports contamination to a state agency, triggering an enforcement action that clouds title and delays or kills the deal.
- **Mitigation**: Restrict government contacts, require seller-controlled disclosure, and require advance notice.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: Greatest risk of triggering environmental reporting obligations.
- **All types**: Government contact restrictions are protective regardless of asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **States with mandatory professional reporting (varies)**: In some jurisdictions, licensed environmental professionals have mandatory reporting obligations that override contractual restrictions. Seller should be aware of this limitation.
