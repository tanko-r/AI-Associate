## Closing Date Structure

### Preferred Position

The Closing Date should be a **fixed date** with no unilateral buyer extension rights, or at most tightly constrained extension rights that require additional nonrefundable deposits. Seller's goals are certainty of timing (particularly for 1031 exchange planning, fund lifecycle deadlines, and capital redeployment), limited market exposure risk, and elimination of buyer delay tactics.

**Preferred sample language (per UNICO Seller Side, Section 1.3 and 11.2):**

> "Closing Date" means ____________, 20__, or such earlier date as may be agreed to by Purchaser and Seller in writing.

The seller's preferred structure limits extensions as follows:

1. **Mutual one-business-day extension** — Each party may extend one time by 1 Business Day, with the extending party authorizing a $5,000 payment to the other party at Closing (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.2). This is a minor accommodation that provides symmetry.
2. **No additional buyer extension right** — The UNICO Seller Side form does not include the additional 20-Business-Day buyer extension that appears in the Buyer Side form. This is the seller's preferred position.
3. **Seller extension for title cure** — Seller should retain the right to extend the Closing Date (typically 7-30 days) to cure title objections at seller's election, not obligation (Meadows, Section 7.2; Detailed Seller Form, Section 6.1(b)).
4. **Closing Statement extension** — Either party may extend the Closing Date to 2 Business Days after agreement on the Closing Statement is reached (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.8).
5. **"Time is of the essence"** — Include an unqualified time-is-of-the-essence provision, subject only to the express extension rights in the PSA (Meadows, Section 9.12).

### Key Negotiation Points

- Resist all buyer extension rights that are exercisable without seller consent. If extensions must be granted, require: (a) substantial additional nonrefundable earnest money (50-100% of original deposit), (b) a short maximum extension period (10 Business Days), and (c) a hard outside date that cannot be further extended.
- The Seller Income Property form provides a favorable extension structure: buyer may extend for one or two periods of specified length, but must pay a nonrefundable Extension Fee, only half of which (for the second extension) is credited to the Purchase Price (Section 8.1).
- Include time-is-of-the-essence language to strengthen seller's termination and liquidated damages rights if buyer fails to close on time.
- Retain seller's right to extend the Closing Date to cure title objections or satisfy closing conditions, but make such extensions discretionary (not obligatory).
- The "on or before" formulation benefits both parties by allowing an early close, but seller should ensure that buyer cannot accelerate the closing to a date that is inconvenient for seller without mutual written agreement.
- Ensure that buyer's financing is explicitly not a condition to closing (UNICO Seller Side, Section 9.3). Any delay caused by buyer's lender is buyer's problem.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer needs extension rights to accommodate lender processing, title cure, estoppel collection, and closing document preparation. Buyer will resist time-is-of-the-essence language at signing.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Grant buyer one extension of up to 10 Business Days, conditioned on deposit of additional earnest money equal to 50% of the original Earnest Money Deposit, which becomes part of (and subject to the same forfeiture provisions as) the Earnest Money Deposit.
2. Grant buyer one extension of up to 15 Business Days with a nonrefundable extension fee (not applied to Purchase Price) equal to $50,000-$100,000, plus additional earnest money of 25% of the original deposit.
3. Allow automatic extensions only for specifically enumerated events (closing statement disagreement, seller title cure, casualty/condemnation notice periods) but not for general buyer needs.
4. If buyer insists on multiple extension rights, require increasing deposits for each extension and impose a hard outside date beyond which no further extensions are available.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — From seller's perspective, an extended closing timeline creates market risk (property values may decline), operational uncertainty (lease negotiations, capital expenditure decisions are in limbo), opportunity cost (capital is tied up), and potential disruption to 1031 exchange or fund distribution timelines.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Data Center:** Buyers may request extended timelines for infrastructure audits and utility capacity verification. Resist extensions beyond 30 days post-diligence absent extraordinary circumstances.
- **Multifamily (agency debt):** If buyer is assuming agency debt, allow a longer initial Closing Date (60-90 days post-diligence) rather than granting open-ended extension rights.
- **Retail:** Anchor tenant estoppel collection can delay closing. Address this through the estoppel condition mechanism rather than general extension rights.
- **Office/Industrial:** Standard 30-45 day closing period post-diligence is appropriate.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Time-is-of-the-essence has specific legal significance. Once properly declared (after initial contract date, by letter with 30 days' notice), it is strictly enforced. Seller should preserve the right to declare TOE by letter after a buyer adjournment request.
- **California:** Courts may not enforce TOE strictly if buyer is ready to close within a reasonable time after the scheduled date. Include explicit liquidated damages provisions.
- **All jurisdictions:** Ensure that "Business Day" is defined consistently and excludes weekends and federal holidays (Meadows, Section 9.16; Seller Income Property, Section 25).

## Closing Procedure (Escrow vs. Table Closing)

### Preferred Position

Seller should agree to an escrow closing through a reputable title company/escrow agent. The PSA should serve as the escrow instructions, and supplementary instructions should not conflict with the PSA. The key seller concern is ensuring prompt disbursement of sale proceeds immediately upon recording.

**Preferred closing mechanics (per UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.3):**

> Provided that all funds and documents required have been deposited into escrow, Escrow Agent shall (i) cause the Deed to be recorded, (ii) pay to Seller by Federal Reserve wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller, the Purchase Price (subject to adjustments), less any costs to be paid by Seller at Closing, and (iii) pay all appropriate payees the other costs and amounts to be paid at Closing.

Seller should also direct the Escrow Agent to pay appropriate payees out of seller's proceeds (commissions, payoffs, transfer taxes) to streamline disbursement (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.3).

### Key Negotiation Points

- Seller's primary concern is receiving net proceeds promptly — by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the Closing Date. The PSA should require buyer to deposit funds by a specific deadline (e.g., 3:00 p.m. local time) and should specify that disbursement follows recording.
- Seller should accept the title company selected by buyer as escrow agent, as this is standard practice and seller's cost exposure is minimal (escrow fees are typically split 50/50).
- Seller should ensure the escrow agent is exculpated from liability except for willful misconduct or gross negligence, and that the escrow agent has interpleader rights if a dispute arises.
- Seller should insist that any supplementary escrow instructions are subordinate to the PSA (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.11).
- If buyer's wire is late but arrives on the Closing Date, seller should have the right to require buyer to pay interest or additional costs imposed by seller's lender for late payoff (Detailed Seller Form, Section 8.4(a): "If the proceeds due from Purchaser are not received by Seller in good funds by 2:00 p.m. East Coast Time on the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall be responsible for any additional interest or other costs imposed by Seller's lender in connection with the payoff of the existing mortgage loan on the Property").

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer may want to select both the title underwriter and the escrow agent. Buyer may resist the late-wire interest provision.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept buyer's selection of escrow agent/title company — this is standard and not worth fighting over.
2. If buyer resists the late-wire interest provision, negotiate for buyer to bear responsibility for "any additional costs incurred by Seller as a result of buyer's failure to timely deliver funds."
3. Accept concurrent (rather than sequential) recording and disbursement where customary in the jurisdiction.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Escrow closing procedures are well-established and the primary risk (delayed disbursement) is addressed by the wire deadline and recording-triggers-disbursement mechanics.

### Asset-Type Variations

No material variations by asset type for closing procedure.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Sit-down closings are customary. Seller should prepare and deliver a gap indemnity to the title company to enable disbursement at closing before recording is confirmed. Seller should ensure its counsel handles the walk-in recording.
- **Illinois:** Escrow closings are standard. If bulk sales clearance is required, escrow agent may need to hold a portion of proceeds pending receipt of clearance certificates.
- **Western states:** Escrow closings are universal. Recording and disbursement occur on the same day.

## Possession Delivery

### Preferred Position

Seller delivers possession on the Closing Date, subject to the rights of tenants under the Leases. Seller's delivery obligation should be limited to what is "in Seller's possession or control." Seller should not warrant the condition of keys, access systems, or building management systems beyond delivery of what it has.

**Preferred sample language (per Meadows, Section 8.2):**

> Subject to the Leases, Seller shall transfer possession of the Property to Buyer on the Closing Date. Seller shall, on the Closing Date, deliver to Buyer the Leases, Contracts, Permits and any other plans and specifications, certificates, licenses and approvals relating to the Property in the possession of Seller.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Possession delivery should be "subject to the Leases" — seller does not warrant that tenants will cooperate with new ownership or that all tenant spaces are accessible.
- Physical items (keys, plans, records) should be delivered "to the extent in Seller's possession or control" — seller should not be responsible for items that are held by third parties (property managers, vendors, tenants).
- Tenant notice letters should be signed by seller at closing and sent by buyer after closing. Alternatively, seller signs and buyer co-signs, with buyer responsible for mailing (Meadows, Section 8.2).
- Seller should not be required to deliver items outside of escrow prior to the recording of the deed and receipt of sale proceeds.
- If seller's property management company is being terminated, seller should cooperate with transition but should not be required to guarantee the property manager's cooperation.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer wants exhaustive possession delivery requirements, including building management system credentials, all original documents, and complete physical access to every portion of the Property.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept delivery of keys, key cards, and access codes "to the extent in Seller's possession or control."
2. Accept delivery of building management system credentials to the extent seller has them, but do not warrant that they are current or functional.
3. Accept a reasonable transition cooperation period (15-30 days post-closing) during which seller makes its property managers available for questions, but at buyer's expense if the cooperation extends beyond routine matters.
4. Resist any obligation to deliver possession prior to the Closing Date or prior to receipt of sale proceeds.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Possession delivery obligations are straightforward for seller. The "to the extent in Seller's possession or control" qualifier provides adequate protection.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Data Center:** Buyer may demand detailed infrastructure documentation, monitoring system credentials, and vendor contact information. Accept delivery "to the extent in Seller's possession or control" and include a reasonable transition cooperation period.
- **Office:** Building management system transition can be complex if seller uses a proprietary management platform. Seller should cooperate but not guarantee full data migration.
- **Multifamily:** High volume of unit keys and amenity access items. Accept delivery of what seller has but do not warrant completeness.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Security deposit transfer requirements under NY GOL Section 7-105 are mandatory. Seller must transfer deposits and provide written notice to tenants within 5 days of closing. Factor this into closing logistics.
- **All jurisdictions:** Possession delivery is contractual. Ensure the PSA language matches seller's actual ability to deliver.

## Seller's Closing Deliverables

### Preferred Position

Seller should deliver only those documents that are standard, customary, and within seller's ability to prepare and execute. Seller should resist expansive deliverables lists that include operational documents, historical records, and open-ended catch-all provisions. Each deliverable should be in a form attached as an exhibit to the PSA, negotiated at signing.

The standard seller deliverables are:

1. **Deed** — Special warranty deed (or bargain and sale deed with covenants against grantor's acts in New York), conveying fee simple title subject only to Permitted Exceptions. Seller should insist on a special warranty deed (warranting only against seller's own acts) rather than a general warranty deed (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.4.1; Detailed Seller Form, Section 8.3(a); Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(a)).

2. **Bill of Sale** — Conveying Personal Property, but without representations regarding condition. Seller should resist "good and marketable title" language for personal property — the bill of sale should convey personal property "as is, where is" consistent with the PSA's general "as is" provisions (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.4.4; Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(b)).

3. **Assignment and Assumption of Leases** — Two counterparts executed by seller. Seller should insist that the assignment includes buyer's assumption of all landlord obligations under the Leases from and after closing, and that seller is released from post-closing obligations to the extent assumed by buyer (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.4.2; Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(c)).

4. **Assignment and Assumption of Contracts** — Two counterparts executed by seller, assigning only the Assumed Contracts (those buyer elected to assume during diligence). Seller should terminate all other contracts at its own expense before closing and deliver evidence of termination (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.4.3; Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(e)).

5. **FIRPTA Certificate** — Non-foreign person affidavit pursuant to IRC Section 1445(b)(2) (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.4.5; Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(g); Detailed Seller Form, Section 8.3(d)). This is a standard, non-negotiable deliverable.

6. **Owner's Title Affidavit** — In the form required by the title company to issue the title policy and delete standard exceptions (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.4.6; Detailed Seller Form, Section 8.3(f)).

7. **Entity Authority Documents** — Formation documents, resolutions, incumbency certificates, and certificates of good standing as reasonably required by the title company and escrow agent (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.4.6; Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(h)).

8. **Closing Certificate / Bring-Down Certificate** — Re-certifying that seller's representations and warranties remain true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date, with the right to disclose exceptions (Meadows, Section 7.2: seller has the right to postpone closing up to 7 days to cure any material adverse exception; Detailed Seller Form, Section 8.3(e)). Seller should insist that the closing certificate includes a "subject to changes that do not constitute a Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifier.

9. **Tenant Notice Letters** — Signed by seller, directing tenants to pay future rent to buyer (Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(j); Meadows, Section 8.2).

10. **Closing Statement** — Approved by seller in writing (Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(i)).

11. **Transfer Tax Forms** — As required by applicable jurisdiction, executed by seller (Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(a)).

12. **Keys and Access Items** — All keys to the Property in seller's possession and control, delivered outside of escrow upon closing (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.4.7).

13. **Original Leases and Contracts** — Originals or copies, to the extent in seller's possession and control, delivered outside of escrow (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.4.7; Seller Income Property, Sections 8.3(d), (f)).

14. **Catch-All** — "Such other documents as may be reasonably or customarily required by the Title Company or Escrow Agent to issue the Title Policy and close this transaction" (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.5.5). Seller should insist this is limited to documents "customarily required" and should not include open-ended obligations.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Deed type:** Always insist on special warranty deed (or local equivalent). Never agree to a general warranty deed — seller's exposure should be limited to its own period of ownership. In NY, a bargain and sale deed with covenants against grantor's acts is the market standard (NY Checklist).
- **Bill of Sale:** The bill of sale should be "as is" — resist buyer's attempt to add representations about condition, merchantability, or fitness for purpose.
- **Bring-Down Certificate:** Seller should have the right to disclose exceptions to reps and warranties in the bring-down certificate without automatically triggering a closing condition failure. The standard should be material adverse change, not perfection. Per Meadows Section 7.2, seller should have the right to postpone closing by up to 7 calendar days to cure any adverse exceptions.
- **Catch-All:** Limit the catch-all to documents required by the title company and escrow agent — not by buyer's lender or buyer's counsel. Buyer's lender requirements are buyer's problem.
- **Physical deliveries:** All physical items (keys, originals, plans) should be delivered "outside of escrow" and only "to the extent in Seller's possession or control." Do not accept obligations to deliver items held by third parties.
- **Items to resist:**
  - Gap indemnity — resist unless customary in the jurisdiction (New York, Illinois); if required, limit to a reasonable amount and duration.
  - Broker lien waivers — seller pays its broker at closing and should not be required to obtain affirmative lien waivers from brokers it does not control.
  - Updated rent roll certified as "true, correct, and complete" — accept "true and correct in all material respects" and "to seller's knowledge."
  - Books and records, plans, specifications, permits — deliver what is in seller's possession but do not warrant completeness.
  - Evidence of management agreement termination — accept this obligation but ensure seller's property manager cooperation is reasonably within seller's control.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer will insist on an exhaustive deliverables list, gap indemnity, certified updated rent roll, complete books and records, and a catch-all that includes buyer's lender requirements.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept a gap indemnity in jurisdictions where customary (New York, Illinois), but limit it to the lesser of the Purchase Price and the title policy amount, and include a reasonable expiration (typically 6-12 months post-closing).
2. Accept delivery of books and records, plans, and specifications "to the extent in Seller's possession or control," delivered "at the Property" rather than shipped to buyer.
3. Accept an updated rent roll "certified to be true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date to Seller's knowledge."
4. Accept a broader catch-all that includes documents required by buyer's lender, but only to the extent such documents are "customarily required" and do not impose additional liability on seller beyond the PSA.
5. Accept delivery of evidence of management agreement termination, but only to the extent seller has the contractual right to terminate (some management agreements require notice periods that may extend beyond closing).

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Seller's closing deliverables exposure is primarily procedural — ensuring all documents are properly prepared, executed, and delivered on time. The substantive risk lies in the bring-down certificate (potential closing condition failure if reps have changed) and the gap indemnity (potential post-closing liability).

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Building management system and life safety documentation are important to buyer but should be delivered "as available" and "to the extent in seller's possession."
- **Retail:** REA-related deliverables (estoppels, notices of sale) may be required by the REA itself. Review the REA for specific closing requirements that seller must satisfy.
- **Multifamily:** High volume of lease documents and security deposit transfers. Organize closing binders efficiently.
- **Data Center:** Infrastructure documentation demands are extensive. Deliver what is in seller's possession but do not warrant completeness of third-party vendor documentation.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Bargain and sale deed with covenants against grantor's acts. TP-584, NYC-RPT (if NYC), Credit Line Mortgage Certificate. Gap indemnity is standard. ALTA statement is standard.
- **Illinois:** Special warranty deed. State and local transfer tax declarations. Bulk sales certificate or escrow (IL Pro-Buyer, Section 8.01(o)). Plat Act Affidavit if applicable. Gap indemnity is standard.
- **Washington:** Special warranty deed. Real Estate Excise Tax Affidavit (Seller Income Property, Section 8.3(a)). Seller Disclosure Statement (environmental section) per RCW 64.06 (Seller Income Property, Section 32).
- **Oregon:** Special warranty deed with statutory land use disclaimer (Meadows, Section 9.17).
- **California:** Grant deed is the market standard (not warranty deed). Documentary transfer tax affidavit.
- **Texas:** Special warranty deed. No state transfer tax.

## Buyer's Closing Deliverables

### Preferred Position

Seller should require comprehensive buyer closing deliverables that are conditions to seller's obligation to close. The minimum deliverables include:

1. **Purchase Price** — The balance of the Purchase Price in immediately available federal funds, deposited by a specific deadline (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.5.1; Detailed Seller Form, Section 8.4(a)). Include a provision that if funds are not received by a stated time (e.g., 2:00 p.m. local time), buyer is responsible for any additional lender payoff interest or costs.

2. **Assumption Agreements** — Two counterparts each of the Assignment and Assumption of Leases, Assignment and Assumption of Contracts, and Bill of Sale, executed by buyer (UNICO Seller Side, Sections 11.5.2-11.5.4).

3. **Entity Authority Documents** — As required by the title company and escrow agent (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.5.5).

4. **Transfer Tax Forms** — Buyer's portion of required transfer tax declarations.

5. **Buyer's Closing Certificate** — Re-certifying that buyer's representations and warranties remain true and correct as of the Closing Date (Meadows, Section 7.1: seller's obligation to close is conditioned on receipt of Buyer's Closing Certificate).

6. **Tenant Notice Letters** — Co-signed by buyer where applicable.

7. **Closing Statement** — Approved in writing by buyer.

8. **Catch-All** — Documents reasonably or customarily required by the title company or escrow agent.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Insist on a buyer's closing certificate (bring-down of buyer's reps). Even though buyer's reps are typically limited to authority and capacity, a change in buyer's authority status could prevent a valid closing.
- The purchase price wire deadline should be early enough to allow seller to confirm receipt, pay off existing debt (if applicable), and arrange for disbursement on the same Business Day.
- If buyer is assuming existing debt, require delivery of all lender-required assumption documents as a buyer closing deliverable (UNICO Seller Side, optional text at Section 11.5).
- Buyer's deposit of the Purchase Price into escrow is a condition to seller's obligation to close (UNICO Seller Side, Section 10.2.4).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer will resist the buyer closing certificate and the late-wire interest provision. Buyer may also resist delivering a catch-all of documents.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept that the buyer closing certificate is limited to buyer's representations as stated in the PSA (no new reps at closing).
2. If buyer resists the late-wire interest provision, accept removal but include language that buyer acknowledges the importance of timely delivery and that late delivery may constitute a default.
3. Accept a narrower catch-all limited to documents required by the title company (not documents required by seller's counsel or seller's lender).

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — The primary risk is buyer's failure to timely deliver the Purchase Price. Seller's protection is the earnest money deposit (liquidated damages) and the closing condition requiring buyer's deposit of funds.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily (agency debt assumption):** Buyer's lender-required deliverables may be extensive. Ensure the PSA requires buyer to deliver all assumption documents required by the existing lender.
- **All other asset types:** Standard buyer deliverables are sufficient.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Buyer may need to execute TP-584 and NYC-RPT forms, and mortgage recording tax affidavits for new financing.
- **Washington:** Buyer must execute Real Estate Excise Tax Affidavit and consumer use tax return (Seller Income Property, Sections 8.4(b), (e)).
- **Illinois:** Buyer must execute state and local transfer tax declarations.

---

## Closing Costs Allocation

### Preferred Position

Seller should minimize its closing cost exposure. The seller's preferred allocation shifts as many costs as possible to buyer:

**Seller pays:**
- 50% of escrow agent's escrow fee
- Standard coverage portion of the owner's title insurance policy premium
- Seller's broker commissions
- Real estate excise tax / transfer tax (in jurisdictions where custom or statute assigns this to seller)

**Buyer pays:**
- 50% of escrow agent's escrow fee
- Extended coverage portion of the owner's title policy premium, all endorsements, and related sales tax
- Cost of recording the deed (Note: UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.6.3, shifts deed recording to buyer, unlike the Buyer Side form which assigns it to seller)
- All survey costs
- All due diligence costs
- Buyer's lender title policy premium
- Buyer's broker commissions
- Buyer's own legal fees
- Additional costs customarily charged to buyers

**Each party pays:**
- Its own legal fees

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Transfer taxes:** This is the largest variable cost item. In many jurisdictions, local custom or statute assigns transfer taxes to the seller. Seller should accept this where it is clearly mandated but should negotiate 50/50 splitting in jurisdictions where custom is ambiguous.
- **Deed recording:** The UNICO Seller Side form assigns deed recording costs to buyer (Section 11.6.3), while the Buyer Side form assigns them to seller. Seller should push for buyer to pay recording costs.
- **Title insurance:** The allocation of standard coverage to seller and extended coverage / endorsements to buyer is market standard and should be preserved. Never agree to pay the full owner's policy premium.
- **Survey:** Surveys are always buyer's cost — seller should never agree to pay for surveys.
- **"Customary" charges:** Include a fallback to "customary charges in the state and county where the Property is located" to cover unenumerated items.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer will try to shift all transfer taxes, deed recording, and potentially the full title premium to seller. In a buyer's market, seller may need to make concessions on closing costs.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept paying all transfer taxes where required by local statute or clear custom (most jurisdictions).
2. Accept paying deed recording costs if buyer concedes on another cost item.
3. If buyer insists on seller paying the full owner's title policy premium (standard plus extended), negotiate an offsetting credit or purchase price adjustment.
4. Never agree to pay buyer's survey costs, due diligence costs, lender title policy costs, or buyer's legal fees.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Closing costs are a pure economic negotiation point. On large deals, the transfer tax alone can be millions of dollars. Seller should budget for transfer taxes as a cost of sale and negotiate the remaining items.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Data Center:** Sales/use tax on personal property transfer can be significant. Negotiate that buyer pays all sales/use taxes on the Personal Property component.
- **All asset types:** Transfer tax rates are property-value-based in most jurisdictions. No material variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Seller pays NYS Real Property Transfer Tax (0.4%/$3M threshold, 0.65% above) and NYC Real Property Transfer Tax (1.425% for commercial above $500K). Combined approximately 2.075% for NYC commercial properties. This is non-negotiable by custom and effectively by statute.
- **Washington:** Seller pays Real Estate Excise Tax (graduated rates up to 3.0% for amounts above $3M). Seller also pays transfer tax by custom (Seller Income Property, Section 8.5).
- **Illinois/Chicago:** State transfer tax ($0.50/$500), County ($0.25/$500), City of Chicago ($3.75/$500 for commercial, higher above $1M). Custom is seller pays state and county; City of Chicago is split or negotiated.
- **California:** Seller typically pays county documentary transfer tax. City transfer taxes vary. San Francisco has steep additional transfer taxes (up to 6% for transactions above $25M).
- **Oregon:** No general real property transfer tax.
- **Texas:** No state transfer tax. Minimal recording fees.

---

## Mutual Deliverables

### Preferred Position

Seller should accept standard mutual deliverables:

1. **Closing Statement** — Both parties must approve the final closing statement. Seller should ensure it has adequate review time (at least 3 Business Days for the preliminary statement) (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.8).

2. **Escrow Instructions** — The PSA serves as escrow instructions, with supplementary instructions subordinate to the PSA (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.11).

3. **Transfer Tax Forms** — Both parties execute as required.

4. **1031 Exchange Cooperation** — Seller should insist on exchange cooperation language, as seller is more likely to be effecting a 1031 exchange as part of a disposition. Key provisions: buyer cooperates at no additional cost or delay; buyer is not required to take title to exchange property; Closing Date is not extended or accelerated (UNICO Seller Side, Section 16.7).

5. **Section 6045(e) Reporting** — Both parties designate the escrow agent as Reporting Person (UNICO Seller Side, Sections 11.12.1-11.12.2).

### Key Negotiation Points

- 1031 exchange cooperation is critical for seller — ensure the PSA includes robust cooperation language that covers seller's qualified intermediary arrangements, assignment of exchange rights, and direct deeding to buyer without passing through the intermediary.
- The closing statement timeline should give seller adequate time to verify prorations and coordinate with its existing lender for payoff.
- Ensure the PSA does not prohibit or restrict seller's ability to effect a 1031 exchange.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Mutual deliverables are generally non-controversial. The only significant pushback may be on 1031 exchange cooperation — buyer may worry about additional complexity or delay. Hold firm that cooperation is "at no cost or delay to buyer" and that the Closing Date is not affected.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Standard provisions.

### Asset-Type Variations

No material variations by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** 1031 exchange qualification is governed by federal tax law (IRC Section 1031) and is jurisdictionally neutral. However, some states (California) do not fully conform to federal 1031 exchange treatment for state income tax purposes, which may affect seller's decision-making.

---

## Post-Closing Obligations

### Preferred Position

Seller's post-closing obligations should be minimized. Seller's goals are: (a) prompt resolution of prorations, (b) limited duration of any post-closing cooperation obligations, (c) preservation of the right to dissolve the selling entity within a reasonable time after closing, and (d) minimal ongoing exposure to buyer claims.

**A. Proration Reconciliation and True-Up**

The reconciliation period should be short and definitive. Seller's preferred approach:
- All prorations are tentatively calculated at closing based on the best available data.
- Either party may request an adjustment within 90 days of closing (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.9). After 90 days, the closing statement is "binding and conclusive" against the party that failed to request an adjustment.
- Until final reconciliation, buyer and its representatives may access seller's books and records "during normal business hours" (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.9).

For operating expense pass-throughs, seller should prepare and deliver the final reconciliation within 60-120 days post-closing (Seller Income Property, Section 8.7; Meadows, Section 8.5(b)). This is seller's obligation because seller has the historical expense data.

**B. Transition Cooperation**

Seller should cooperate with buyer's transition for a limited period (30 days maximum) and at buyer's expense for any extraordinary requests. Seller's obligation should be limited to "reasonable cooperation" — not guaranteeing the availability or cooperation of third parties (property managers, vendors, utility companies).

**C. Post-Closing Access to Books and Records**

Seller should permit buyer access to seller's books and records for a limited period (6-12 months post-closing) during normal business hours with reasonable advance notice (Meadows, Section 8.6). This is necessary for buyer's proration verification and audit rights.

**D. Security Deposit Transfer**

Cash security deposits should be transferred or credited at closing. Letter of credit transfers may require post-closing cooperation with issuing banks — seller should use "commercially reasonable efforts" to effect the transfer within 15-30 days. Seller's obligation should terminate once the transfer is complete or the letter of credit expires by its terms.

**E. Delinquent Rent Collections**

Seller should retain the right to pursue collection of delinquent rents attributable to seller's period of ownership, but without the right to terminate any lease or evict any tenant (Meadows, Section 8.4(b); Seller Income Property, Section 8.5(e)). Rents collected by buyer from delinquent tenants should be applied:
1. First, to current amounts owed to buyer
2. Second, to buyer's reasonable collection costs
3. Third, to seller's arrearages

Buyer should be obligated to bill and attempt to collect delinquent rents in the ordinary course, but seller should accept that buyer is not obligated to engage collection agencies or file suit.

Any rent received by buyer after closing that belongs to seller should be "held in trust and remitted to Seller" promptly (Meadows, Section 8.4(b)).

**F. Mail Forwarding**

Accept a reasonable obligation (6 months) to forward property-related mail received by seller after closing.

**G. Entity Dissolution**

Seller should preserve the right to dissolve or wind up the selling entity after closing. Buyer may negotiate for a non-dissolution period (typically 6-12 months) or a holdback/guaranty to secure post-closing obligations. Seller should resist open-ended non-dissolution covenants.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Reconciliation deadline:** 90 days is seller's preferred deadline. If buyer requests 120 days, accept for operating expense pass-throughs but hold 90 days for all other items.
- **Binding and conclusive:** The provision that the closing statement becomes "binding and conclusive" against a party that fails to request an adjustment within the deadline is critical for seller to achieve finality (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.9).
- **Post-closing holdback:** Resist any post-closing holdback or escrow for proration obligations. If buyer insists, limit to 1% of Purchase Price with a 90-day release.
- **Books and records access:** Limit to 1 year post-closing, during normal business hours, with reasonable advance notice, and at buyer's expense.
- **Delinquent rent:** Insist that buyer remits seller's share of collected delinquent rents promptly — include a "held in trust" obligation.
- **Entity dissolution:** Accept a non-dissolution covenant only for the shorter of (a) 6 months post-closing or (b) the representation survival period. After that, seller should be free to dissolve the entity.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer will want extended reconciliation periods (180 days), extended books and records access (2+ years), a non-dissolution covenant matching the representation survival period, and a post-closing holdback.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept 120 days for operating expense pass-through reconciliation, 90 days for all other items.
2. Accept 1-year books and records access period.
3. Accept a non-dissolution covenant for 12 months post-closing, or the representation survival period, whichever is shorter.
4. If a holdback is unavoidable, limit to 1% of Purchase Price, held in an interest-bearing escrow, with automatic release at the earlier of resolution of all claims or 180 days post-closing.
5. Accept a parent guaranty of post-closing proration obligations as an alternative to a holdback, if available.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Post-closing obligations represent seller's tail risk after closing. The primary exposures are proration true-ups (which can be material on large multi-tenant properties) and representation survival claims. Seller should ensure all post-closing obligations have definite expiration dates.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Operating expense reconciliations are the most complex. Seller should ensure its accounting team or property manager is available for 120 days post-closing to prepare the reconciliation schedule.
- **Retail:** REA reconciliations and percentage rent audits add complexity. Seller may need access to buyer's books to verify percentage rent calculations for the closing year.
- **Industrial (NNN):** Minimal post-closing proration complexity.
- **Multifamily:** High volume of security deposit transfers. Ensure all deposits are properly credited at closing to avoid post-closing disputes.
- **Data Center:** Power cost and infrastructure maintenance reconciliations. Ensure metering data is transferred at closing.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Security deposit transfer is governed by NY GOL Section 7-105 (mandatory transfer within 5 days and written notice to tenants). Seller must comply regardless of PSA provisions.
- **California:** New owner assumes liability for security deposits regardless of actual transfer (Cal. Civ. Code Section 1950.7). Seller should ensure all deposits are actually transferred to avoid buyer claims.
- **Illinois:** Bulk sales clearance may require post-closing follow-up if certificates were not obtained before closing.
- **All jurisdictions:** Further Assurances clauses should be reciprocal and survive for a defined period (not indefinitely from seller's perspective).

## Closing Statement Mechanics

### Preferred Position

Seller should ensure the closing statement process allows for adequate review and does not create a unilateral buyer closing condition:

1. **Preliminary Statement:** Escrow agent prepares at least 5 Business Days before closing.
2. **Seller Review:** Seller reviews and provides comments. Seller should have the right to propose the initial proration calculations (Meadows, Section 8.4: "Seller shall provide to Buyer a draft proration schedule").
3. **Final Statement:** Parties agree on final statement at least 2 Business Days before closing.
4. **Extension Trigger:** If agreement cannot be reached, either party may extend — but this should not be a unilateral buyer right to delay indefinitely.
5. **Proration Cut-Off:** Seller is credited for income and debited for expenses through the day before closing. Buyer is responsible for the Closing Date and all subsequent days (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.7.1).

### Key Negotiation Points

- Seller should prepare the initial proration calculations because seller has the historical data and accounting records. This gives seller first-mover advantage on the proration amounts.
- The proration method (actual days/365-day year) is standard and acceptable (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.7.2).
- Insurance policies should not be prorated — buyer arranges its own insurance. Seller should receive credit for transferable utility deposits (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.7.3).
- If utility meters cannot be read on the Closing Date, utility charges should be prorated outside of escrow within 60 days (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.7.3).
- Real estate tax prorations based on prior year's rate (if current year is not yet fixed) are standard, with a true-up when actual bills are issued.
- Seller should receive credit for prepaid expenses (insurance premiums, annual service contracts, prepaid taxes) that extend beyond the Closing Date.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer may want to prepare the initial proration calculations, or may want a longer review period.

**Acceptable fallback positions:**

1. Accept that the escrow agent (neutral third party) prepares the initial calculations based on information provided by both parties.
2. Accept a 7-Business-Day preliminary statement deadline if buyer is preparing the draft.
3. Hold firm on the extension trigger — it should be mutual, not unilateral.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Closing statement disputes can delay closing. The extension trigger mechanism provides a safety valve, but seller should ensure it does not become a tool for buyer delay.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office/Retail:** Operating expense pass-through prorations are the most complex. Seller should prepare detailed supporting schedules.
- **Industrial (NNN):** Simpler prorations.
- **Multifamily:** Volume of tenant accounts increases administrative burden.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Proration conventions are contractual. Ensure the PSA is explicit about the cut-off time, calculation method, and reconciliation deadline.

## Escrow Agent Provisions

### Preferred Position

Seller should accept standard escrow agent provisions. The key seller-specific concerns are:

1. **Prompt Disbursement:** Escrow agent must disburse seller's proceeds by wire transfer on the Closing Date, immediately upon recording.
2. **Escrow Agent Selection:** Accept buyer's title company as escrow agent — this is standard.
3. **Dispute Interpleader:** If a dispute arises, escrow agent may interplead funds to court. Seller should ensure the interpleader provision does not give buyer a basis to tie up proceeds without a bona fide dispute.
4. **Investment:** Funds should be in interest-bearing, federally insured accounts. Pre-closing interest accrues to buyer's account; post-closing interest on amounts due seller accrues to seller's account (Seller Income Property, Section 9.2).
5. **Escrow Agent Liability:** Limited to willful misconduct or gross negligence.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the escrow agent's disbursement obligation is triggered by recording of the deed, not by buyer's additional approval or satisfaction of post-closing conditions.
- The escrow agent should not have discretion to withhold disbursement absent a written dispute notice from a party or a court order.
- Interest allocation should be explicit — buyer gets pre-closing interest on the deposit; seller gets interest on undisbursed proceeds that accrue after closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Generally non-controversial. Accept buyer's title company as escrow agent.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Standard provisions.

### Asset-Type Variations

No material variations by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Seller's attorney sometimes acts as deposit escrow agent. This is acceptable for the down payment deposit but the title company should handle the closing escrow.
- **All other jurisdictions:** Title company as escrow agent is standard and acceptable.
