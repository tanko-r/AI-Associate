# Purchase Price, Deposits, and Payment Mechanics -- Seller Side Playbook

---

## 1. Purchase Price Structure

### Preferred Position
The purchase price should be stated as a fixed, all-cash amount payable in immediately available federal funds at closing, with no conditions, contingencies, or adjustment mechanisms that could reduce the price below the agreed figure. The seller wants certainty of proceeds. Sample language from the ASB Hardware Block form (seller side):

> "The Purchase Price for the Property shall be [AMOUNT] and No/100 Dollars ($[AMOUNT]). Subject to the adjustments and apportionments as hereinafter set forth, the Purchase Price shall be paid on the Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds."

The seller should resist any purchase price adjustment provisions tied to occupancy levels, rent collections, NOI tests, or cap rate floors at closing. These mechanisms create uncertainty and effectively convert a fixed-price deal into a variable-price transaction.

### Key Negotiation Points
- State the purchase price as a gross figure with prorations and credits "as hereinafter set forth." This establishes the anchor price and frames all credits as downward adjustments from the stated number.
- Resist buyer's attempt to include uncapped or loosely defined "credits against the Purchase Price" for items like deferred maintenance, tenant inducement costs, or environmental remediation. Any such credits should be specifically identified, scheduled, and capped.
- For leasing cost credits (TI/LC obligations), provide a detailed schedule (Exhibit L in the UNICO forms) that shows amounts already paid by seller, reducing the credit buyer receives. The UNICO Seller form requires that buyer assumes responsibility for paying remaining Existing Leasing Costs "up to the amount of the credit that Buyer received at Closing" -- this prevents buyer from receiving a credit and then not performing the obligation.
- Buyer's financing is NOT a condition to closing. State this expressly. The UNICO Seller form (Section 9.3): "It is understood and agreed, however, that Purchaser's ability to obtain financing for the acquisition of the Property is not a condition to Purchaser's obligation to close on the purchase of the Property hereunder."
- The ASB form (seller side, Section 6.2(c)) makes it a condition precedent favoring seller that "Seller shall have received confirmation from Escrow Agent that it has received the payment of the Purchase Price."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Buyer demands a purchase price reduction for known deferred maintenance or capital items.** Fallback: Accept a specific, scheduled credit for documented items discovered during DD (e.g., a roof replacement credit of $X based on an engineering report), but only as part of the DD approval process -- not as an open-ended post-DD adjustment mechanism. Tradeoff: A targeted credit is preferable to losing the deal over an issue buyer will discover during DD anyway.
2. **Buyer insists on a rent roll or NOI floor at closing.** Fallback: Reject outright. Seller's operating covenants and rep-and-warranty survival provisions already address this risk. If buyer insists, offer a representation that there have been no material changes to the rent roll since the Effective Date as a compromise. Tradeoff: Representation provides buyer comfort without creating a price adjustment mechanism.
3. **Buyer demands a financing contingency.** Reject this in all institutional transactions. The IL Pro-Buyer form (Section 3.04) includes a full financing contingency, which is the outer bound of buyer aggressiveness: "Purchaser's obligations to pay the Purchase Price...are fully conditioned upon...Purchaser's ability to obtain an unconditional binding written commitment for acquisition financing." No sophisticated seller should accept this. Tradeoff: If the deal is otherwise exceptional, consider permitting a very short financing contingency (15-20 days) that expires before or concurrently with the DD period.

### Risk Assessment
**HIGH** -- Any mechanism that allows the buyer to reduce the purchase price after the LOI stage erodes deal certainty. Seller's primary objective is to receive the agreed price at closing with no surprises.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office/Retail:** Leasing cost credits can be the largest adjustment. Maintain detailed records of TI/LC payments to minimize the credit at closing.
- **Industrial:** Fewer adjustments but watch for buyer's environmental remediation credit demands.
- **Multifamily:** Buyer may request credits for unit renovation costs. Resist unless tied to a specific, documented capital plan.
- **Data Center:** Buyer may demand credits for equipment replacement or power infrastructure upgrades. These should be resisted or specifically negotiated.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Transfer tax allocation between buyer and seller varies by jurisdiction and directly affects net proceeds. In many states, transfer tax is customarily split or allocated by agreement. In New York, the seller pays the state/city transfer tax and the buyer pays the "mansion tax" (if applicable).
- Documentary stamp taxes in states like Florida are seller's responsibility by custom. Factor this into the net proceeds calculation.

## 2. Earnest Money Deposit Amount and Timing

### Preferred Position
The seller wants the largest deposit possible, delivered as early as possible, going hard as quickly as possible. Target structure for a $50M+ deal:

- **Amount:** 3-5% of the purchase price. On the $86M ASB Hardware Block deal, the deposit was $3.5M (approximately 4%). On the $71.5M Meadows deal, the deposit was $2M (approximately 2.8%).
- **Timing:** Deposit should be delivered on the Effective Date (the date the agreement is fully executed). The ASB form requires delivery "on the Effective Date." If this is not achievable, no later than 1 business day after the Effective Date.
- **Automatic termination for non-delivery:** The ASB form provides: "If Purchaser fails to deliver the Deposit to Escrow Agent on the Effective Date, this Agreement shall, at Seller's election, terminate." This is the preferred seller position.
- **Split deposit structure:** If the deal includes a due diligence period, structure the deposit as an Initial Deposit at signing and an Additional Deposit at DD expiration. The Seller Income Property form uses this approach:
  - Initial Deposit: payable within 1 business day, becomes non-refundable immediately (or upon deemed approval).
  - Additional Deposit: payable within 1 business day after Approval Notice or deemed approval.

Sample language from the Seller Income Property form:

> "The Initial Deposit will become non-refundable upon Escrow Holder's receipt except in case of Seller's default hereunder."

### Key Negotiation Points
- Push for the largest possible deposit. A larger deposit (a) demonstrates buyer's commitment, (b) increases buyer's cost of walking away, and (c) provides more meaningful liquidated damages if buyer defaults.
- Insist on a specific dollar amount, not a percentage, to avoid ambiguity.
- Include an automatic termination right if buyer fails to timely deposit. This prevents buyer from tying up the property without putting money at risk.
- For the split deposit structure, the Additional Deposit should be due within 1 business day of the Approval Notice (or deemed approval), not after a longer period. The Seller Income Property form requires it "within one (1) business day."
- The deposit should be held by escrow agent, not returned to buyer or placed in a buyer-controlled account. However, consider the bracketed option in the Seller Income Property form: "Upon receipt, Escrow Holder shall promptly pay the Initial Deposit to Seller." While aggressive, this gives seller immediate access to the funds and eliminates escrow disputes. Use this selectively in strong negotiating positions.
- Ensure the definition of "Earnest Money Deposit" or "Deposit" captures all deposits, additional deposits, and interest thereon, so that the liquidated damages provision captures the full amount.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Buyer offers only 1% deposit.** Fallback: Accept 1% at signing but require an additional 2% at DD expiration for a total of 3%. Tradeoff: Less at risk during the free-look period, but full amount at risk post-DD.
2. **Buyer wants 2-3 business days to deliver the deposit.** Fallback: Accept 2 business days but include the automatic termination provision for failure to timely deliver. Tradeoff: Minimal practical impact since wire processing is routine.
3. **Buyer resists the automatic termination for non-delivery.** Fallback: Accept a notice and cure mechanism (seller gives written notice of non-delivery, buyer has 1 business day to cure). Tradeoff: Adds one day of delay but still provides seller with a termination right.
4. **Buyer resists day-one hard Initial Deposit.** Fallback: Allow the Initial Deposit to be refundable during the DD period but ensure the Additional Deposit is non-refundable immediately upon delivery. Tradeoff: This is the standard UNICO structure and is market for institutional deals.

### Risk Assessment
**CRITICAL** -- The deposit is the seller's primary protection against a buyer who ties up the property and then walks away. An inadequate deposit (too small, too late, too easily refundable) exposes seller to significant opportunity cost.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily:** In hot markets, buyers may offer non-refundable deposits at signing to win competitive bids. Seller should encourage this.
- **Office (multi-tenant):** Standard 2-3% is typical. Push for 3%+ given the complexity and length of the closing process.
- **Industrial:** Standard 2-3%. Single-tenant NNN properties may command higher deposits given the simplicity of underwriting.
- **Data Center:** Deposits of 5%+ are not uncommon given the specialized nature of the asset and limited buyer pool.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** Custom is for seller's attorney to hold the deposit, which gives seller more control over disbursement.
- **California:** Large deposits are standard in competitive markets. Title companies handle escrow.
- **Texas:** Independent Consideration ($100) is legally critical. See Section 3 below.
- Some states impose specific requirements on how escrow agents handle deposits (e.g., separate trust accounts, interest allocation).

---

## 3. Independent Contract Consideration ($100 Hard Money)

### Preferred Position
Always include the $100 Independent Consideration provision. It provides consideration for the buyer's option period (due diligence) and supports enforceability. The seller should be entitled to receive it immediately upon request and retain it regardless of whether the deal closes or terminates. Sample language from the UNICO Seller form:

> "Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) of the Earnest Money Deposit is delivered to the Escrow Agent for delivery by the Escrow Agent to Seller as 'Independent Contract Consideration', and the Deposit is reduced by the amount of the Independent Contract Consideration so delivered to Seller, which amount has been bargained for and agreed to as consideration for Seller's execution and delivery of this Agreement."

### Key Negotiation Points
- Ensure the provision states the consideration is "non-refundable in all events" (Meadows form language).
- The consideration should be payable to seller "immediately upon request" -- not held in escrow until closing.
- At closing, the Independent Consideration should be applied to the Purchase Price, which is standard and acceptable.
- The $100 amount is universal in institutional practice. No need to push for more.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
Buyer pushback on this provision is rare. If buyer resists, it may signal unfamiliarity with institutional practice or a concern about deal commitment. Accept no fallback -- this is a non-negotiable standard provision.

### Risk Assessment
**LOW** -- The $100 amount is immaterial, but the legal protection it provides for enforceability of the option period is important, particularly in Texas.

### Asset-Type Variations
None -- uniform across all asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Texas:** Essential for enforceability of the due diligence option period. Texas courts treat the DD period as an option contract requiring independent consideration.
- **Illinois:** The IL Pro-Buyer form does not include this provision. Seller should add it.
- Universally accepted and recommended regardless of jurisdiction.

## 4. Deposit Going Hard Mechanics

### Preferred Position
The seller's ideal structure is for the deposit to go hard (become non-refundable) as quickly as possible, with the fewest post-hard refund carve-outs. There are two preferred approaches:

**Approach 1: Day-One Hard Money (Strongest Seller Position)**
The Initial Deposit is non-refundable upon receipt by escrow agent, except only in the case of seller default. The Seller Income Property form uses this approach: "The Initial Deposit will become non-refundable upon Escrow Holder's receipt except in case of Seller's default hereunder."

**Approach 2: Hard at DD Expiration via Deemed Approval (Standard Seller Position)**
The deposit becomes non-refundable upon expiration of the DD period unless buyer affirmatively terminates. The UNICO Seller form uses this approach: buyer must deliver an affirmative Buyer Disapproval Notice to terminate; failure to deliver is deemed approval. The ASB form is similar: "If Purchaser fails to give such notice prior to the expiration of the Study Period, it shall conclusively be deemed to have elected to waive its right to terminate...the Deposit shall be non-refundable."

The critical difference from the buyer side: the seller wants silence to equal approval. If buyer does not affirmatively terminate, the deposit goes hard automatically.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Deemed approval mechanism:** Insist that buyer's failure to deliver a termination notice by the DD deadline constitutes deemed approval and makes the deposit non-refundable. The ASB form (Section 5.2) and the Seller Income Property form (Section 5(c)) both use this approach. This is the most important single provision for seller in the deposit section.
- **Minimize post-DD refund carve-outs.** After the deposit goes hard, the only refund triggers should be: (a) seller's material default, and (b) the specific conditions precedent to buyer's closing obligation. The ASB form limits refundability after the study period to Sections 10.1 and 10.3 (seller default and buyer termination for material casualty/condemnation).
- **Estoppel failure as a termination event, not a deposit refund event.** The seller should resist making the estoppel condition a deposit-refund trigger. Instead, if estoppels are insufficient, seller should have the right to (a) extend closing to obtain more estoppels, (b) substitute seller estoppels, and (c) if the condition still fails, the agreement terminates and the deposit is returned -- but this should be the last resort, not the first option.
- **Resist tying deposit refundability to new title exceptions.** After DD, title risk should shift to buyer. The UNICO Seller form does not include a broad post-DD refund right for new title exceptions. Instead, new title exceptions are handled through a notice-and-election process where buyer can accept or terminate, but termination is buyer's sole remedy.
- **Resist buyer's request for a refund if seller's representations are inaccurate at closing.** The preferred seller approach (per the UNICO Seller form, Section 5.3) gives buyer a choice: (a) terminate and receive deposit back, or (b) proceed to close with knowledge of the inaccuracy, waiving claims. Seller should structure this so that buyer has a short window (5 business days) to elect termination, after which buyer is deemed to have elected to proceed.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Buyer insists on affirmative approval (must deliver Approval Notice, or deal terminates).** Fallback: This is the buyer's strongest position and is used in the UNICO Buyer form. If necessary to close the deal, accept this but ensure (a) the DD period is firm with no extensions, and (b) the agreement terminates automatically if no notice is given, preventing buyer from sitting on the fence. Tradeoff: Seller loses the benefit of deemed approval but gains certainty that the deal either moves forward or terminates cleanly.
2. **Buyer demands post-DD refund for estoppel failure.** Fallback: Accept this but limit it to (a) failure to receive conforming estoppels from major tenants only (not all tenants), (b) seller's right to extend closing by 30 days to cure, and (c) seller's right to substitute seller estoppels for non-major tenants. The UNICO Seller form allows seller estoppels for one-half of major tenants and all non-major tenants, which is a reasonable structure.
3. **Buyer demands post-DD refund for new title exceptions.** Fallback: Accept a narrow refund right for new title exceptions that (a) were not created by or through buyer, (b) were not within buyer's knowledge at the end of the study period, and (c) would have a "Material Adverse Effect." The ASB form uses this approach (Section 4.1(b)). Tradeoff: Acceptable because the Material Adverse Effect threshold eliminates frivolous objections.
4. **Buyer demands post-DD refund for material adverse change in representations.** Fallback: Accept, but only for changes that are (a) within seller's control, (b) material, and (c) not cured by seller within a reasonable period (5-10 business days). Changes outside seller's control that are not material should not give rise to a refund right. Tradeoff: Standard and fair; seller retains control by avoiding actions that would make its representations inaccurate.

### Risk Assessment
**CRITICAL** -- The going-hard mechanic determines when seller achieves certainty that the deal will close. Every day the deposit remains refundable is a day the property is effectively off the market with no committed buyer. Maximizing the speed and certainty of the deposit going hard is seller's single most important negotiating objective in this section.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily:** In competitive markets, day-one hard deposits are achievable and should be sought.
- **Office/Retail:** Deemed approval at DD expiration is standard. Post-DD refund triggers for estoppel failures are harder to resist given the complexity of multi-tenant properties.
- **Industrial (single-tenant NNN):** Push for day-one hard or very short DD periods (15-21 days) given the simplicity of underwriting.
- **Data Center:** Longer DD periods are standard (45-60 days) but the deposit should go hard firmly at DD expiration.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- In New York, deposits traditionally go hard at signing (no DD period), though institutional practice has evolved to include DD periods. Seller should leverage New York custom to push for earlier hard-money dates.
- In most Western states, a DD period with buyer's right to terminate is standard, so seller's focus should be on the deemed-approval mechanism.

---

## 5. Additional Deposits

### Preferred Position
The seller should require a substantial additional deposit at DD expiration that brings the total deposit to 3-5% of the purchase price. The additional deposit should be triggered automatically by deemed approval (not only by affirmative Buyer Approval Notice). Sample language from the Seller Income Property form:

> "Within one (1) business day after the earlier of Seller's receipt of the Approval Notice, or the expiration of the Due Diligence Period without Buyer's delivery of a Termination Notice...Buyer shall deliver...the Additional Deposit."

### Key Negotiation Points
- The trigger for the additional deposit should be the earlier of (a) buyer's affirmative Approval Notice, or (b) expiration of the DD period without delivery of a Termination Notice. This ensures the additional deposit is funded even in a deemed-approval scenario.
- The additional deposit should be immediately non-refundable upon delivery, except for seller's default and the limited post-DD refund carve-outs.
- Failure to timely fund the additional deposit should constitute a buyer default, entitling seller to terminate and retain the initial deposit as liquidated damages.
- The additional deposit should be deposited into the same escrow account as the initial deposit.
- Consider requiring the additional deposit to be released directly to seller (the bracketed option in the Seller Income Property form). This is aggressive but provides seller with immediate access to funds.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Buyer resists any additional deposit.** Fallback: Accept a smaller additional deposit (e.g., equal to the initial deposit) rather than no additional deposit. Tradeoff: Total deposit remains lower than ideal but is better than a single small deposit.
2. **Buyer wants the additional deposit held in escrow, not released to seller.** This is standard and should be accepted without significant resistance. Tradeoff: Seller loses immediate access but retains the liquidated damages protection.

### Risk Assessment
**HIGH** -- The additional deposit is a key mechanism for increasing buyer's skin in the game after the free-look period ends.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Generally uniform across asset types. The total deposit amount should scale with the purchase price and the complexity of the transaction.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant jurisdictional variations for the additional deposit mechanism.

---

## 6. Interest on Deposits

### Preferred Position
Interest should follow the deposit: if the deposit is paid to seller as liquidated damages, seller receives the interest. If the deposit is returned to buyer (seller default or permissible termination), buyer receives the interest. The ASB Hardware Block form (seller side) takes this approach:

> "All interest earned on the Deposit shall be deemed to be part of the Deposit and shall accrue to the benefit of Purchaser except to the extent the Deposit becomes payable to Seller pursuant to Section 10.2. In such event the interest earned on the Deposit shall accrue to the benefit of the Seller."

### Key Negotiation Points
- The standard approach (interest follows deposit) is fair and market. Seller should not expend negotiating capital on this issue.
- Ensure the escrow agent invests the deposit in an interest-bearing account. The deposit should not sit in a non-interest-bearing account.
- If the deposit is released directly to seller (day-one hard money), the interest allocation issue is moot since seller holds the funds.
- The IL Pro-Buyer form provides that interest on holdback funds accrues to seller, regardless of how the holdback is disbursed. This is a useful seller protection for holdback structures.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
The interest-follows-deposit approach is universally accepted. No significant pushback is expected.

### Risk Assessment
**LOW** -- Not a material negotiation point.

### Asset-Type Variations
None.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Some states require that interest on deposits held by attorneys be deposited into IOLTA accounts unless the amount justifies a separate interest-bearing account.

---

## 7. Escrow Agent Selection and Duties

### Preferred Position
The seller should have input on escrow agent selection. In New York, it is customary for seller's attorney to hold the deposit, which gives seller maximum control. In other jurisdictions, the seller should ensure the escrow agent is a reputable title company that will follow the PSA's disbursement provisions strictly.

Key provisions seller should include:
- The escrow agent should require joint written instructions from both parties before disbursing the deposit (unless disbursement is clearly directed by the PSA).
- The escrow agent should have an interpleader right in the event of a dispute, with costs borne by the losing party.
- Joint and several indemnification of the escrow agent by both parties.
- The escrow agent's liability should be limited to gross negligence or willful misconduct.
- The escrow agent should execute the PSA (or a joinder) to acknowledge its obligations.

The ASB form includes comprehensive escrow provisions (Section 11.21) that represent best-in-class seller drafting.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Resist the single-party release mechanism** that allows buyer to direct disbursement to itself with only a short objection period. This creates risk that the deposit is released to buyer before seller can object. If buyer insists on this mechanism (common in IL practice), ensure the objection period is at least 10 business days and that seller's objection triggers an automatic hold.
- **Include a no-recording provision:** The PSA should prohibit buyer from recording the agreement or a memorandum of it. The ASB form (Section 11.18) includes a strong no-recording provision with an automatic termination remedy and an irrevocable power of attorney to remove any improper recording. This is a critical seller protection.
- **Escrow agent as IRS Reporting Person:** Designate the escrow agent as the Reporting Person under Section 6045(e) of the Code to avoid seller having to make the report.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Buyer insists on its preferred title company as escrow agent.** Fallback: Accept if the title company is a reputable national company. Tradeoff: Minimal, as long as the escrow provisions are robust.
2. **Buyer resists the no-recording provision.** This is non-negotiable for seller. A recorded memorandum of agreement clouds title and can survive termination of the PSA. Tradeoff: None -- seller must insist on this provision.

### Risk Assessment
**MEDIUM** -- Escrow agent procedures are important but rarely the source of deal-breaking disputes. The no-recording provision is the most critical seller protection in this section.

### Asset-Type Variations
None.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** Seller's attorney holds the deposit. This is a significant advantage for seller.
- **California/Western states:** Title companies hold the deposit. Standard practices are well established.
- **Illinois:** More complex escrow procedures (see IL Pro-Buyer form, Article V) with notice-and-objection mechanisms. Seller should ensure the objection period is sufficiently long.

---

## 8. Payment of Purchase Price at Closing (Wire Transfer Mechanics)

### Preferred Position
The seller wants to receive the full purchase price (net of prorations and credits) by Federal Reserve wire transfer of immediately available funds, with no conditions on disbursement other than recording of the deed. The UNICO Seller form (Section 11.3) provides:

> "Escrow Agent shall (i) cause the Deed to be recorded, (ii) pay to Seller by Federal Reserve wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller, the Purchase Price (subject to adjustments), less any costs or other amounts to be paid by Seller at Closing."

Seller should ensure that all conditions to closing are satisfied before the "Deposit Deadline" so that funds are available for same-day disbursement after recording.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Seller controls the disbursement account.** Wire instructions should be provided by seller to escrow agent, and buyer has no approval right over seller's wire instructions.
- **No holdbacks.** Resist buyer's attempts to hold back portions of the purchase price for post-closing adjustments, repair escrows, or other contingencies. The IL Pro-Buyer form includes a detailed "Holdback" mechanism (Section 18.02(c)) that withholds a portion of the purchase price for post-closing rep-and-warranty claims. This significantly reduces seller's closing proceeds and should be resisted.
- **Deposit Deadline:** Include a firm cutoff time on the closing date (e.g., 3:00 PM local time) by which all buyer funds and documents must be in escrow. If buyer misses the deadline, seller should have the right to extend or treat the failure as a buyer default.
- **Confirmation of funds.** As a condition precedent favoring seller, the ASB form (Section 6.2(c)) requires: "Seller shall have received confirmation from Escrow Agent that it has received the payment of the Purchase Price...and that Escrow Agent is in possession of written authorization from Purchaser to disburse such funds at the direction of Seller at Closing."
- **All prorations and credits flow through the closing statement.** No side agreements or post-closing payment obligations that could delay or reduce seller's proceeds.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Buyer demands a post-closing holdback for rep-and-warranty claims.** Fallback: If a holdback is unavoidable, negotiate for (a) the smallest possible amount (ideally less than 1% of purchase price), (b) a short holding period (90-180 days), (c) interest on the holdback accruing to seller, (d) a basket/deductible before claims can be made, and (e) a hard cap on total claims equal to the holdback amount. The IL Pro-Buyer form provides a framework for this. Tradeoff: Seller receives reduced proceeds at closing but has defined exposure and a defined timeline.
2. **Buyer demands a repair escrow for identified deficiencies.** Fallback: Accept a small repair escrow with (a) a defined scope of work, (b) a defined budget, (c) a defined completion period, and (d) return of unused funds to seller. Tradeoff: Better than a purchase price reduction because seller retains the possibility of recovering the escrowed funds.
3. **Buyer wants a post-closing proration true-up outside of escrow.** This is standard and should be accepted with a defined reconciliation period (60-90 days). Tradeoff: Minimal risk; prorations are typically small relative to the purchase price.

### Risk Assessment
**HIGH** -- The seller's primary objective at closing is to receive the full purchase price in immediately available funds. Any holdback, escrow, or post-closing obligation reduces certainty of proceeds and creates ongoing exposure.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office/Retail:** Post-closing proration true-ups are more common and more significant due to complex tenant reimbursement structures.
- **Industrial (NNN):** Simpler closing mechanics with fewer prorations.
- **Data Center:** Buyer may demand holdbacks for equipment condition or power infrastructure issues. Resist or minimize.
- **Multifamily:** Watch for buyer demands for security deposit escrows in states with specific tenant protection laws.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York (sit-down closing):** Funds are disbursed at the closing table after all documents are executed and title is cleared. Seller has more control over the closing process.
- **Western states (escrow closing):** Disbursement occurs after recording, which may be same-day or next-day depending on the jurisdiction.
- **Gap funding:** In some jurisdictions, recording and disbursement occur simultaneously; in others, there is a "gap" period. Seller should ensure the title company provides gap indemnification.

---

## 9. Purchase Price Allocation (Personal Property vs. Real Property)

### Preferred Position
The seller generally prefers to minimize the allocation to personal property because (a) it may trigger state sales tax, (b) it may result in ordinary income treatment on the personal property portion (Section 1245 recapture), and (c) it reduces the amount allocated to real property, which may have long-term capital gain treatment.

Seller's preferred position: either no allocation provision in the PSA, or a nominal allocation to personal property. If an allocation is included, seller should require that both parties file consistent tax returns and that the allocation is based on a mutually agreed appraisal.

### Key Negotiation Points
- If buyer demands an allocation, require that it be based on a fair market value appraisal of the personal property, not an inflated estimate.
- Ensure the allocation does not trigger sales tax liability for seller. If it does, the PSA should provide that buyer bears the sales tax cost.
- Include a provision requiring consistent tax reporting by both parties.
- The Seller Income Property form includes a clean allocation provision: "The sum of $[AMOUNT] of the Purchase Price shall be allocated to the Personal Property, and the balance shall be allocated to the Real Property." Seller should negotiate for the smallest defensible dollar amount.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Buyer insists on a large personal property allocation for tax purposes.** Fallback: Agree to a reasonable allocation supported by an independent appraisal, with buyer bearing any incremental sales tax and both parties agreeing to file consistently. Tradeoff: Seller may have slightly higher ordinary income, but the issue is rarely material for a seller at the entity level.
2. **Buyer wants to defer the allocation to post-closing.** Fallback: Acceptable if both parties agree in advance to be bound by a mutually agreed appraisal. Tradeoff: Deferring the allocation creates uncertainty, which seller generally disfavors.

### Risk Assessment
**MEDIUM** -- The allocation issue is important for tax planning but rarely a deal-breaker.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Data Center:** Buyer will push hard for a large personal property allocation. Seller should be prepared to negotiate and should obtain its own cost segregation analysis to establish a defensible position.
- **Industrial:** Moderate personal property values. Seller should identify and value personal property pre-listing.
- **Office/Retail/Multifamily:** Relatively small personal property allocations. Less contentious.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Sales tax jurisdictions:** Washington, Texas, and several other states impose sales tax on transfers of personal property. The PSA should clearly allocate this cost.
- **No sales tax jurisdictions:** In states without sales tax (e.g., Oregon), the allocation issue is purely an income tax matter.

## 10. Existing Loan Assumption Mechanics

### Preferred Position
If the property is encumbered by assumable debt, the seller should structure the assumption as a mutual condition precedent and ensure that the process does not unduly delay closing or give buyer leverage to renegotiate the deal. Key seller objectives:

1. **Release of seller's guarantors and indemnitors.** This is the seller's most critical objective in an assumption transaction. The UNICO forms (both buyer and seller) include optional language: "The Existing Loan Assumption Documents shall provide that Seller and the key principals affiliated with Seller shall have no further liability or obligation with respect to any matter relating to the Existing Loan arising after the Closing."
2. **Buyer bears assumption costs.** Seller should push for buyer to pay all lender fees, assumption fees, and lender's counsel fees. The UNICO form leaves this as a blank to be negotiated.
3. **Buyer is responsible for the application process.** Per the UNICO Seller form (Section 2.6.2): "Promptly following delivery of the Buyer Approval Notice...Purchaser shall request approval from Existing Lender to assume the Existing Loan."
4. **Closing date extension limits.** While seller should cooperate, the assumption process should not indefinitely delay closing. Include an outside date beyond which either party may terminate.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Seller cooperation standard:** Seller should agree to "reasonable" cooperation, not "best efforts." The UNICO form uses "reasonable, diligent and good faith efforts," which is a balanced standard.
- **Buyer provides replacement guarantors.** The UNICO Buyer form acknowledges that "Buyer will provide replacement key principals reasonably acceptable to Buyer and sufficient for Existing Lender to do so." From seller's perspective, the replacement guarantors must be acceptable to the lender -- seller should not be forced to close if the lender has not released seller's guarantors.
- **No modification of loan terms without seller's consent.** If the assumption involves modifications to the existing loan terms (e.g., increased reserves, rate adjustments), seller should have approval rights over any modifications that affect seller's obligations or exposure.
- **Existing Loan Assumption Approval definition.** The UNICO form (Section 2.6.6) provides a comprehensive definition. Seller should ensure the definition includes the release of seller's guarantors as a required element.
- **Termination right with deposit return.** Per the UNICO form (Section 2.6.7): "If despite the parties' reasonable, diligent and good faith efforts, the parties are unable to obtain the Existing Loan Assumption Approval at least [X] Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then...this Agreement shall terminate and the Earnest Money Deposit shall be promptly returned to [Buyer/Purchaser]." Seller should accept this because (a) the assumption approval is truly beyond the parties' control, and (b) retaining the deposit in this scenario is inequitable and may be unenforceable.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Buyer wants seller to bear all or half of assumption costs.** Fallback: Split the lender's assumption fee 50/50 but buyer pays lender's counsel fees. Each party pays its own counsel. Tradeoff: Seller bears a portion of the cost but the alternative (buyer refusing to assume) may result in prepayment penalties or a reduced sale price.
2. **Buyer wants broader closing date extension rights for assumption processing.** Fallback: Accept extensions up to a defined outside date (e.g., 90 days after the original closing date) but require buyer to demonstrate that it is diligently pursuing the assumption. Tradeoff: Longer timeline creates uncertainty but may be necessary to complete the assumption process.
3. **Buyer wants to waive assumption and close with new financing.** This may be acceptable to seller if (a) the existing loan can be prepaid without penalty (or buyer bears the prepayment penalty), and (b) seller's guarantors are released at closing through loan payoff. Tradeoff: Simpler closing but potential prepayment penalty exposure.

### Risk Assessment
**CRITICAL** -- In assumption transactions, the seller's exposure continues until the guarantors are released. If the assumption fails and the deal terminates, seller retains the property with the existing debt obligation. If the assumption is structured poorly, seller may be forced to close without a guarantor release, creating ongoing personal liability.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily (agency debt):** Fannie/Freddie loans have established assumption procedures. Seller should be familiar with the specific agency's requirements and timeline.
- **Office/Retail (CMBS):** CMBS assumptions are complex and can take 90-120 days. Seller should factor this into the closing timeline from the outset.
- **Industrial:** Life company loans may have different (and potentially more restrictive) assumption provisions.
- **Data Center:** Specialized lenders may have unique requirements. Seller should review the existing loan documents carefully before signing the PSA.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** Mortgage assignment (not assumption) can save substantial mortgage recording tax. Seller should consider whether the buyer's structure permits a mortgage assignment rather than an assumption.
- **Due-on-sale provisions:** Under the Garn-St Germain Act, commercial loans are generally subject to due-on-sale clauses. The existing loan documents must be reviewed to confirm assumability.
- **State-specific guarantor release requirements:** Some states may impose specific requirements for the enforceability of guarantor releases.

## 11. Purchase Price Adjustments and Prorations

### Preferred Position
Seller's objectives for prorations are:
1. **Receive credit for prepaid expenses** (insurance premiums, property taxes paid in advance, prepaid service contract fees).
2. **Minimize credits to buyer** (challenge buyer's claims for delinquent rent credits, deferred maintenance, and operating expense over-collections).
3. **Receive credit for utility deposits** transferred to buyer.
4. **Prorate rental income based on collections, not billings**, so that seller is not crediting buyer for rents that tenants have not paid.
5. **Limit the post-closing reconciliation period** to prevent buyer from using the true-up process to renegotiate the deal economics.

The UNICO Seller form (Section 11.7.1) provides the standard framework, prorating all revenue and expenses as of 11:59 PM on the day preceding closing.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Rents prorated on collections basis.** Seller's collected rents for the month of closing should be prorated based on the number of days. Uncollected rents should not be credited to seller -- they should be collected by buyer post-closing and remitted to seller under a delinquent rent waterfall. The UNICO Seller form prorates based on "rentals and other income collected from the Property," which protects seller from buyer receiving a credit for rents that have not actually been collected while also ensuring buyer does not pocket the collections.
- **Delinquent rent waterfall.** The UNICO Seller form (Section 7.5) provides a waterfall that applies payments first to the month of closing, then to buyer's period, then to seller's period. From seller's perspective, the waterfall should apply first to the month of closing, then to seller's period, then to buyer's period. The UNICO Buyer form reverses the priority (buyer's period before seller's period). This is a point of negotiation.
- **Post-closing reconciliation period.** The UNICO forms provide 90 days. Seller prefers a shorter period (60 days) to achieve finality more quickly. After the reconciliation period expires, the closing statement should be "binding and conclusive."
- **Tax appeal proceeds.** Seller should retain the right to pursue tax appeals for periods prior to closing and receive the benefit of refunds for those periods. The ASB form (Section 6.6(d)) provides detailed mechanics for this.
- **Annual reconciliation responsibility.** Seller should accept responsibility for preparing reconciliation statements for the year of closing (UNICO Seller form, Section 7.7) but ensure that buyer cooperates in providing necessary information.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Buyer wants rents prorated on accrual basis (billed, not collected).** Fallback: This significantly favors buyer because buyer receives a credit for billed but uncollected rent. Accept only if the rent roll demonstrates near-100% collection rates and buyer provides a representation that it will use good faith efforts to collect delinquent rents post-closing. Tradeoff: Seller gives up the benefit of the collection-based approach in exchange for potentially larger closing proceeds.
2. **Buyer wants a longer reconciliation period (120-180 days).** Fallback: Accept 120 days but insist that the closing statement becomes binding and conclusive after the period expires, with no further adjustments permitted. Tradeoff: Longer period of uncertainty but definitive cutoff.
3. **Buyer wants to control the delinquent rent waterfall (buyer's period first).** Fallback: Accept the UNICO approach (month of closing first, then buyer, then seller) as a compromise. This is balanced because it prioritizes the divided month. Tradeoff: Seller's delinquent rents are last in priority, but seller retains the right to pursue tenants directly (without terminating leases).

### Risk Assessment
**HIGH** -- Proration disputes are among the most common post-closing conflicts. The dollar amounts can be significant on large properties. A well-drafted proration provision with a definitive reconciliation deadline reduces post-closing exposure.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office/Retail:** Complex CAM reconciliations and percentage rent calculations require detailed proration provisions. Seller should prepare a thorough reconciliation as of the proration date.
- **Industrial (NNN):** Simpler prorations. Most expenses are passed through to tenants.
- **Multifamily:** Concession burn-off, utility sub-metering, and turnover costs complicate prorations.
- **Data Center:** Power cost pass-throughs and complex utility arrangements require specialized proration provisions.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Tax proration timing:** In arrears jurisdictions (e.g., Illinois, New Jersey), taxes for the current year are estimated and prorated. Seller should ensure the estimate is reasonable and that the true-up mechanism protects against significant underestimates.
- **New York:** NYC real estate taxes are paid quarterly in advance. Ensure prorations account for prepaid amounts.

## 12. Closing Date Extension Mechanics

### Preferred Position
Seller should have the right to extend the closing date for specific, limited purposes (title cure, estoppel delivery, assumption processing) but should resist giving buyer broad, unilateral extension rights. The UNICO Seller form provides:

1. **Mutual one-business-day extension** with a $5,000 payment to the other party (Section 11.2). This is reciprocal and acceptable.
2. **Seller extension rights:** The ASB form (Section 6.1(b)) gives seller the right to extend closing "for one or more periods of up to sixty (60) days in total" to fulfill conditions precedent. This is a powerful seller protection.
3. **Buyer extension only with additional deposit:** Any buyer extension right should be conditioned on posting an additional deposit. The UNICO Buyer form requires 50% of the original deposit for a 20-business-day extension. From seller's perspective, this is acceptable because it increases buyer's skin in the game.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Seller's broad extension right.** The ASB form gives seller up to 60 days total to extend closing to meet conditions. This is the preferred seller position and protects against technical failures (e.g., one missing estoppel).
- **Buyer extension only with additional deposit.** If buyer seeks extension rights, require (a) an additional deposit (at least 50% of the original), (b) a defined maximum extension period (15-20 business days), and (c) only one extension.
- **Extension fees.** The Seller Income Property form includes an "Extension Fee" for buyer's extensions that may be partially credited against the purchase price. Seller should push for the Extension Fee to be non-refundable and not credited (or only partially credited) against the purchase price.
- **Time of the essence.** Include a "time is of the essence" provision, subject only to the defined extension rights. The Meadows form (Section 9.10) includes this provision.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Buyer demands multiple extension rights.** Fallback: Allow two extensions of 10 business days each, with additional deposit required for each extension. Tradeoff: More total extension time but buyer has more capital at risk.
2. **Buyer resists extension fees.** Fallback: Waive the fee but require an additional deposit that is credited against the purchase price at closing. Tradeoff: No true penalty for extension but buyer puts up additional capital.
3. **Buyer resists "time of the essence."** Fallback: Accept that time is not of the essence but include a defined outside date beyond which either party may terminate. Tradeoff: Less certainty of closing date but a hard backstop.

### Risk Assessment
**HIGH** -- Seller's primary risk is buyer endlessly delaying closing while holding the property off market. Extension rights must be tightly controlled with meaningful conditions.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Generally uniform. Longer extension rights may be necessary for data center and development transactions.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** "Time of the essence" has specific legal significance. Seller should follow proper procedures for declaring time of the essence (30 days notice).
- **Oregon:** The Meadows form includes a general "Time is of the Essence" provision from the outset.

## 13. Liquidated Damages and Default Remedies

### Preferred Position
The deposit-as-liquidated-damages provision is seller's most important remedy. Seller's preferred structure:

1. **Seller's sole remedy for buyer default is retention of the deposit as liquidated damages.** This is standard and benefits seller by providing certainty of damages without litigation. The UNICO Seller form (Section 13.2) and the ASB form (Section 10.2) both use this approach.
2. **Seller expressly waives specific performance against buyer.** This is the market standard and is acceptable because (a) forcing an unwilling buyer to close is impractical, and (b) the deposit provides adequate compensation.
3. **Buyer's remedy for seller default should be limited.** Seller's preferred position: buyer's sole remedy is return of the deposit, period. The UNICO Seller form (Section 13.1) limits buyer's remedy to (a) specific performance (with a short filing deadline) or (b) return of the deposit. No breakage fee. No consequential damages. The Meadows form goes further and includes a cap on out-of-pocket damages: "the right to seek damages for out of pocket costs incurred by Buyer in connection with this Agreement in amount exceed [X] Hundred Thousand Dollars."

Sample language from the UNICO Seller form:

> "IF THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY IS NOT CONSUMMATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT BECAUSE PURCHASER DEFAULTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER SHALL BE ENTITLED, AS ITS SOLE REMEDY, TO RETAIN THE EARNEST MONEY DEPOSIT AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES...SELLER WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO RECOVER DAMAGES OR SEEK SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AGAINST PURCHASER."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Require initialing by both parties.** This establishes mutual acknowledgment and strengthens enforceability.
- **Include a reasonableness finding.** State that "the parties have agreed that...the amount of the Earnest Money Deposit is a reasonable estimate of the damages that Seller would incur." This satisfies the legal standard for liquidated damages in most jurisdictions.
- **Notice and cure periods.** Include a 5-business-day cure period before default remedies are triggered. Both UNICO forms include this. This protects against inadvertent defaults while preserving seller's remedies.
- **Limit buyer's remedy for seller default.** The UNICO Seller form limits buyer to specific performance or return of deposit (no breakage fee). Buyer's right to specific performance should have a short filing deadline (60 days from the scheduled closing date). If buyer fails to file within the deadline, buyer is deemed to have elected return of the deposit.
- **Lis pendens waiver.** Require buyer to waive the right to record a lis pendens. The Meadows form includes this: "Buyer waives any right to record a lis pendens on the Property." This prevents buyer from clouding title as a negotiating tactic. The ASB form also includes a no-recording provision with an irrevocable power of attorney for removal.
- **Surviving obligations.** Ensure that buyer's obligations that survive termination (indemnification for property inspections, confidentiality, broker indemnification) are not affected by the liquidated damages provision.
- **No consequential damages.** Include a mutual waiver of consequential, special, punitive, and exemplary damages. The IL Pro-Buyer form includes this: "in no event shall Seller be liable for any incidental, consequential, indirect, punitive, special, or exemplary damages."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Buyer demands a "Seller Breakage Fee" in addition to return of deposit.** Fallback: Accept a breakage fee capped at a defined dollar amount (e.g., $100,000 or a fraction of the deposit) covering only documented third-party costs (title, survey, engineering, legal). The UNICO Buyer form caps the breakage fee at the deposit amount, which is very aggressive for buyer. Tradeoff: Seller increases its exposure upon default but the cap provides certainty.
2. **Buyer demands unlimited specific performance rights (no filing deadline).** Fallback: Accept specific performance but with a 60-day filing deadline and a requirement that buyer post a bond or make a deposit with the court. Tradeoff: Seller's title is potentially clouded for 60 days, which is manageable.
3. **Buyer refuses to waive lis pendens.** Fallback: Accept buyer's retention of the lis pendens right but include the no-recording provision and the irrevocable power of attorney for removal (ASB form approach). Tradeoff: Seller has a self-help remedy for improper recordings.
4. **Buyer demands actual damages for intentional/willful seller default.** Fallback: Accept liability for actual (not consequential) damages for intentional or willful defaults, but only if specific performance is not available. Cap the exposure at a defined amount (e.g., 5% of the purchase price). The UNICO Buyer form includes this concept: "to the extent the default or breach by Seller was intentional or willful, recover any and all damages arising out of such intentional or willful default." Tradeoff: Creates exposure beyond the deposit but only in the most egregious scenarios.

### Risk Assessment
**CRITICAL** -- The default and remedies provisions define seller's maximum exposure and control the consequences of deal failure. Seller's goal is to ensure that (a) buyer default results in deposit forfeiture with no additional exposure for seller, and (b) seller default results in limited and defined exposure (return of deposit, capped damages, short specific performance window).

### Asset-Type Variations
- Generally uniform. Specific performance is more likely to be sought (and granted) for unique assets like trophy office buildings, prime retail locations, and specialized data centers.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **California:** Civil Code Section 1671 governs liquidated damages. Courts generally enforce reasonable liquidated damages provisions. Deposits of 3-5% are well within the range of reasonableness.
- **New York:** Liquidated damages provisions are enforceable if the actual damages are difficult to determine and the amount is a reasonable forecast of probable harm.
- **Texas:** Courts apply a reasonableness test. The deposit should bear a reasonable relationship to the seller's anticipated damages.
- **Illinois:** The IL Pro-Buyer form includes robust buyer protections (holdback mechanism, Purchaser's Costs reimbursement for willful seller default) that seller should resist or minimize.
- **Oregon:** The Meadows form includes standard liquidated damages provisions with initialing requirements.

## 14. Liability Limitations and Exculpation

### Preferred Position
Seller should include comprehensive exculpation and liability limitation provisions:

1. **Recourse limited to seller's interest in the property.** Post-closing, buyer's recourse against seller should be limited to seller's interest in the property (or, if the property has been sold, the net proceeds actually received). The ASB form (Section 11.16(a)) provides: "Purchaser's recourse against Seller under this Agreement...shall be limited to Seller's interest in the Property (or, following the Closing, to the net proceeds of the sale of the Property actually received by Seller)."
2. **No personal liability for seller's principals.** No owner, manager, employee, officer, director, or agent of seller shall have personal liability. Both the ASB form and the UNICO Seller form include this protection.
3. **Cap on aggregate liability.** Seller's total post-closing liability for rep-and-warranty breaches should be capped at a defined amount (e.g., 5% of the purchase price or the greater of $1M and 5%). The UNICO Buyer form (Section 5.4(b)) provides: "under no circumstances shall Seller be liable to Buyer on account of any breach of any representation or warranty in the aggregate in excess of the amount equal to the greater of (i) $1,000,000 and (ii) 5% of the Purchase Price."
4. **Basket/deductible.** Seller should not be liable for claims below a defined threshold. The UNICO Buyer form (Section 5.4(a)): "Buyer shall not make a claim against Seller for damages for breach or default of any representation or warranty, unless the amount of such claim is reasonably anticipated to exceed $25,000."

### Key Negotiation Points
- Include all four liability limitations (recourse limitation, no personal liability, aggregate cap, and basket/deductible).
- The recourse limitation should survive closing and termination.
- Negative capital accounts and contribution obligations of seller's partners or members should not constitute assets of seller (per the ASB form).
- Acceptance of the deed should constitute full performance of seller's obligations (other than those expressly surviving closing). The ASB form includes this: "The acceptance of the Deed shall constitute full performance of all of Seller's obligations hereunder other than those obligations of Seller that by the express terms hereof survive the Closing."
- Survival period for representations and warranties should be limited (12 months in the UNICO forms, 6 months in the Seller Income Property form). After the survival period expires, all claims are extinguished.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
1. **Buyer demands a higher cap or no cap on seller liability.** Fallback: Accept a cap of 5-10% of the purchase price. Tradeoff: Higher exposure but still defined and limited.
2. **Buyer demands a lower basket.** Fallback: Accept a $10,000-$25,000 basket. Tradeoff: More claims may be brought but the aggregate cap still limits total exposure.
3. **Buyer demands a longer survival period.** Fallback: Accept 12 months (the UNICO standard). Resist anything beyond 18 months. Tradeoff: Longer exposure period but the cap and basket still apply.
4. **Buyer demands personal liability for fraud.** Fallback: Accept personal liability for seller's key principals only in the case of intentional fraud. This is reasonable and market. Tradeoff: Creates personal exposure but only for the most egregious conduct.

### Risk Assessment
**HIGH** -- Without proper exculpation and liability limitations, seller's principals face personal exposure for post-closing claims that could exceed the sale proceeds. These provisions are essential for any institutional seller.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Generally uniform. Higher liability caps may be appropriate for distressed assets or assets with known environmental issues.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Some states limit the enforceability of exculpation clauses. In New York, exculpation provisions in commercial contracts are generally enforceable.
- **Illinois:** The IL Pro-Buyer form includes a detailed exculpation section (Section 18.03) that limits buyer's claims to seller only (not seller's affiliates, officers, etc.). This is the standard approach.
- **California:** Courts may scrutinize exculpation provisions for unconscionability but generally enforce them in arm's-length commercial transactions.
