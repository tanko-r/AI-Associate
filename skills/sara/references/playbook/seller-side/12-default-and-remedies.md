# Default and Remedies -- Seller Playbook

This playbook addresses the full spectrum of default and remedies provisions from the seller's perspective in institutional commercial real estate PSAs ($50M+ transactions). All positions, fallbacks, and negotiation strategies are oriented toward maximizing seller protections -- limiting exposure for seller default, preserving the liquidated damages framework for buyer default, and maintaining control over dispute resolution mechanics. Every section anticipates buyer's counsel's likely pushback and provides structured fallback positions.

## 1. Buyer Default -- Liquidated Damages / Deposit Forfeiture as Seller's Sole Remedy

### Preferred Position
When buyer defaults, seller's remedy is retention of the Earnest Money Deposit as liquidated damages. While this is technically a "limitation" on seller, it is overwhelmingly advantageous because it avoids the cost and uncertainty of proving actual damages and provides immediate, certain recovery. The LD provision should include:

- Express recital that actual damages are difficult or impracticable to determine
- Express recital that the deposit represents the parties' reasonable pre-estimate of seller's damages under the circumstances existing at execution
- The deposit constitutes seller's "sole and exclusive remedy at law or in equity" for buyer's failure to close
- Seller expressly waives its right to specific performance against buyer and its right to pursue actual damages beyond the deposit
- Upon forfeiture, buyer is released from all further liability except for obligations that expressly survive termination (indemnification for property damage during inspections, confidentiality, broker indemnities, and recording prohibition violations)
- Initials lines for both parties confirming the LD provision was negotiated at arm's length and explained by counsel
- Carve-out language preserving seller's rights under surviving obligations as distinct from LD (the Detailed Seller Side form's language -- "This Section is intended only to liquidate and limit Seller's right to damages arising due to Purchaser's failure to purchase the Property and shall not limit the other obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement" -- is essential)

**Cross-reference: UNICO Seller Side (Section 13.2)** -- Provides the core template: deposit as LD, express waiver of specific performance and damages against buyer, full release upon forfeiture except for surviving obligations. Includes capitalized recitals and initials requirement.

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 10.2)** -- The most comprehensive LD provision among the precedents. Includes extended recitals establishing that the parties "made a diligent endeavor to ascertain the actual compensatory damages" and that the deposit represents "the sum equal to the amount of the Deposit" as a reasonable estimate. Also includes the critical carve-out preserving surviving obligations.

**Cross-reference: Seller Income Property Form (Section 11(a))** -- Strong seller-side LD with initials lines and express waiver of specific performance and all other remedies for buyer's failure to close.

**Cross-reference: Meadows (Section 2.3)** -- Follows the same structure: deposit as LD, sole remedy, with initials requirement.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Adequacy of deposit amount.** The LD provision is only as strong as the deposit. For institutional deals, push for deposits in the range of 3-5% of Purchase Price. The deposit should go "hard" (non-refundable) at the expiration of the due diligence period, making it at-risk capital that deters buyer walkaway. If the deal involves staged deposits (initial deposit plus additional deposit at end of due diligence), ensure the LD provision captures the full aggregate deposit.
2. **Breadth of surviving obligations carve-out.** Seller benefits from maintaining carve-outs for obligations that survive termination. These carve-outs are outside the LD framework and allow seller to pursue actual damages for specific items:
   - Buyer's indemnification for property damage during inspections (critical -- buyer's contractors may cause physical damage to the property during due diligence)
   - Buyer's confidentiality obligations (prevents buyer from weaponizing seller's proprietary financial data)
   - Buyer's broker commission indemnity (protects seller from claims by buyer's broker)
   - Recording prohibition violations (if buyer improperly records a memorandum of the PSA or lis pendens, seller should have an independent right to damages beyond the deposit)
3. **No "willful default" carve-out from LD on buyer side.** Buyer's counsel may attempt to carve "willful" buyer default out of the LD cap, arguing that a buyer who deliberately walks away should face uncapped liability. Resist this. The entire purpose of the LD provision is to create certainty for both sides. A "willful default" carve-out on buyer's side introduces the same ambiguity seller wants to avoid -- what constitutes "willful"? The LD provision should apply regardless of the nature or intent behind buyer's default. Seller is made whole by the deposit; the reciprocal benefit is certainty of exposure for buyer, which is what makes sophisticated buyers willing to agree to aggressive deposit amounts.
4. **Express waiver of specific performance against buyer.** Seller should include this waiver. While it may seem counterintuitive for seller to waive the right to force buyer to close, specific performance against a buyer is rarely practical (buyer can raise financing defenses, organizational objections, or other impediments), is expensive to litigate, and delays seller's ability to re-market the property. The LD/deposit forfeiture model provides faster, cleaner recovery.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands a lower deposit (below 2% of Purchase Price).** Fallback chain: (1) 5% hard deposit; (2) 3% hard deposit; (3) 2% hard deposit with additional 1% going hard at removal of final contingency; (4) 1% initial deposit increasing to 3% at end of due diligence. Hard floor: total at-risk deposit must be at least 2% of Purchase Price, or the LD provision lacks commercial credibility.
- **Buyer demands that deposit remain refundable through closing (no "going hard").** This is unacceptable. The deposit must go hard at the end of the due diligence period (at latest). If the deposit is refundable until closing, seller has no meaningful remedy for buyer default because buyer can simply exercise a termination right. Fallback: staged hardening -- 50% goes hard at end of due diligence, remaining 50% goes hard 15 days before closing.
- **Buyer argues the deposit is a "penalty" and unenforceable.** Response: the LD provision includes all requisite enforceability elements -- recital of difficulty of determining actual damages, recital that the amount is a reasonable estimate, initials of both parties, representation that each party was advised by counsel. For institutional deals with deposits in the 1-5% range, courts uniformly uphold LD provisions. Cite: *Truck Rent-A-Center v. Purdy Corp.* (NY); Cal. Civ. Code Section 1671(b) (presumption of validity in commercial contracts).
- **Buyer demands that the carve-out for surviving obligations be narrowly limited to specifically enumerated items.** This is reasonable and seller can accept it, provided the enumerated items include all critical surviving obligations (inspection indemnity, confidentiality, broker indemnity, recording prohibition). The Detailed Seller Side form's approach -- enumerating the carve-out categories -- is preferable to a vague "obligations that survive termination."

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk:** Deposit amount that is too low relative to deal size. A $500K deposit on a $100M deal provides no meaningful deterrent against buyer walkaway, particularly if property values have declined between signing and closing.
- **High risk:** Failure to include express LD recitals and initials. Without these, the LD provision is vulnerable to challenge as a penalty, particularly in jurisdictions with strict scrutiny of LD clauses.
- **Medium risk:** Overly broad surviving obligations carve-out that buyer's counsel could argue effectively circumvents the LD cap. Keep the carve-out carefully delineated.
- **Low risk:** Waiver of specific performance against buyer. This is commercially sensible and market standard.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office (Value-Add/Repositioning):** Seller's actual damages from a failed closing can be substantial if the property has been taken off market, prospective tenants have been put on hold, or capital expenditures have been deferred in anticipation of the sale. Push for deposits at the higher end of the range (3-5%).
- **Multifamily:** In strong rental markets, seller's actual damages may be modest (the asset generates income and can be re-marketed quickly). Deposits of 2-3% are standard.
- **Industrial/Logistics:** High demand and tight supply mean seller can typically re-market quickly. Standard deposits (2-3%) are adequate, though institutional sellers in competitive processes may demand higher deposits.
- **Retail (Anchored Centers):** If the sale process disrupted ongoing lease negotiations or tenant relationships, seller's damages can be significant. Push for 3-5% deposits.
- **Data Centers:** Specialized asset with limited buyer pool. Failed closings can be highly damaging to seller (the property may have been removed from a competitive process, and re-marketing to the small universe of qualified buyers takes time). Push for 5% or higher deposits with aggressive hardening timelines.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **California:** Cal. Civ. Code Section 1671(b) creates a statutory presumption that LD provisions in non-consumer (commercial) contracts are valid. The burden is on the party challenging the provision to show it was unreasonable at the time of contracting. This is highly favorable to seller. Initialing is strongly recommended and required by widespread practice.
- **New York:** NY courts enforce LD provisions unless the amount is "plainly or grossly disproportionate to the probable loss." For institutional CRE transactions with deposits in the customary range, enforceability is virtually assured.
- **Illinois:** IL courts apply a three-part test: (1) intent to agree on LD, (2) reasonableness at time of contracting, (3) difficulty of determining actual damages. Standard institutional PSA recitals satisfy all three elements.
- **Texas:** Texas courts enforce LD if (1) harm is difficult to estimate and (2) the amount is a reasonable forecast of just compensation. Texas is generally LD-friendly for commercial transactions.
- **Oregon:** Oregon follows Restatement (Second) of Contracts Section 356. The Meadows form's LD provision reflects Oregon practice. Enforceability is rarely contested for standard deposit amounts.
- **Colorado / Massachusetts:** The Detailed Seller Side form is governed by Massachusetts law with Colorado venue. Both states enforce LD provisions in commercial contracts under standard reasonableness tests.

## 2. Limiting Buyer's Remedies for Seller Default

### Preferred Position
This is the most heavily negotiated provision in the default article from seller's perspective. Seller's objective is to limit buyer's remedies for seller default to a binary choice: (a) specific performance or (b) termination with deposit return -- and nothing more. No actual damages. No consequential damages. No cost reimbursement. No breakage fee.

Preferred structure:

- Buyer's "sole and exclusive remedy" for seller default is either (a) specific performance of the PSA, or (b) termination and return of the deposit
- If buyer elects termination, seller's only obligation is to return the deposit (no additional payments, no cost reimbursement, no breakage fee)
- If buyer elects specific performance, buyer must commence the action within a short deadline (20-60 days)
- Buyer expressly waives all other remedies at law or in equity, including actual damages, consequential damages, lost profits, and punitive damages
- Buyer waives the right to record a lis pendens
- Specific performance and termination are mutually exclusive -- buyer must elect one and cannot later switch

**Cross-reference: UNICO Seller Side (Section 13.1)** -- Provides the core seller-favorable structure: specific performance (with 60-day filing deadline) OR termination with deposit return. No cost reimbursement. No breakage fee. No damages.

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 10.3)** -- Even more aggressive: specific performance (with 20-day filing deadline) OR termination with deposit return OR waive default and close. Buyer "irrevocably waives any other right or remedy."

**Cross-reference: Seller Income Property Form (Section 11(b))** -- The most seller-favorable position in the precedent set: buyer's sole remedy is termination with deposit return plus a capped reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs ($50,000 cap). No specific performance. Buyer "expressly waives its right to specific performance, and any other damage claims."

**Cross-reference: Meadows (Section 2.4)** -- Buyer may terminate (deposit return plus capped out-of-pocket costs) OR pursue specific performance (with filing deadline). Buyer waives the right to record a lis pendens.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Eliminating or capping cost reimbursement.** Seller's ideal position is no cost reimbursement at all -- buyer gets back its deposit and nothing more. If forced to concede cost reimbursement, cap it aggressively. The Seller Income Property Form caps reimbursement at $50,000. The Meadows form references a cap in the hundreds of thousands. For a $50M+ deal, a cap of $50,000-$200,000 is appropriate. Never agree to uncapped cost reimbursement -- buyer's costs in institutional transactions can exceed $1M (legal, environmental, engineering, lender fees, rate locks, travel).
2. **Short filing deadline for specific performance.** This is a critical seller protection. If buyer is going to pursue specific performance, seller needs to know quickly so it can respond and, if appropriate, re-market the property. The Detailed Seller Side form's 20-day deadline is aggressive but defensible. The UNICO Seller Side form's 60-day deadline is more moderate. Fallback range: 20-60 days. Never agree to no deadline or a deadline exceeding 90 days. The filing deadline should be expressed as commencing upon the earlier of (a) buyer becoming aware of seller's default or (b) the scheduled closing date.
3. **Lis pendens waiver.** Require buyer to waive the right to record a lis pendens. The Meadows form includes this provision. A lis pendens clouds title and prevents seller from closing with a backup buyer, even if seller ultimately prevails on the merits. If buyer refuses to waive lis pendens entirely, negotiate that buyer may only record a lis pendens after (a) commencing a specific performance action within the contractual deadline and (b) posting a bond in the amount of the Purchase Price or a substantial percentage thereof.
4. **No damages for seller default.** The waiver of actual damages is essential. If buyer can pursue damages for seller default (lost profits, opportunity costs, price appreciation), seller's exposure is potentially unlimited. The LD framework on the buyer side is designed to create certainty; the sole-remedy limitation on seller's side serves the same function. Resist any formulation that gives buyer access to actual damages, even as a fallback.
5. **Mutual exclusivity of remedies.** Require buyer to make a binding election between specific performance and termination within a short period (e.g., 30 days after the default). Once elected, the remedy cannot be changed. This prevents buyer from filing a specific performance action, using the lis pendens as leverage, and then abandoning the action and seeking damages.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands uncapped actual damages for seller default.** This is a dealbreaker for institutional sellers. Response: the sole-remedy/election-of-remedies structure is the universal market standard for institutional CRE transactions. Actual damages are speculative, difficult to prove, and create asymmetric exposure (seller's liability is potentially unlimited while buyer's is capped at the deposit). Fallback chain: (1) No damages, no cost reimbursement; (2) No damages, cost reimbursement capped at $100K; (3) No damages, cost reimbursement capped at 0.25% of Purchase Price; (4) No damages, cost reimbursement capped at 0.5% of Purchase Price (hard ceiling).
- **Buyer demands a "willful breach" carve-out that unlocks actual damages.** This is buyer's counsel's most aggressive play. Resist strenuously. A willful breach carve-out is the single greatest threat to the sole-remedy framework because "willful" is inherently ambiguous. If forced to concede any form of willful breach carve-out, define "willful" extremely narrowly: "a deliberate conveyance of the Property by Seller to a third party in violation of this Agreement." Do not accept broad definitions such as "any deliberate act or omission." Cap damages even under the willful breach carve-out at the Earnest Money Deposit amount (creating symmetry with buyer's exposure). See Section 6 below for detailed treatment.
- **Buyer demands specific performance with no filing deadline.** Fallback chain: (1) 20-day deadline (Detailed Seller Side model); (2) 30-day deadline; (3) 45-day deadline; (4) 60-day deadline (UNICO Seller Side model). Never agree to more than 90 days. An open-ended specific performance right allows buyer to hold the property hostage indefinitely.
- **Buyer refuses to waive lis pendens.** Fallback: (1) Full waiver (Meadows model); (2) Lis pendens permitted only after filing specific performance action within contractual deadline and posting a substantial bond; (3) Lis pendens permitted only after filing specific performance action, with automatic expungement if the action is not diligently prosecuted or is dismissed.
- **Buyer demands a "Seller Breakage Fee" (UNICO Buyer Side model).** Resist entirely. The breakage fee is a buyer-side invention that effectively creates a damages remedy labeled as something else. Fallback: if forced to concede, cap the breakage fee at the lower of (a) buyer's documented actual out-of-pocket third-party costs and (b) a dollar cap not exceeding 0.5% of Purchase Price. Exclude internal costs, opportunity costs, and legal fees from the reimbursable categories.
- **Buyer demands the right to both specific performance AND damages.** This is overreaching. Specific performance makes buyer whole (it gets the property). Damages on top of that constitute double recovery. Push back firmly. Sole exception: if specific performance is awarded, buyer may recover its reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in the specific performance action (this is the prevailing-party provision, not a separate damages remedy).

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk:** Any provision that gives buyer access to uncapped actual damages for seller default. Seller's exposure is theoretically unlimited (price appreciation, lost profits, opportunity costs, consequential damages).
- **High risk:** Willful breach carve-out with broad or ambiguous definition. Creates litigation risk about whether seller's conduct was "willful."
- **High risk:** No filing deadline for specific performance. Buyer can file an action years later, clouding title indefinitely.
- **Medium risk:** Cost reimbursement without a meaningful cap. Buyer's costs in large transactions can be substantial.
- **Low risk:** Specific performance as an available remedy with an appropriate filing deadline. Specific performance is market standard and courts will enforce reasonable contractual deadlines.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office (Stabilized):** Buyer's replacement cost is relatively manageable (office properties are more fungible). Seller can more credibly resist cost reimbursement and damages.
- **Data Centers:** Buyer will argue that data center acquisitions involve uniquely high pre-closing costs (engineering studies, power assessments, connectivity reviews). Seller may need to offer a modest cost reimbursement cap but should resist strenuously any cap above $200K.
- **Industrial/Logistics:** Buyer will argue supply constraints make the asset irreplaceable. Concede specific performance (it is market standard) but hold firm on the filing deadline and no-damages position.
- **Multifamily (Large Portfolio):** Buyer's due diligence costs across a large portfolio can be substantial. Consider a slightly higher cost reimbursement cap (up to 0.5% of Purchase Price) but pair it with a tight filing deadline and full damages waiver.
- **Retail:** Anchor tenant considerations may make specific performance more complex. Standard positions apply.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** NY courts routinely grant specific performance for real property transactions. The contractual filing deadline will be enforced. NY courts generally enforce sole-remedy limitations in commercial contracts between sophisticated parties. Lis pendens is governed by CPLR Article 65 and can be cancelled on motion if the underlying action is not meritorious.
- **California:** Specific performance is a statutory right for real property (Cal. Civ. Code Section 3384 et seq.). However, contractual limitations on when the action must be commenced will be enforced. Lis pendens is governed by Cal. Code Civ. Proc. Sections 405-405.61 and can be expunged on motion.
- **Illinois:** IL courts grant specific performance freely for real property. The IL Pro-Buyer form provides broad buyer remedies; use the Detailed Seller Side form as the counter-model.
- **Oregon:** The Meadows form reflects Oregon-favorable seller drafting (lis pendens waiver, filing deadline, capped reimbursement). Oregon courts enforce contractual limitations on remedies.
- **Texas:** Texas courts treat specific performance as discretionary. Contractual provisions governing specific performance (including filing deadlines) are enforceable.
- **Colorado / Massachusetts:** The Detailed Seller Side form's 20-day filing deadline reflects aggressive but enforceable drafting under both states' laws.

## 3. Notice and Cure Periods

### Preferred Position
Seller's preferred position maximizes cure periods for seller's own defaults while keeping cure periods for buyer's defaults reasonably short (but not so short as to undermine the LD enforceability argument):

**For Seller Default:**
- Cure period of 15-30 business days after written notice from buyer specifying the nature of the default in reasonable detail
- Closing date extended by the length of the cure period
- If the default is capable of cure but cannot reasonably be cured within the initial period, seller shall have such additional time as is reasonably necessary (not to exceed an additional 30 days) provided seller is diligently pursuing the cure
- For non-monetary defaults (e.g., inability to deliver clean title, failure to obtain a required consent), seller should have the right to extend the closing date up to 60 days to effect cure
- No default shall be deemed to exist until the cure period has expired without cure

**For Buyer Default:**
- Cure period of 5 business days after written notice from seller (the UNICO model)
- Closing date extended as necessary to accommodate the cure period
- Buyer's failure to fund at closing is a monetary default subject to the 5-business-day cure period (this is adequate -- wire transfers can be re-initiated quickly)

**Cross-reference: UNICO Seller Side (Sections 13.1 and 13.2)** -- Symmetrical 5-business-day cure period for both parties. This is the minimum seller should accept for its own defaults. Push for longer.

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 10.3)** -- No express cure period for seller default (buyer may exercise remedies upon default). This is unusual and potentially problematic -- it deprives seller of any opportunity to cure even a technical or inadvertent default. Seller's counsel should add a cure period.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Asymmetric cure periods favor seller.** Push for longer cure periods for seller defaults (15+ business days) than for buyer defaults (5 business days). Rationale: seller's defaults are often related to title issues, governmental approvals, or third-party consents that take time to resolve, while buyer's defaults are typically binary (fund or don't fund).
2. **Specificity of notice requirement.** Require that the default notice identify the specific provision alleged to have been breached and the specific facts giving rise to the alleged default. A vague or conclusory notice should not trigger the cure period. This protects seller from ambush default claims.
3. **Right to adjourn closing to cure.** Seller should have an independent right to adjourn the closing for a reasonable period (15-30 days) to cure any default or condition failure, separate from and in addition to the cure period. This is addressed further in Section 7 below.
4. **What constitutes cure.** Define cure pragmatically for seller's defaults: substantial compliance, elimination of the condition giving rise to the default, or indemnification of buyer against the consequences of the default (where applicable). Strict compliance should not be required for non-monetary defaults.
5. **Automatic closing extension.** The cure period must automatically extend the closing date. Without this, a default notice delivered on the eve of closing creates an impossible timeline. Both the UNICO Seller Side and Detailed Seller Side forms include this protection.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands no cure period for seller default (immediate right to terminate or pursue specific performance).** Fallback chain: (1) 30 business days for non-monetary defaults, 10 business days for monetary defaults; (2) 15 business days for all defaults; (3) 10 business days for all defaults; (4) 5 business days (UNICO model -- this is the absolute floor).
- **Buyer demands a long cure period for buyer's defaults (15+ business days).** Push back. Buyer's most likely default is failure to fund at closing, which is binary and does not require an extended cure period. Fallback: 5 business days for monetary defaults, 10 business days for non-monetary defaults.
- **Buyer argues that seller's cure period is a "free option" to delay closing.** Response: the cure period protects both parties from the consequences of technical or inadvertent failures. A 15-business-day cure period is commercially reasonable and does not prejudice buyer (the closing date is extended, and buyer retains all rights if seller fails to cure within the period).
- **Buyer demands the right to terminate immediately upon expiration of cure period without further notice.** Accept this -- if seller has not cured within the contractual period, buyer should have the right to exercise its remedies. But insist that the initial notice must be specific and that the cure period does not begin until proper notice is given.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk:** No cure period for seller default. A single inadvertent failure (e.g., failure to deliver a required estoppel within the contractual deadline) could trigger buyer's termination right or specific performance claim.
- **Medium risk:** Symmetrical short cure periods (5 business days). Adequate for monetary defaults but potentially insufficient for title or consent-related issues.
- **Low risk:** Asymmetric cure periods (longer for seller, shorter for buyer). Commercially justified and commonly negotiated.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Data Centers:** Seller may need longer cure periods for defaults related to power contracts, interconnection agreements, or governmental permits. Push for 30 business days for non-monetary defaults.
- **Multifamily (Affordable/LIHTC):** Regulatory approval failures may require extended cure periods (45-60 days) to resolve with governmental agencies.
- **Retail:** Tenant estoppel failures are a common source of seller "default." Ensure the cure period is long enough to re-solicit estoppels from recalcitrant tenants (21-30 days).
- **Industrial:** Environmental condition issues may take time to address. Ensure the cure period accommodates environmental assessment timelines.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** NY courts strictly enforce contractual cure periods. A party that fails to cure within the period loses its right to cure. NY courts will not imply an extended cure period absent extraordinary circumstances.
- **California:** California courts may apply equitable principles to extend cure periods in some circumstances, but contractual provisions are generally controlling.
- **All Jurisdictions:** The cure period is a contractual right. Courts will enforce the period as written between sophisticated commercial parties.

## 4. Pre-Closing Breach of Seller's Representations -- Seller's Right to Cure and Update

### Preferred Position
If seller discovers before closing that any of its representations or warranties have become untrue or inaccurate, seller should have the following protections:

1. **Right to update representations.** Seller should have the express right to deliver a "bring-down certificate" or "update notice" at or before closing disclosing any changes to its representations. The update should cure seller's potential breach and prevent buyer from claiming default based on changed conditions.
2. **Buyer's remedy limited to termination if update discloses a Material Adverse Effect.** If seller's update discloses matters that constitute a Material Adverse Effect (as defined -- and the definition should be set at a high dollar threshold), buyer may terminate and receive its deposit back. Buyer should not have the right to close and then assert post-closing claims for matters disclosed in the update.
3. **Anti-sandbagging protection for seller.** If buyer proceeds to close with knowledge of a rep breach (whether from seller's update or buyer's own due diligence), buyer should be deemed to have waived any claims related to the known breach. This is the most important seller protection in the entire representations and warranties framework.
4. **No price adjustment.** Seller should not be required to adjust the purchase price for pre-closing rep breaches. Buyer's remedy is termination or waiver -- not a forced discount.

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 10.4)** -- Contains the strongest anti-sandbagging provision: buyer "expressly waives, relinquishes and releases any right or remedy" for breaches "within Purchaser's Knowledge at the time of the Closing." This is the gold standard for seller drafting.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Anti-sandbagging clause.** This is the single most important seller protection in the pre-closing breach context. Without it, buyer can close with full knowledge of a rep breach and then assert post-closing claims. The anti-sandbagging waiver should cover matters within buyer's "actual knowledge" -- not just constructive knowledge. However, "actual knowledge" should be defined broadly enough to include matters disclosed by seller in the update notice, matters discovered by buyer during due diligence, and matters that are apparent from the property's condition.
2. **Definition of Material Adverse Effect.** Set the MAE threshold high enough that routine or minor rep breaches do not trigger buyer's termination right. For a $50M deal, the MAE threshold should be no less than $500K (1% of Purchase Price). For a $100M deal, $750K-$1M is appropriate. This ensures that minor inaccuracies in tenant information, contract lists, or condition disclosures do not provide buyer with a free termination right.
3. **Seller's right to cure before buyer terminates.** If a rep breach would constitute a MAE, seller should have a cure period (10-15 business days) before buyer can exercise termination. "Cure" should include the right to indemnify buyer against the consequences of the breach (effectively making buyer whole without terminating the deal).
4. **No price adjustment mechanism.** Resist any formulation that requires seller to reduce the purchase price for pre-closing rep breaches. Price adjustments create perverse incentives for buyer to discover (or manufacture) rep breaches as a negotiating tool to reduce the price. The proper remedy structure is: terminate if the breach is material, or close and waive if it is not.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands a "pro-sandbagging" position (right to assert claims regardless of knowledge).** This is buyer's strongest play. Fallback chain: (1) Full anti-sandbagging waiver for all matters within buyer's actual knowledge (Detailed Seller Side model); (2) Anti-sandbagging waiver only for matters expressly disclosed in seller's bring-down certificate; (3) Anti-sandbagging waiver only for matters buyer discovered through its own due diligence (not matters disclosed by seller); (4) No anti-sandbagging waiver, but increase the basket amount and reduce the cap for post-closing claims.
- **Buyer demands the right to a purchase price adjustment for pre-closing breaches.** Resist. Fallback: (1) No price adjustment -- buyer's remedy is terminate or close and waive; (2) Price adjustment only for MAE breaches that seller elects not to cure; (3) Price adjustment only with seller's consent (effectively giving seller a veto).
- **Buyer demands a low MAE threshold.** Fallback chain: (1) 2% of Purchase Price; (2) 1% of Purchase Price; (3) 0.5% of Purchase Price. Hard floor: 0.25% of Purchase Price.
- **Buyer objects to seller's right to update representations.** Response: the update right prevents seller from being trapped by changed circumstances that are disclosed in good faith. Without the update right, seller would be in breach for matters that arose after signing through no fault of seller's. The update right is paired with buyer's termination right for MAE updates, which adequately protects buyer.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk:** No anti-sandbagging protection. Buyer can close with full knowledge of breaches and then assert claims, effectively obtaining a post-closing price reduction.
- **High risk:** Low MAE threshold that allows buyer to terminate for minor rep inaccuracies. This gives buyer a free "walk" right disguised as a default remedy.
- **Medium risk:** Price adjustment mechanism that creates incentives for buyer to find (or allege) rep breaches.
- **Low risk:** Reasonable update/bring-down mechanics with appropriate MAE threshold and anti-sandbagging protection.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily:** Rent roll and occupancy reps are particularly susceptible to change between signing and closing (tenant turnover, delinquencies). Seller's right to update is critical. Set the MAE threshold based on impact to projected NOI rather than absolute dollar amounts (e.g., changes affecting less than 5% of NOI are not MAE).
- **Retail:** Anchor tenant defaults or co-tenancy triggers that arise between signing and closing can significantly affect property value. Set MAE threshold with reference to anchor tenant occupancy and co-tenancy provisions.
- **Office:** Lease expiration risk and tenant creditworthiness changes should be addressed through the update mechanism.
- **Industrial:** Environmental conditions discovered between signing and closing should be addressed through the update mechanism with appropriate MAE thresholds.
- **Data Centers:** Changes in power contracts, connectivity, or regulatory compliance between signing and closing can be material. Set MAE thresholds with reference to these asset-specific factors.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** NY follows a "pro-sandbagging" default rule -- buyer's knowledge of a breach does not preclude claims absent an express contractual waiver. This makes the contractual anti-sandbagging provision essential for seller protection.
- **Delaware:** Delaware similarly follows the pro-sandbagging rule. Contractual anti-sandbagging provisions are enforceable.
- **California:** California's position is less clearly established, but the trend is toward pro-sandbagging. Contractual provisions are controlling.
- **Illinois:** No clear pro- or anti-sandbagging rule, making the contractual provision determinative.
- **All Jurisdictions:** The anti-sandbagging waiver is a contractual negotiation point. Courts will enforce the provision as written between sophisticated parties.

## 5. Cap on Seller's Post-Closing Liability

### Preferred Position
For post-closing claims arising from breaches of seller's representations and warranties, seller's aggregate liability should be tightly capped and time-limited:

- **Cap (Claim Cap):** 1% of Purchase Price. This is the standard in seller-favorable institutional forms. For a $100M deal, the cap is $1M -- enough to provide buyer with meaningful recovery for legitimate claims while limiting seller's exposure.
- **Basket (threshold):** $100,000 minimum individual or aggregate claim threshold before buyer can assert any claims. Use a "tipping basket" structure (once the threshold is exceeded, seller is liable for the full amount, not just the excess). The tipping basket, while seemingly buyer-favorable, actually protects seller by eliminating nuisance claims below the threshold.
- **Survival period:** 6 months after closing. This is the standard in the Detailed Seller Side form and is aggressive but defensible. Six months is sufficient for buyer to discover most rep breaches through normal post-closing operations.
- **Direct damages only.** Seller's liability is limited to "direct, but not consequential, incidental, indirect, punitive, special or exemplary, damages or lost profits." This language from the Detailed Seller Side form (Section 10.4) eliminates the most potentially expansive categories of damages.
- **Non-assignability of claims.** Seller's reps and warranties are "personal to Seller and Purchaser and may not be assigned to or enforced by any other Person" other than a permitted assignee of buyer. This prevents claims from being sold to litigation investors or asserted by subsequent purchasers.
- **Mitigation requirement.** Buyer must "first seek recovery under any insurance policies, Leases and Contracts prior to seeking recovery from Seller." This effectively creates a duty to exhaust other remedies before pursuing seller.
- **No recourse to seller affiliates.** Claims against seller are limited to seller's assets. No personal liability for seller's officers, directors, members, partners, managers, employees, or affiliates. Post-closing, seller's assets may be limited to the holdback escrow (if any) -- include an exculpation clause limiting recourse to seller's interest in the sale proceeds or holdback.

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 10.4)** -- The most comprehensive seller liability limitation among the precedents. 1% cap, 6-month survival, $100K basket, direct damages only, non-assignability, mitigation requirement, anti-sandbagging waiver.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Cap amount.** 1% of Purchase Price is seller's opening position and the Detailed Seller Side standard. Buyer's counsel will push for 3-5%. Defend the 1% position by arguing: (a) seller's reps are qualified by knowledge and materiality, limiting the scope of potential breaches; (b) buyer conducted extensive due diligence and had full access to the property and records; (c) the cap must be viewed in the context of the overall risk allocation, including buyer's inspection rights and the as-is nature of the transaction; (d) 1% is the institutional market standard reflected in the most widely used seller-side forms.
2. **Survival period.** 6 months is aggressive. Buyer will push for 12-18 months. Defend the 6-month position by arguing: (a) buyer will have operated the property for 6 months and will have discovered any material rep breaches through normal operations; (b) longer survival creates an overhang on seller's books that complicates seller's ability to wind up the selling entity and distribute proceeds; (c) the survival period must be viewed together with the cap and basket, which collectively provide adequate buyer protection.
3. **Basket amount.** $100K is reasonable for deals of $50M+. Buyer may push for $50K. Resist going below $75K -- a lower basket invites nuisance claims that cost more to defend than to settle.
4. **Mitigation/exhaustion requirement.** This is a powerful seller protection. Require buyer to pursue insurance, tenant indemnities, and contractor warranties before making claims against seller. Buyer will argue this is overly burdensome. Fallback: accept a "no double recovery" provision (buyer cannot recover the same loss from both seller and a third party) instead of a "must exhaust first" requirement.
5. **Exculpation/non-recourse.** Include a robust exculpation clause limiting buyer's recourse to seller's assets. Post-closing, this means the holdback (if any) and seller's remaining interest in the sale proceeds. No personal recourse to any natural person or entity affiliated with seller.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands a 3-5% cap.** Fallback chain: (1) 1% (Detailed Seller Side standard); (2) 1.5%; (3) 2% (hard ceiling for seller's fallback). Beyond 2%, the seller should demand offsetting concessions (shorter survival, higher basket, stronger anti-sandbagging).
- **Buyer demands 12-18 month survival.** Fallback chain: (1) 6 months; (2) 9 months; (3) 12 months (hard ceiling). If conceding 12 months, pair with a strong anti-sandbagging waiver and a higher basket.
- **Buyer demands a $50K basket.** Fallback: (1) $100K tipping basket; (2) $75K tipping basket; (3) $50K deductible basket (buyer only recovers amounts exceeding the basket). A deductible basket at $50K is economically equivalent to a tipping basket at a higher level.
- **Buyer demands removal of the mitigation requirement.** Fallback: (1) Full exhaustion requirement (Detailed Seller Side model); (2) Exhaustion of insurance only (no requirement to pursue tenants or contractors first); (3) No-double-recovery provision (buyer cannot recover same loss from seller and a third party).
- **Buyer demands holdback escrow.** Seller should resist holdback if possible (it ties up sale proceeds). Fallback: (1) No holdback; (2) Holdback equal to 50% of cap amount, released after survival period; (3) Holdback equal to 100% of cap amount, with periodic reductions for undisputed claims; (4) Holdback with express provision that any unclaimed holdback is released to seller at the earlier of survival expiration or resolution of all pending claims.
- **Buyer demands recourse to seller's parent/sponsor.** Resist. The selling entity is typically an SPE formed for the specific purpose of holding and disposing of the asset. The non-recourse structure is fundamental to real estate finance. Fallback: (1) No recourse; (2) Limited guaranty from parent entity for the cap amount during the survival period only; (3) "Good guy" guaranty limited to fraud and intentional misrepresentation.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk:** Uncapped post-closing liability. If there is no cap, seller faces potentially unlimited exposure for rep breaches, which could exceed the sale proceeds.
- **High risk:** Cap above 3% of Purchase Price or survival period exceeding 18 months. Creates disproportionate exposure relative to the transaction.
- **Medium risk:** Holdback escrow that ties up more than 2% of sale proceeds. Delays seller's ability to distribute and wind up.
- **Low risk:** Standard Detailed Seller Side terms (1% cap, 6-month survival, $100K basket).

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office:** 1% cap and 6-month survival are standard and defensible.
- **Multifamily:** Buyer may push for higher caps and longer survival due to the high volume of tenants and reps related to rent rolls. Seller's fallback: 1.5% cap, 9-month survival, but with a higher basket ($150K).
- **Industrial:** Environmental rep breaches can be costly. Consider a separate environmental indemnity with its own cap and survival period, carving it out from the general rep cap. This allows seller to maintain a low general cap (1%) while addressing buyer's environmental concerns separately.
- **Retail:** Tenant-related reps for anchor tenants and co-tenancy provisions may warrant a longer survival period for those specific reps (12 months) while maintaining 6-month survival for general reps.
- **Data Centers:** Buyer will push aggressively for higher caps and longer survival due to the specialized nature of the asset. Seller's fallback: 2% cap, 12-month survival, but paired with aggressive anti-sandbagging and mitigation requirements.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **All Jurisdictions:** Liability caps, baskets, survival periods, and non-recourse provisions are contractual terms that courts enforce as written between sophisticated commercial parties. There is no jurisdiction-specific override for these provisions (unlike LD provisions, which are subject to reasonableness scrutiny).
- **New York (NY Checklist):** The Practical Law checklist recommends buyer negotiate for security (holdback, LOC, guaranty) and caps between 1-10% of purchase price. Seller should use the lower end of this range (1%) as the negotiating anchor and cite it as "within the recommended range."
- **Delaware:** Delaware courts apply business judgment deference to negotiated commercial terms and will enforce caps and baskets as written.

## 6. Willful/Intentional Breach Carve-Outs -- Seller's Defense

### Preferred Position
Seller's ideal position is no willful breach carve-out whatsoever. The sole-remedy framework (Section 2 above) and the LD framework (Section 1 above) should apply to all defaults regardless of intent. Rationale:

- The LD and sole-remedy provisions are designed to create certainty of exposure for both parties. A willful breach carve-out destroys that certainty.
- "Willful" is inherently ambiguous. Virtually any default can be characterized as "willful" by an aggressive counterparty -- seller knew it was breaching (willful) vs. seller made a business judgment in difficult circumstances (not willful). The litigation over whether a breach was "willful" can be as expensive as the underlying dispute.
- The commercial real estate market functions on the assumption that default exposure is bounded. Unlimited damages for "willful" breach would change the risk calculus of every deal.

If buyer insists on a willful breach carve-out (and sophisticated buyer's counsel almost always will), seller's fallback positions should be designed to narrow the carve-out as tightly as possible.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **If a carve-out is conceded, define "willful breach" with extreme precision.** Acceptable definition: "Seller's deliberate conveyance of the Property to a third party in violation of this Agreement, other than a conveyance in connection with a foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or conveyance compelled by operation of law." This limits the carve-out to the one scenario that genuinely warrants enhanced remedies (seller sells to a higher bidder) while excluding inadvertent defaults, judgment calls, and force majeure situations.
2. **Even with a willful breach carve-out, cap damages.** If the carve-out is triggered, cap buyer's damages at the Earnest Money Deposit amount (creating economic symmetry with buyer's own capped exposure for buyer default). Alternatively, cap at 2x the Earnest Money Deposit if buyer insists on a higher number. Never agree to uncapped damages under the willful breach carve-out.
3. **Exclude consequential and punitive damages from the carve-out.** Even if the willful breach carve-out unlocks "actual damages," insist that consequential, punitive, special, and exemplary damages remain waived. The carve-out should give buyer access to direct actual damages (e.g., the difference between the contract price and fair market value) but not speculative or punitive amounts.
4. **Make the carve-out reciprocal.** If buyer insists on a willful breach carve-out for seller defaults, insist on the same carve-out for buyer defaults. Buyer's counsel will resist this (because it destroys buyer's LD protection), which provides leverage to negotiate the scope of the carve-out down.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands a broad willful breach carve-out with uncapped damages.** Fallback chain: (1) No willful breach carve-out (preferred); (2) Carve-out limited to deliberate conveyance to a third party only; (3) Carve-out for deliberate conveyance plus affirmative written repudiation of the PSA; (4) Carve-out for any deliberate default, but with damages capped at the Earnest Money Deposit; (5) Carve-out for any deliberate default with damages capped at 2x the Earnest Money Deposit and excluding consequential/punitive damages.
- **Buyer demands that the willful breach carve-out include consequential damages.** Hard no. Consequential damages in real estate transactions are speculative and potentially enormous (lost appreciation, portfolio effects, financing costs, opportunity costs). Limit the carve-out to direct actual damages.
- **Buyer argues that seller should not benefit from the sole-remedy limitation when acting in bad faith.** Response: the sole-remedy limitation is a negotiated risk allocation that both parties benefit from. Seller's exposure is bounded, and in exchange, buyer receives a certain and immediate remedy (specific performance or deposit return). If seller acts in bad faith, buyer's remedy is specific performance -- it gets the property. Additional damages on top of that are double recovery.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk:** Broad willful breach carve-out with uncapped damages and no exclusion of consequential/punitive damages. This is the single provision most likely to generate catastrophic liability for seller.
- **High risk:** Ambiguous definition of "willful" that invites litigation over seller's intent.
- **Medium risk:** Reciprocal willful breach carve-out (applies to buyer defaults too). May undermine the LD framework that protects seller.
- **Low risk:** Narrowly defined willful breach carve-out limited to conveyance to a third party with capped direct damages.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Relevant across all asset types. The willful breach carve-out is a function of deal dynamics, not asset class. In seller's markets (where seller has leverage), resist the carve-out entirely. In buyer's markets, be prepared to concede a narrow version.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **California:** Cal. Civ. Code Section 3294 permits punitive damages for fraud, oppression, or malice independent of the PSA. A contractual waiver of punitive damages is enforceable in commercial contracts, but seller must ensure the waiver is express and unambiguous.
- **New York:** NY courts may refuse to enforce LD caps for willful breaches in some circumstances, but this is not a settled rule. The safer approach is to address willful breach contractually rather than relying on (or fearing) judicial intervention.
- **All Jurisdictions:** The question of whether a contractual LD provision applies to willful breaches is jurisdiction-specific and fact-specific. Seller benefits from addressing it expressly in the PSA to avoid uncertainty.

---

## 7. Seller's Right to Adjourn Closing to Cure

### Preferred Position
Seller should have a broad right to adjourn the closing to cure title defects, condition issues, or potential defaults:

- Seller may adjourn the closing up to two times, for up to 30 days per adjournment (60 days total), to cure any identified defect, condition failure, or potential default
- Notice of adjournment need only be delivered before the then-scheduled closing date
- During the adjournment period, buyer may not terminate or exercise any default remedies
- If seller cures within the adjournment period, the closing proceeds and the adjournment is deemed not to be a default
- If seller does not cure within the total adjournment period, buyer may elect to (a) terminate and receive the deposit back, (b) waive the defect and close, or (c) pursue specific performance -- but not damages

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Number and length of adjournments.** Push for two adjournments of 30 days each (60 days total). This gives seller adequate time to address title issues, cure regulatory matters, or resolve tenant disputes that could otherwise constitute a default.
2. **Tolling of buyer's remedies during adjournment.** During the adjournment period, buyer should not be able to assert default claims or commence specific performance actions. The adjournment is a contractual right, not a default, and buyer's remedy clock should not begin to run until the adjournment expires.
3. **Scope of matters subject to adjournment.** Seller's adjournment right should cover all potential defaults and condition failures, not just title defects. If a seller rep becomes untrue between signing and closing, seller should have the right to adjourn to cure the underlying condition.
4. **No obligation to cure.** Seller should not be obligated to spend money or take action to cure. The adjournment right is an option, not an obligation. If seller elects not to cure (or cure efforts are unsuccessful), buyer's remedies are limited to the election described in Section 2 above.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands a cap of one adjournment for 15 days.** Fallback chain: (1) Two adjournments of 30 days each; (2) Two adjournments of 15 days each (30 days total); (3) One adjournment of 30 days; (4) One adjournment of 15 days (hard floor).
- **Buyer demands a firm "outside closing date" beyond which no adjournment is permitted.** Acceptable, provided the outside date is set far enough in the future (90-120 days after the original closing date) to accommodate adjournments plus extensions for other conditions.
- **Buyer demands the right to terminate during the adjournment period if seller is not diligently pursuing cure.** Resist. The adjournment is a contractual right and should not be conditioned on seller's diligence. Fallback: accept a "commercially reasonable efforts" standard for cure during the adjournment, but not a "best efforts" or "diligent pursuit" standard.
- **Buyer demands that the adjournment right not apply to willful defaults.** Acceptable -- if seller deliberately conveys to a third party (the narrowly defined willful breach), the adjournment right should not apply. But the adjournment right should apply to all non-willful defaults and condition failures.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk:** No adjournment right. Seller may be unable to resolve a curable issue before the closing date, resulting in a technical default that triggers buyer's termination or specific performance rights.
- **Low risk:** Reasonable adjournment right with appropriate limitations.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Retail:** Tenant estoppel issues are common and often require additional time to resolve. The adjournment right is particularly important for retail transactions with multiple tenants.
- **Multifamily (Affordable/LIHTC):** Regulatory approvals may require extended timelines. Consider longer adjournment periods (45-60 days per adjournment).
- **Data Centers:** Government clearances, CFIUS review, or licensing transfers may necessitate extended adjournments. Build in adequate time.
- **Industrial:** Environmental remediation or regulatory compliance issues may arise between signing and closing. Adjournment should be available for these matters.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** NY law permits reasonable adjournments in the absence of a time-is-of-the-essence provision. However, once TOE is declared, adjournment rights must be exercised before the TOE date. Ensure the PSA's adjournment right expressly overrides the TOE provision.
- **All Jurisdictions:** Adjournment rights are contractual and will be enforced as written.

## 8. Waiver of Consequential, Punitive, and Special Damages

### Preferred Position
Seller should insist on a broad, mutual waiver of consequential, punitive, special, incidental, exemplary, and indirect damages, including lost profits. The waiver should be:

- Mutual (applying to both parties' claims against each other)
- Comprehensive (covering all theories of liability -- contract, tort, strict liability, statute, common law, or otherwise)
- Unconditional (no carve-outs for willful breach, fraud, or any other theory)
- Surviving closing and termination

The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 10.4) contains the model language: liability limited to "direct, but not consequential, incidental, indirect, punitive, special or exemplary, damages or lost profits."

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **No willful breach carve-out from the damages waiver.** Buyer's counsel will push for a carve-out allowing consequential damages for willful breach. Resist. Even if a willful breach carve-out exists for the purpose of unlocking "actual damages" (see Section 6), the consequential damages waiver should remain intact. Direct actual damages for willful breach provide adequate compensation; consequential damages are speculative and potentially unlimited.
2. **Include "lost profits" in the waiver.** Lost profits are the most expansive category of consequential damages. If buyer could claim lost profits for seller default (e.g., the expected returns from operating the property over a hold period), seller's exposure would be astronomical. Ensure "lost profits" is expressly included in the waiver.
3. **Mutual waiver is more enforceable.** A one-sided waiver (seller waives claims against buyer, but buyer does not waive claims against seller) is vulnerable to challenge as unconscionable. A mutual waiver eliminates this risk and is commercially fair.
4. **Survival.** The waiver must survive closing and termination. Without express survival language, the waiver dies when the PSA terminates.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands a willful breach carve-out from the damages waiver.** Fallback chain: (1) No carve-out (preferred); (2) Carve-out only for deliberate conveyance to a third party; (3) Carve-out for willful breach but cap total damages (including consequential) at the Earnest Money Deposit; (4) Carve-out for willful breach with consequential damages uncapped but punitive damages still waived.
- **Buyer demands removal of "lost profits" from the waiver.** Fallback: (1) Lost profits waived for all purposes; (2) Lost profits waived except for third-party claims (indemnification); (3) Lost profits waived except where seller deliberately conveys to a third party.
- **Buyer argues the mutual waiver is asymmetric because seller's damages are inherently "direct" (lost sale price) while buyer's damages are inherently "consequential" (lost investment returns).** This is a sophisticated argument. Response: direct damages for buyer include the difference between contract price and fair market value at time of breach, which is the standard measure of buyer's loss. That is adequate. Lost investment returns over a multi-year hold period are inherently speculative.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk:** No consequential damages waiver. Seller's exposure for buyer's consequential damages claims could dwarf the purchase price.
- **High risk:** Waiver with broad willful breach carve-out that effectively nullifies the waiver in the most important scenarios.
- **Low risk:** Mutual, comprehensive waiver with no carve-outs.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Applicable uniformly across asset types. The consequential damages waiver is a structural provision that does not vary by asset class.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **All Jurisdictions:** Mutual consequential damages waivers in commercial contracts between sophisticated parties are enforceable. Courts may decline to enforce waivers that would insulate a party from all meaningful liability for willful misconduct, but this is rare in arm's-length commercial transactions.
- **California:** Cal. Civ. Code Section 1668 voids certain exculpatory clauses that are against public policy. However, mutual waivers of consequential damages in commercial real estate transactions between sophisticated parties are not considered exculpatory under Section 1668.

---

## 9. Dispute Resolution -- Seller's Preferred Framework

### Preferred Position
Seller's preferred dispute resolution framework includes:

- **Litigation** in a court of competent jurisdiction, with exclusive venue in seller's preferred jurisdiction (either seller's home jurisdiction or the jurisdiction where the property is located)
- **Jury trial waiver** (mutual) -- commercial real estate disputes involve complex facts and large numbers that can produce unpredictable jury outcomes
- **Prevailing party attorney fee provision** -- creates a deterrent against frivolous or overreaching buyer claims
- **No mandatory arbitration** -- litigation preserves seller's ability to seek summary judgment and to appeal unfavorable rulings, which are not available in arbitration
- **No mandatory mediation prerequisite** -- mediation requirements can delay seller's ability to resolve disputes and re-market the property

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 11.5)** -- Jury trial waiver, exclusive jurisdiction in specified courts (Colorado state court or U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado), submission to jurisdiction, waiver of inconvenient forum defense.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Venue selection.** Seller's strongest position is exclusive venue in seller's home jurisdiction. If seller is based in New York and the property is in Texas, seller may prefer NY courts (familiar counsel, sophisticated commercial bench). Fallback: venue in the jurisdiction where the property is located (this is buyer's typical counter-position and is commercially reasonable).
2. **Jury trial waiver.** This should be non-negotiable for both parties. Jury trials in commercial real estate disputes are expensive, unpredictable, and time-consuming. All institutional forms include jury trial waivers.
3. **Exclusive vs. non-exclusive jurisdiction.** Push for exclusive jurisdiction -- this prevents buyer from filing in an inconvenient or buyer-friendly forum. The Detailed Seller Side form uses exclusive jurisdiction.
4. **Service of process.** Include a consent to service of process by registered mail at the notice addresses. This eliminates procedural delay.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands venue in buyer's home jurisdiction.** This is overreaching. Fallback chain: (1) Seller's home jurisdiction; (2) Property jurisdiction (compromise); (3) Buyer's home jurisdiction with exclusive jurisdiction and jury trial waiver (last resort).
- **Buyer demands mandatory arbitration.** Resist. If forced to accept, insist on: (a) AAA or JAMS rules, (b) panel of three arbitrators with at least one having commercial real estate experience, (c) venue in seller's preferred jurisdiction, (d) reasoned written award, (e) limited discovery, (f) completion within 12 months, (g) carve-out for injunctive relief in court.
- **Buyer demands mandatory mediation before litigation.** Acceptable if: (a) mediation is non-binding, (b) mediation must be completed within 30 days of the demand, (c) the mediation requirement does not apply to specific performance claims or emergency relief, (d) failure to participate in mediation does not waive any claims.
- **Buyer resists jury trial waiver.** Push firmly. Jury trials in commercial disputes disproportionately favor the party that can present itself as the "sympathetic" party. In default disputes, that is typically the buyer (portrayed as the party that lost the deal). A judge will evaluate the contractual provisions more objectively.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk:** Venue in an unfamiliar or buyer-friendly jurisdiction. Increases litigation costs and may affect outcomes.
- **Medium risk:** Mandatory arbitration without adequate protections. Arbitrators may "split the baby" rather than enforcing the contractual provisions as written.
- **Low risk:** Mutual jury trial waiver. Universally advantageous for commercial disputes.

### Asset-Type Variations
- For multi-property portfolio deals spanning multiple jurisdictions, consider a master venue provision designating a single jurisdiction for all disputes. This prevents balkanization of disputes across multiple forums.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** The NY Commercial Division (Supreme Court, NY County) is the gold standard for commercial real estate disputes. If the property is in New York, both parties benefit from NY venue.
- **Illinois:** Cook County Circuit Court, Chancery Division, is experienced in commercial real estate matters. Good venue for Midwest properties.
- **California:** California courts are competent but can be slow. Consider specifying a department with commercial expertise.
- **Texas:** Texas courts enforce arbitration agreements robustly. If accepting arbitration in Texas, specify the applicable rules clearly.
- **Colorado / Massachusetts:** The Detailed Seller Side form specifies Colorado state court or U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, governed by Massachusetts law. This split (venue in one state, governing law in another) is unusual but enforceable.

---

## 10. Attorney Fee Shifting -- Prevailing Party Provisions

### Preferred Position
Include a broad, mutual prevailing party attorney fee provision:

- The prevailing party in any legal action, proceeding, or arbitration arising out of or related to the PSA shall recover reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, court costs, deposition costs, travel costs, and all other litigation expenses
- The provision applies at all stages: investigation, pretrial, trial, and appeal
- The court determines the "prevailing party" based on an assessment of which party's major arguments or position prevailed
- The provision survives both closing and termination

This provision benefits seller because it deters frivolous or overreaching buyer claims. If buyer knows it will be responsible for seller's attorneys' fees if it loses, buyer is less likely to pursue marginal default claims or aggressive specific performance actions.

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 11.8)** -- Comprehensive prevailing party provision covering "reasonable costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, whether at the investigative, pretrial, trial or appellate level." Prevailing party determined by court based on "which party's major arguments or position prevailed."

**Cross-reference: Seller Income Property Form (Section 15)** -- Prevailing party provision covering "court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and all other reasonable litigation expenses, including deposition costs, travel and expert witness fees."

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Broad scope.** Ensure the provision covers all disputes "arising out of or related to" the PSA. This captures not just breach of contract claims but also tort claims, fraud claims, and statutory claims related to the transaction.
2. **Definition of "prevailing party."** The Detailed Seller Side form's standard (court determines based on "major arguments or position") is workable and flexible. Avoid narrow definitions (e.g., "the party that obtains a monetary judgment") that could exclude parties that successfully defend against claims.
3. **Survival.** The provision must expressly survive closing and termination. This is when the provision is needed most -- post-closing rep breach disputes and post-termination deposit disputes.
4. **No caps.** Resist caps on recoverable fees. In complex CRE disputes, attorneys' fees can be substantial, and capping them reduces the deterrent effect.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer resists any fee-shifting provision.** The American Rule (each party bears its own fees) applies by default. Without a contractual provision, each party absorbs its own costs regardless of outcome. Push for inclusion -- it disproportionately benefits seller because buyer is more likely to be the plaintiff (asserting default or rep breach claims). Fallback: include the provision but limit it to claims arising from the default article (not the entire PSA).
- **Buyer demands a cap on recoverable fees.** Resist. Fallback: accept a cap only if it is set at a meaningful level (e.g., $500K or 1% of Purchase Price).
- **Buyer demands that fee-shifting apply only to buyer defaults.** Reject. A one-sided fee provision may be unenforceable in some jurisdictions (California's Civil Code Section 1717 makes unilateral fee provisions bilateral by operation of law). Insist on mutual application.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk:** Mutual prevailing party provision. This is standard in institutional CRE transactions and benefits both parties by deterring frivolous claims.
- **Medium risk:** No fee-shifting provision. Seller must absorb its own defense costs regardless of outcome, reducing the deterrent against frivolous buyer claims.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Applicable uniformly across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **California:** Cal. Civ. Code Section 1717 mandates that contractual attorney fee provisions be interpreted as mutual, even if drafted as one-sided. Seller benefits from this statute -- any fee provision in the PSA will be applied mutually by operation of law.
- **New York:** NY courts enforce prevailing party provisions as written. There is no statutory override for one-sided provisions, so insist on express mutual language.
- **Texas:** Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides a statutory basis for fee recovery in breach of contract actions (for the prevailing party). This supplements the contractual provision.
- **All Jurisdictions:** Fee-shifting provisions are standard in commercial contracts and are uniformly enforced.

---

## 11. Time-Is-of-the-Essence Provisions

### Preferred Position
Seller should insist on a robust time-is-of-the-essence provision that applies to all obligations and deadlines under the PSA:

- "Time is of the essence of this Agreement and all covenants and deadlines hereunder"
- The TOE provision should not be waivable by conduct -- only by express written agreement of both parties
- The TOE provision applies notwithstanding any subsequent modification or extension of any date or time period
- The TOE provision benefits seller primarily because it ensures that buyer's failure to perform on time constitutes a material breach triggering seller's right to retain the deposit as LD

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 11.14)** -- The most aggressive TOE provision: "Time is of the essence of this Agreement and all covenants and deadlines hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser and Seller hereby confirm their intention and agreement that time shall be of the essence of each and every provision of this Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent modification or extension of any date or time period... The agreement... that time is of the essence... shall not be waived or modified by any conduct of the parties, and... may only be modified or waived by the express written agreement of Purchaser and Seller."

**Cross-reference: Meadows (Section 9.10)** -- More moderate: "Subject to the express Closing extension rights included herein, time is of the essence."

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Universal application.** The TOE provision should apply to all obligations -- not just closing. This includes buyer's obligation to deliver the deposit, buyer's obligation to deliver due diligence materials, and all deadline-driven conditions. The Detailed Seller Side form's language is the strongest model.
2. **No waiver by conduct.** The anti-waiver language prevents buyer from arguing that seller's failure to object to a late performance constituted a waiver of TOE. This is critical -- without it, seller's accommodating behavior (e.g., accepting a deposit one day late) could be construed as a waiver of TOE for all purposes.
3. **Interplay with extension rights.** The TOE provision must be harmonized with any express extension or adjournment rights. The Meadows approach ("Subject to the express Closing extension rights included herein") is cleaner than the Detailed Seller Side form's approach (which could be read to override even express extension rights). Seller should use the Meadows qualification for extension rights that seller has agreed to, while maintaining the Detailed Seller Side form's aggressive anti-waiver language for all other purposes.
4. **TOE notice in New York.** In NY practice, TOE can be declared by notice even if the PSA does not contain a TOE provision, provided the noticing party gives at least 30 days' notice. If the PSA contains an express TOE provision, no additional notice is required. Including a TOE provision in the PSA eliminates the need for a separate TOE notice, which is procedurally advantageous for seller.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands removal of the TOE provision.** Resist firmly. TOE is essential for seller's protection. Without it, buyer's failure to close on time is not necessarily a material breach, and seller may need to set a new closing date and deliver formal notice before declaring a default. Fallback: accept the Meadows qualification ("subject to express extension rights") but maintain the TOE designation.
- **Buyer demands that TOE apply only to the closing date, not all obligations.** Fallback: (1) TOE for all obligations; (2) TOE for the closing date and deposit delivery, with "commercially reasonable time" for all other obligations. Hard floor: TOE must apply at least to the closing date and deposit delivery.
- **Buyer demands that seller's failure to object to a late performance waives TOE.** Reject. Include the Detailed Seller Side form's anti-waiver language ("shall not be waived or modified by any conduct of the parties").
- **Buyer argues TOE creates an inadvertent default trap (e.g., wire transfer delay).** Response: the cure period (Section 3 above) provides protection against truly inadvertent failures. The cure period and TOE work together -- TOE establishes that deadlines are firm, and the cure period provides a safety valve for good-faith failures.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk:** No TOE provision. Buyer's failure to close on time may not constitute a material breach, requiring seller to set a new date and provide formal notice before declaring a default.
- **Low risk:** TOE provision qualified by express extension rights (Meadows model). Provides clarity while preserving negotiated flexibility.

### Asset-Type Variations
- TOE is standard across all asset types. In data center transactions with complex closing deliverables, ensure that the TOE provision is harmonized with realistic closing timelines.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** TOE has particular legal significance in NY. Once TOE is in effect (either by PSA provision or by formal notice), failure to close on the designated date constitutes a material breach. The breaching party loses its right to close. NY courts require at least 30 days' notice for unilateral TOE declarations (absent a PSA provision), but an express TOE provision in the PSA eliminates the notice requirement.
- **California / Oregon / Illinois / Texas:** TOE provisions are enforced as written. The legal consequences are similar to NY -- failure to perform by the TOE date is a material breach.
- **All Jurisdictions:** Express TOE provisions eliminate the common law analysis of whether a particular deadline is an "essential" or "non-essential" term. This provides certainty and is strongly favored by seller.

## 12. Exculpation and Non-Recourse Provisions

### Preferred Position
Seller should include a robust exculpation clause limiting buyer's recourse to seller's assets and prohibiting any claims against seller's affiliates, officers, directors, members, partners, managers, employees, or agents:

- No personal liability for any natural person affiliated with seller
- No liability for seller's parent entity, managing member, general partner, or any direct or indirect owner of seller
- Buyer's sole recourse for post-closing claims is against seller's assets or, if a holdback escrow has been established, against the holdback funds
- The exculpation survives closing and termination
- The exculpation applies to claims of every nature -- contract, tort, strict liability, statutory, or otherwise

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 11.16)** -- Contains a comprehensive exculpation clause that is the market standard for institutional sellers.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Scope of protected parties.** The exculpation should cover the broadest possible universe of seller-related parties: the selling entity, its direct and indirect owners (at all levels), its officers, directors, members, partners, managers, employees, agents, representatives, advisors, and affiliates. Use a defined term ("Seller Parties" or "Exculpated Parties") to capture all of these.
2. **Fraud carve-out.** Buyer's counsel will typically demand a carve-out for fraud. This is reasonable -- the exculpation should not protect individuals who commit actual fraud. Accept a narrowly drawn fraud carve-out limited to "actual and intentional fraud" (not constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation, or breach of fiduciary duty).
3. **Post-closing recourse.** If seller is an SPE that will be dissolved after closing, buyer's practical recourse is limited. Seller benefits from this structure. If buyer insists on a holdback or guaranty (see Section 5 above), the exculpation should expressly provide that the holdback is buyer's sole source of recovery.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands recourse to seller's parent or sponsor entity.** Resist. The non-recourse structure is fundamental to real estate finance. Fallback: (1) No recourse to any affiliated party; (2) Limited guaranty from parent entity for the cap amount during the survival period only; (3) "Bad boy" guaranty limited to fraud and intentional misrepresentation by identified individuals.
- **Buyer demands a broad fraud carve-out.** Fallback: (1) Fraud carve-out limited to "actual and intentional fraud" with knowledge and reliance elements; (2) Fraud carve-out covering the selling entity only (not individual representatives); (3) Fraud carve-out subject to the cap and survival limitations.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk:** Robust exculpation with a narrow fraud carve-out. This is the institutional market standard and is rarely contested in principle (though the scope of the carve-out is negotiated).
- **Medium risk:** No exculpation clause. Buyer could assert claims against seller's affiliates or individuals, creating personal exposure for seller's principals.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Applicable uniformly. The exculpation provision is a structural element that does not vary by asset class.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **All Jurisdictions:** Non-recourse and exculpation provisions in commercial real estate contracts are enforceable between sophisticated parties. Courts will not enforce exculpation for fraud or willful misconduct, which is why a narrowly drawn fraud carve-out is advisable (it demonstrates that the exculpation was not intended to cover bad acts, strengthening the enforceability of the provision for all other purposes).

## 13. Recording Prohibition and Memorandum of Agreement

### Preferred Position
Include an express prohibition against buyer recording any memorandum, notice, or other document relating to the PSA against the property:

- Buyer shall not record or cause to be recorded any memorandum, notice of agreement, lis pendens, or other document relating to this Agreement against the Property
- Any violation of this prohibition constitutes a default entitling seller to retain the deposit as LD and terminate the Agreement
- Buyer shall indemnify seller against all costs, damages, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from any improper recording

**Cross-reference: Detailed Seller Side (Section 11.18)** -- Provides that recording a memorandum of the Agreement constitutes a default by buyer, entitling seller to retain the deposit.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Scope of prohibition.** The prohibition should cover any document that could cloud title -- memoranda of agreement, notices of interest, lis pendens, affidavits, assignments, or any other instrument. The broader the prohibition, the better for seller.
2. **Consequence of violation.** A recording violation should be treated as a default triggering the LD provision (deposit forfeiture). Additionally, seller should have the right to specific performance (i.e., to compel buyer to execute and record a release or quitclaim) and to recover actual damages incurred as a result of the cloud on title.
3. **Interplay with lis pendens waiver.** The recording prohibition complements the lis pendens waiver discussed in Section 2. Together, these provisions prevent buyer from clouding title as leverage in a dispute.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands the right to record a memorandum.** Resist entirely. A memorandum clouds title and prevents seller from closing with a backup buyer or refinancing the property. Fallback: if buyer absolutely insists (unusual in institutional transactions), limit the memorandum to specific information (description of the property and the buyer's name) and require automatic expiration upon termination of the PSA or closing.
- **Buyer argues the recording prohibition is overbroad because it prevents lis pendens.** Response: the lis pendens issue is addressed separately in Section 2. The recording prohibition addresses memoranda and notices of interest, not litigation-related filings. If buyer has a legitimate specific performance claim and files suit, the lis pendens is governed by applicable procedural rules and the contractual lis pendens waiver (if any).

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk:** No recording prohibition. Buyer could record a memorandum or other document, clouding title and preventing seller from marketing the property to backup buyers during disputes.
- **Low risk:** Recording prohibition with LD consequence. Provides a strong deterrent and immediate remedy.

### Asset-Type Variations
- Applicable uniformly across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **All Jurisdictions:** Recording prohibitions are enforceable contractual provisions. The consequence of violation (deposit forfeiture as LD) is subject to the same enforceability analysis as any other LD provision.
- **New York:** Lis pendens is governed by CPLR Article 65. A contractual waiver of lis pendens may be enforceable but is subject to judicial discretion on a case-by-case basis.
- **California:** Lis pendens is governed by Cal. Code Civ. Proc. Sections 405-405.61. Courts have the discretion to expunge lis pendens on motion, and a contractual waiver supports expungement.
