# Miscellaneous Provisions — Seller Playbook

This playbook addresses the Miscellaneous Provisions of a commercial real estate purchase and sale agreement from the **seller** perspective. It is designed for use by AI agents conducting contract review on behalf of institutional sellers disposing of income-producing commercial real estate ($50M+ transactions). The provisions covered here are frequently treated as "boilerplate," but several — particularly exculpation/limited liability and post-Closing liability limitations — are among the most economically significant provisions in the entire agreement for the seller.

## Notice Provisions

### Preferred Position

Seller should ensure the notice provision is structured so that (1) all formal notices require a reliable, verifiable delivery method — preferably overnight courier or certified mail as the primary method — with email as a supplemental (not standalone) method, and (2) notice is effective upon receipt (not upon transmission), giving Seller maximum reaction time to notices sent by Buyer. Seller should also require that copies to Seller's counsel constitute a condition to the effectiveness of any notice to Seller, creating a dual-notice safety net.

**Preferred language framework (derived from Meadows, Section 9.1):**

> All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall be properly given only if made in writing and (i) mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (ii) delivered by hand (including messenger or recognized delivery, courier or air express service), or (iii) by email; provided, however, that if such communication is given via email, an original counterpart of such communication shall concurrently be sent in the manner specified in item (ii) above. Such notices shall be effective on the date of receipt if mailed, on the date of hand delivery if hand delivered, or the date the email is sent provided the foregoing concurrent-delivery requirement is satisfied. If any notice cannot be delivered due to a change in address of which no notice was given or due to refusal to accept, such notice shall be effective on the date delivery is attempted.

Key structural elements from the seller's perspective:

- Email is permitted but **only as a supplement** to hard-copy delivery, not as a standalone method. This prevents Buyer from sending a midnight email on the last day of a cure period or diligence deadline and claiming effective notice.
- The concurrent-hard-copy requirement means Buyer cannot rely solely on email for termination notices, default notices, or title objection notices — all of which are time-sensitive actions that can materially affect Seller.
- Notice is effective upon **receipt** (not transmission), giving Seller actual knowledge before deadlines begin to run.
- Copy to Seller's counsel should be a condition of effectiveness, not merely a courtesy.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Resist any formulation that makes email a standalone, primary notice method effective upon transmission. The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 16.1) permits email as a standalone method with notice effective upon transmission — while this form is ostensibly seller-side, the email-as-standalone provision is buyer-favorable because it permits Buyer to send time-sensitive notices instantaneously without verification of receipt.
- Insist that Seller's counsel is listed as a copy recipient and that failure to deliver the copy to counsel renders the notice ineffective against Seller. This is particularly important for termination notices, default notices, and extension-election notices.
- Include the "refusal/inability" deemed-receipt provision: if notice cannot be delivered because Buyer changed its address without notifying Seller, notice is deemed received on the date of attempted delivery. This protects Seller against a Buyer that evades service.
- For the time-zone reference, use the time zone of the Property location. In portfolio transactions, designate one controlling time zone (preferably the time zone most favorable to Seller's operations, often Pacific Time for West Coast institutional sellers).
- Include Escrow Agent as a notice party but clarify that failure to deliver a copy to Escrow Agent does not invalidate the notice as between the parties.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Email should be a standalone notice method co-equal with overnight courier, effective upon transmission, because (1) institutional parties and their counsel monitor email continuously, (2) overnight courier introduces a one-Business-Day delay that can be outcome-determinative on tight deadlines, and (3) requiring concurrent hard copy is an anachronistic trap that serves no legitimate purpose.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Accept email as a standalone method, but only if notice is effective upon the sender's receipt of a delivery confirmation or read receipt — not merely upon transmission. This addresses Buyer's speed concern while preserving Seller's right to actual knowledge.
2. **Second fallback:** Accept email as standalone with notice effective upon transmission, but only for non-critical, day-to-day communications. All formal notices (termination, default, extension elections, title objections) must be sent by overnight courier, with the effective date being the date of deposit with the courier service.
3. **Third fallback:** Accept the UNICO Seller Side formulation (email effective upon transmission during business hours, next Business Day otherwise) but add a requirement that all formal notices must also be sent concurrently to Seller's counsel, with notice not effective until both the primary notice and the counsel copy are sent.
4. **Last resort:** Accept email as fully standalone but negotiate a 5:00 p.m. local-time cutoff and a one-Business-Day grace period for all time-sensitive notices — i.e., no notice shall trigger a deadline that expires on the same Business Day the notice was sent.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — From the seller's perspective, notice provisions are critical because Buyer's most powerful contractual rights (termination, title objection, default cure demands) are exercised through notices. A notice provision that permits email-only termination notices effective upon transmission at 4:59 p.m. on the last day of a cure period can deprive Seller of any meaningful opportunity to cure. The Meadows concurrent-hard-copy requirement is the strongest seller protection in the precedent set.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Data Center:** Include secure-messaging or encrypted-email protocols as acceptable notice methods if the parties use enterprise communication systems. Data center sellers are sophisticated technology operators and may prefer digital audit trails.
- **Multifamily (scattered site portfolio):** In portfolio transactions with multiple seller entities, negotiate a single notice address for all seller entities (typically the sponsor's address) rather than requiring separate notices to each entity.
- **Retail (ground lease parcels):** Where the PSA involves assignment of ground leases, verify that the PSA notice provision does not conflict with notice requirements under the ground lease. The ground lease may require notices to the ground lessor in addition to the PSA parties.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** New York courts enforce strict compliance with contractual notice provisions. A notice that fails to comply with the specified method is ineffective even if the party actually received it. This strongly supports Seller's position that the concurrent-hard-copy requirement should be a condition of effectiveness.
- **California:** California courts have been somewhat more flexible, occasionally treating actual receipt as sufficient even if the contractual method was not precisely followed. This makes the concurrent-hard-copy requirement less reliable as a defense in California.
- **Texas:** Texas courts generally enforce contractual notice provisions as drafted. Strict compliance is the norm.
- **Illinois:** Illinois courts have held that email can constitute "written notice" under commercial contracts even absent explicit authorization, which supports Buyer's argument for email-as-standalone. Include an explicit email-limitation provision to override this default.

## Confidentiality and Press Releases

### Preferred Position

Seller's primary objectives in the confidentiality provision are to (1) protect sensitive operating data (NOI, tenant financials, capital expenditure details, cap rates, rent rolls) from disclosure to competitors, tenants, or the broader market both during the transaction and after any termination, (2) prevent Buyer from using Seller's proprietary data to compete in the market or interfere with Seller's tenant relationships if the deal does not close, and (3) control the narrative around any press releases or public announcements.

**Preferred language framework (derived from UNICO Seller Side, Section 14):**

The confidentiality provision should include:

1. **Broad definition of Confidential Information** encompassing: (a) Seller's operations and businesses (leases, rent rolls, operating budgets, NOI, capital expenditure summaries), (b) the existence or pendency of the transaction, (c) the material economic terms, and (d) any other information shared by either party that is expressly designated or reasonably considered confidential. Standard carve-outs for publicly available information, previously known information, third-party-sourced information, and independently developed information.

2. **Rigorous non-disclosure standard:** Each party shall treat Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses for its own confidential information. Permitted disclosures to: (a) parties integral to the transaction (Escrow Agent, Title Company, tenants — but only to the extent necessary), (b) existing or potential investors, JV partners, lenders, and their respective officers, employees, attorneys, advisors, consultants, and Affiliates ("Permitted Recipients"), and (c) persons compelled by judicial or governmental order (with reasonable notice to the other party to seek a protective order).

3. **Requirement that Permitted Recipients be informed** of the confidential nature of the information and acknowledge their obligation to preserve confidentiality. Seller should push for a requirement that Buyer cause its Permitted Recipients to execute separate NDAs or acknowledge confidentiality obligations in writing.

4. **Survival after termination, termination upon Closing:** Per UNICO Seller Side, Section 14.4: "The parties' obligations under this Section 14 shall terminate if and when Closing occurs and otherwise shall survive any earlier termination of this Agreement for 12 months." This is the ideal seller structure — confidentiality binds Buyer for 12 months post-termination (protecting Seller's data if the deal fails) but terminates at Closing (when Buyer becomes the owner and needs unrestricted access).

5. **Supersession of Prior NDA:** Per UNICO Seller Side, Section 14.5: the Prior NDA is "deemed superseded, replaced and terminated by this Agreement." This ensures one unified set of confidentiality obligations rather than overlapping agreements.

6. **Press releases require mutual consent:** Both pre-Closing and post-Closing press releases should require mutual written consent. Seller has a strong interest in controlling the public narrative, particularly if Seller is a fund or REIT with reporting obligations and investor communications to manage.

7. **Return or destruction of materials upon termination:** If the agreement is terminated, Buyer shall promptly return or destroy (and certify destruction of) all Confidential Information and copies thereof. Buyer may retain copies only in its legal files as required by law or regulation.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Resist any formulation that makes confidentiality obligations terminate upon Closing. Post-Closing, Seller's proprietary data (historical NOI, internal budgets, capital plans, tenant negotiations) remains commercially sensitive. At minimum, negotiate that specific categories of data (tenant financial statements, internal operating budgets, pending lease negotiations) remain confidential for 12-24 months post-Closing.
- Push for a requirement that Buyer's Permitted Recipients execute separate confidentiality acknowledgments. Buyer will resist this as burdensome, but institutional sellers — particularly PE funds and REITs — routinely require it.
- Insist on mutual consent for all press releases, both pre-Closing and post-Closing. Buyer will argue it should be free to announce the acquisition post-Closing without Seller's consent. Seller's response: the announcement of Seller's disposition (price, cap rate, terms) is commercially sensitive information that can affect Seller's other pending transactions, fund valuations, and investor relations.
- Include an explicit prohibition on Buyer using Confidential Information to solicit Seller's tenants, employees, property managers, or other business relationships (a "non-solicitation" overlay on the confidentiality provision).
- Confirm that the confidentiality provision covers information shared by Seller's Affiliates, property managers, and third-party service providers, not just Seller directly.
- The income property seller form (Section 28) contains a more abbreviated formulation: "Seller and Buyer agree to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential and not make any public announcements or disclosures with respect to the subject matter hereof without the prior written consent of the other party." While concise, this does not define Confidential Information, does not address Permitted Recipients, and does not specify survival. Seller should use the more comprehensive UNICO formulation.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** (1) Confidentiality should terminate at Closing because Buyer needs unrestricted use of all property data as the new owner; (2) requiring separate NDAs from every Permitted Recipient is commercially unreasonable and will slow down the diligence and financing process; (3) post-Closing press releases should not require Seller's consent because the transaction is completed and Buyer has a legitimate business interest in announcing its acquisition.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Accept that general confidentiality obligations terminate at Closing, but carve out specific categories of Seller-proprietary data (internal NOI projections, capital expenditure budgets, tenant credit information not contained in the leases themselves) that remain confidential for 12 months post-Closing.
2. **Second fallback:** Accept that Permitted Recipients need only be "made aware of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information" and "acknowledge their responsibility to preserve confidentiality" (the UNICO standard) rather than executing separate NDAs. This is a meaningful concession but preserves Seller's ability to hold Buyer responsible for its Permitted Recipients' breaches.
3. **Third fallback:** Accept that post-Closing press releases require only "reasonable consultation" with Seller (not consent) and that neither party will disclose the purchase price, cap rate, or Seller's identity in a press release unless publicly available through recording or transfer tax records.
4. **Last resort:** Accept that post-Closing confidentiality obligations terminate entirely, but negotiate a post-termination survival period of at least 18 months (up from 12 months in the UNICO standard) to protect Seller if the deal falls apart.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — For institutional sellers, particularly PE funds and REITs, the disclosure of transaction terms (price, cap rate, per-unit or per-SF pricing) can have cascading effects on portfolio valuations, pending transactions, investor reporting, and competitor intelligence. A weak confidentiality provision that allows Buyer (or a failed buyer) to freely share Seller's operating data is a significant business risk.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily:** Marketing materials and rent comparables are commonly shared with market data services (CoStar, RealPage, Yardi Matrix). Seller should ensure the confidentiality provision does not restrict Seller's own participation in market surveys, while restricting Buyer's ability to share Seller's internal data with these services pre-Closing.
- **Data Center:** Data center transactions involve highly sensitive tenant information (customer identities, power consumption, SLA terms, interconnection details). Enhanced confidentiality protections for tenant-specific data are standard and expected.
- **Retail:** Tenant sales data is typically confidential under lease provisions. The PSA confidentiality provision should not create broader disclosure rights than the leases themselves permit.
- **Office (trophy/HQ):** High-profile office dispositions frequently attract press attention. Seller may need a specific carve-out permitting Seller to respond to media inquiries about publicly available information while maintaining confidentiality over non-public terms.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Transfer tax filings are public record in NYC, making the purchase price publicly available shortly after Closing. Confidentiality provisions regarding the purchase price are effectively moot for NYC transactions, but NOI, cap rate, and tenant data remain protectable.
- **California:** The purchase price is generally not disclosed in public recordings. Documentary transfer tax declarations are confidential in some counties. Confidentiality provisions regarding price are more meaningful in California.
- **Massachusetts:** Transfer taxes (deeds excise stamps) are public, making price confidentiality difficult to maintain.
- **Delaware (entity-level transfers):** Where the transaction is structured as an entity-level transfer, the purchase price may not appear in any public record, making confidentiality provisions particularly meaningful and enforceable.

## Brokerage Provisions

### Preferred Position

Seller should ensure that (1) each party's brokerage obligations are clearly identified and limited to the brokers they separately engaged, (2) Buyer provides a broad indemnification to Seller against any commission claims arising from Buyer's contacts, (3) Seller's obligation to pay commissions is limited to Seller's Broker under a separate agreement, and (4) no commission is payable if the transaction does not close — particularly if the failure to close is due to Buyer's default.

**Preferred language (derived from UNICO Seller Side, Section 15):**

> Each of Purchaser and Seller represents and warrants to the other that it did not employ or use any broker or finder to arrange or bring about this transaction, except for Seller's Broker and Purchaser's Broker (if any are identified above) and that there are no claims or rights for brokerage commissions or finder's fees in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising out of actions or statements by the representing party. If any person brings a claim against Seller for a commission or finder's fee based upon any contact, dealings or communication with Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Seller is not expressly responsible, then Purchaser shall defend Seller from such claim, and shall indemnify Seller and hold Seller harmless from any and all costs, damages, claims, liabilities or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by Seller with respect to the claim. [Reciprocal indemnity from Seller to Purchaser for claims based on Seller's contacts.]

**Additional protective provisions (from income property seller form, Section 31):**

> Broker shall not be entitled to any monies or other recovery realized by Seller arising out of Buyer's default. Broker shall not be entitled to any commission if Buyer or Seller elect to terminate this Agreement.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Confirm that Seller's commission obligation is exclusively under Seller's separate brokerage agreement — not under the PSA. The PSA should reference the separate agreement but not create an independent contractual obligation running to the broker.
- Include explicit language that no commission is owed if the transaction terminates for any reason. This prevents the listing broker from claiming a commission if Buyer exercises a termination right during due diligence.
- Confirm that no commission is payable from liquidated damages. If Buyer defaults and Seller retains the Deposit as liquidated damages, the broker should not be entitled to a share. The income property seller form (Section 31) expressly addresses this.
- The mutual cross-indemnification structure is critical: Buyer indemnifies Seller against claims by Buyer's brokers; Seller indemnifies Buyer against claims by Seller's brokers. Each party bears its own broker risk.
- Include a representation that there are no tail provisions, override agreements, or referral-fee arrangements that could give rise to a commission claim by a previously engaged broker.
- The brokerage indemnity should expressly survive Closing and termination.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** (1) Seller should be responsible for paying all commissions, including any cooperating commission to Buyer's broker, because the listing agreement typically provides for a cooperating split; (2) Buyer should not indemnify Seller against claims by Buyer's broker if Seller's listing agreement already provides for a cooperating commission.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Accept that Seller's listing agreement provides for a cooperating commission to Buyer's broker, but confirm that the PSA does not create any independent obligation from Seller to Buyer's broker. Buyer's broker looks solely to Seller's Broker under the cooperating arrangement.
2. **Second fallback:** Accept that Seller pays all commissions through the listing agreement, but maintain Buyer's indemnification obligation for claims by any broker other than the identified Buyer's Broker.
3. **Last resort:** If Buyer insists that its indemnification obligation is limited to brokers it "separately and independently engaged," accept this but ensure the representation that Buyer has not engaged any other broker is as broad as possible.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Commission disputes are among the most common post-Closing claims. The primary seller risk is exposure to claims by brokers the seller never engaged (procuring-cause claims, tail claims, override claims). The cross-indemnification and the no-commission-on-termination provisions are the key protections.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail (NNN):** Net lease transactions frequently involve multiple brokers (listing broker, cooperating broker, tenant-rep broker). Ensure the provision accounts for all potential claimants and that Buyer indemnifies Seller against claims by any broker contacted by Buyer.
- **Multifamily:** Multifamily transactions are frequently marketed through national platforms (CBRE MHC, Newmark, Eastdil) with pre-negotiated commission structures. Verify alignment between the PSA and the listing agreement.
- **Data Center:** Data center brokers may claim entitlement to commissions on follow-on transactions (expansions, renewals, powered-shell leasing). Ensure the brokerage provision limits commissions to the current transaction only.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Real estate brokers in New York must be licensed under the New York Real Property Law. An unlicensed broker cannot enforce a commission claim. Verify licensure of all identified brokers.
- **California:** California Business and Professions Code Section 10136 requires a written listing agreement for a broker to collect a commission. Oral brokerage agreements are unenforceable.
- **Texas:** Texas Property Code Section 62.004 requires written agreements for commission claims. No oral commission claims.
- **Illinois:** Illinois Real Estate License Act requires licensure and generally requires written agreements for commercial transactions.

## Escrow Agent Provisions

### Preferred Position

Seller's primary interests in the escrow provisions are to ensure that (1) the Deposit is held securely by a neutral, creditworthy escrow agent (typically the title company handling the transaction), (2) disbursement of the Deposit to Seller upon Buyer's default is prompt and does not require Buyer's consent or mutual instructions, (3) the escrow agent has limited liability and does not become a source of litigation that delays Seller's access to the Deposit, and (4) disputes are resolved through interpleader rather than the escrow agent making independent determinations about entitlement.

**Preferred structure (derived from PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side), Section 11.21):**

1. **Escrow agent identity:** Title company — neutral party acceptable to both sides. Seller should resist Buyer's counsel as escrow agent.
2. **Investment of Deposit:** Interest-bearing account. Interest follows the Deposit — if the Deposit is payable to Seller as liquidated damages, interest accrues to Seller's benefit (PSA form, Section 11.21(f)).
3. **Disbursement instructions:** Seller should negotiate for self-executing disbursement upon Buyer's default: if Seller delivers written certification that Buyer has defaulted and the applicable cure period has expired, escrow agent shall disburse the Deposit to Seller after a short objection period (e.g., 5 Business Days).
4. **Interpleader right:** Escrow agent may file an interpleader action if parties dispute disbursement, but Seller should negotiate that the filing of an interpleader does not delay disbursement if Seller's entitlement is clear under the agreement.
5. **Liability limitation:** Escrow agent not liable except for negligence or willful misconduct. Escrow agent may rely on written instructions and is not required to independently verify entitlement.
6. **Indemnification:** Mutual indemnification of escrow agent by both parties, unless escrow agent is negligent or guilty of willful misconduct.
7. **No implied duties:** Escrow agent undertakes only the express duties set forth in the agreement (PSA form, Section 11.21(a)).

### Key Negotiation Points

- The critical seller concern is the disbursement mechanism upon Buyer default. Avoid any formulation that requires "mutual written instructions" or "joint written direction" for all disbursements — this gives Buyer a unilateral veto over Seller's access to the liquidated damages.
- Negotiate a "notice and objection" mechanism: Seller delivers a disbursement instruction to escrow agent with a copy to Buyer. If Buyer does not deliver a written objection within 5 Business Days, escrow agent disburses to Seller. If Buyer objects, escrow agent holds the Deposit pending mutual instructions or interpleader.
- Ensure that interest on the Deposit follows the principal — if Seller retains the Deposit, Seller also receives accrued interest.
- Confirm that the escrow agent's obligations are strictly limited to those in the agreement — no implied duties, no obligation to independently investigate facts.
- The PSA form (Section 11.21(e)) permits escrow agent to consult with its own counsel with "full and complete authorization and protection in accordance with the opinion of such counsel." This is standard and should be maintained.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** (1) Disbursement should always require mutual written instructions to prevent Seller from improperly claiming the Deposit; (2) any objection mechanism should require Seller to prove default, not merely assert it; (3) interest should accrue to Buyer's benefit regardless of who ultimately receives the Deposit.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Accept mutual instruction requirement for contested disbursements, but with a mandatory (not permissive) interpleader obligation if the parties do not agree within 10 Business Days. This prevents indefinite hold-up.
2. **Second fallback:** Accept that interest follows the Deposit but only after a determination of entitlement — interest accrues to Buyer's account during the holding period, and is re-allocated to Seller only if and when the Deposit is released to Seller.
3. **Last resort:** Accept a mutual-instruction mechanism for all disbursements, but negotiate that Buyer's obligation to deliver mutual instructions is itself subject to a contractual duty of good faith — refusal to deliver instructions in the face of a clear contractual entitlement is itself a breach.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE TO HIGH** — In institutional transactions, the Deposit can be $2M-$10M+. If the deal fails due to Buyer's default, Seller's ability to promptly access the Deposit (the sole remedy for Buyer default in most forms) depends entirely on the disbursement mechanism. A "mutual instructions" requirement can trap the Deposit for months or years during litigation.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations. Escrow provisions are structural and apply uniformly across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** If the escrow agent is an attorney, IOLA (Interest on Lawyer Account) rules may apply, potentially directing interest to the NY IOLA Fund rather than the parties. Title company escrow avoids this issue.
- **California:** California escrow law (Financial Code Sections 17000-17702) regulates escrow agents. Title companies are exempt from these provisions but subject to Insurance Code oversight.
- **Texas:** No separate escrow licensing regime. Title companies routinely serve as escrow agents.
- **Colorado/Massachusetts:** Same general principles apply; title company escrow is standard.

## Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Venue

### Preferred Position

Seller should insist that the agreement is governed by the law of the state where the Property is located, without regard to conflicts-of-law principles. This is the universal standard in commercial real estate PSAs and avoids uncertainty about which state's substantive law applies to property-specific issues (title, recording, transfer taxes, landlord-tenant law, environmental liability). For jurisdiction and venue, Seller should negotiate for exclusive jurisdiction in the courts of the state where the Property is located, with Buyer irrevocably consenting to jurisdiction and waiving any objection based on inconvenient forum.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Seller Side, Section 16.8):**

> This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state in which the Property is located, without regard to any otherwise applicable principles of conflicts of laws. Venue for any action arising out of this Agreement shall be in the state courts in the state and county in which the Property is located or in U.S. Federal District Court for the applicable district in which the Property is located.

**Enhanced jurisdiction/venue clause (from PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side), Section 11.5):**

> Each of Seller and the Purchaser: (i) agrees that any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement or the subject matter hereof shall be brought only in the courts of [Property State] or the United States District Court for the [applicable] District; (ii) irrevocably submits itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts; (iii) waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue is improper or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such court; and (iv) consents to service of process by registered mail at the address to which notices are to be given if personal service is not with the exercise of reasonable efforts possible.

From the seller's perspective, the PSA form's enhanced jurisdiction clause is preferable because it (a) makes jurisdiction **exclusive** (preventing Buyer from forum-shopping), (b) includes an express waiver of inconvenient-forum defenses, and (c) consents to service by mail (simplifying service on out-of-state buyers).

### Key Negotiation Points

- Always include the "without regard to conflicts of laws" qualifier. Without it, a court could apply the choice-of-law rules of the governing state and end up applying a different state's substantive law.
- In portfolio transactions involving properties in multiple states, designate one state's law as governing the PSA, while acknowledging that local law governs title, recording, transfer taxes, and property-specific matters. Seller should designate the state with the largest asset concentration or the state where Seller has the greatest litigation convenience.
- Make jurisdiction **exclusive** rather than merely permissive. The UNICO form uses permissive venue language ("shall be in..."), while the PSA form uses exclusive submission. Seller should prefer the exclusive formulation.
- Include the waiver of inconvenient-forum objections. This prevents an out-of-state Buyer from moving to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds.
- Include consent to service of process by mail at the notice address. This is a practical protection if Buyer is a foreign or out-of-state entity.
- The PSA form specifies that the jurisdiction/venue provisions survive Closing and termination. Ensure this survival language is included.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** (1) Governing law should be property-state law (this is generally agreed), but (2) venue should not be exclusive — Buyer may want the right to file in its own home jurisdiction or in the jurisdiction where Seller's parent entity is located.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Accept non-exclusive jurisdiction (either party may file in the Property-state courts or in the other party's home state) but maintain property-state governing law. The first-filed action controls.
2. **Second fallback:** Accept that venue is permissive (rather than exclusive) in the Property-state courts, but include the waiver of inconvenient-forum objections so that neither party can challenge the Property-state venue.
3. **Last resort:** Accept non-exclusive jurisdiction without the inconvenient-forum waiver, but maintain the governing-law provision (property-state law, no conflicts principles).

### Risk Assessment

**LOW TO MODERATE** — This is generally a settled provision in institutional transactions. The risk increases in multi-state portfolio transactions where the choice of governing law can affect the interpretation of landlord-tenant provisions, environmental representations, and transfer-tax obligations.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Portfolio (multi-state):** In multi-state portfolio deals, a single governing law is applied to the PSA, with carve-outs for local law on title, recording, and property-specific matters. Seller should designate the state with the greatest asset concentration.
- **Data Center:** Data center transactions may involve regulatory considerations (CFIUS review, export controls) that implicate federal law. The governing-law clause should acknowledge the application of federal law where applicable.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** N.Y. General Obligations Law Section 5-1401 permits parties to a contract involving at least $250,000 to select New York law regardless of any connection to the state. Section 5-1402 permits consent to New York jurisdiction for contracts of $1M+. These provisions make New York a common choice for governing law in multi-state deals, even for non-New York properties.
- **Delaware:** Similar to New York, Delaware is frequently selected as governing law for entity-level transactions.
- **California:** California courts may refuse to enforce a choice-of-law provision if California has a materially greater interest in the transaction. For California properties, always use California law.
- **Colorado:** The PSA form (Section 11.5) specifies Colorado courts and Colorado substantive law for a Colorado property — this is the standard and should not be controversial.

## Jury Trial Waiver

### Preferred Position

Seller should include a mutual, broad jury trial waiver covering all claims arising under or related to the agreement. This benefits Seller because (1) juries may be more sympathetic to buyers (particularly in disputes involving perceived seller non-disclosure or misrepresentation), (2) bench trials are faster and more predictable, and (3) institutional parties and their counsel are better served by judge-decided fact-finding.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Seller Side, Section 16.9):**

> EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO OR THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY.

Key elements:

- ALL CAPS formatting (required in some jurisdictions for enforceability).
- Broad scope covering contract, tort, and all related instruments and transactions.
- Acknowledgment that the provision was negotiated at arm's length with benefit of counsel.
- The PSA form (Section 11.5) includes the jury waiver within the governing law section and adds: "EACH PARTY HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING." Both formulations are acceptable.

### Key Negotiation Points

- This is typically a non-controversial provision. Both institutional sellers and buyers benefit from bench trials.
- Ensure the waiver covers claims "in any way connected with or related or incidental to" the agreement — not just claims "arising under" the agreement. The broader formulation prevents Buyer from circumventing the waiver by characterizing a claim as a tort (fraud, negligent misrepresentation) rather than a contract dispute.
- Include the acknowledgment that both parties had the benefit of counsel. This is important for enforceability.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Pushback on this provision is rare in institutional transactions. If a counterparty resists, it may indicate unsophisticated counsel or a litigious posture — either is a red flag that may warrant heightened scrutiny of other provisions.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Standard provision. The primary risk is omission rather than adverse drafting.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **California:** Jury trial waivers in pre-dispute agreements are **unenforceable** in California under California Constitution Article I, Section 16, and *Grafton Partners v. Superior Court* (2005). For California properties, this provision will not be enforced. **Seller should substitute a judicial reference provision** under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 638, which provides for a referee to try all issues of fact and law, achieving a similar result to a bench trial.
- **Georgia:** Georgia courts have been reluctant to enforce pre-dispute jury trial waivers. Use caution.
- **New York:** Enforceable if knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made. The acknowledgment language supports enforceability.
- **Texas:** Generally enforceable in commercial transactions between sophisticated parties.
- **Federal courts:** Enforceable in most federal circuits for commercial transactions.

## Entire Agreement / Merger Clause

### Preferred Position

Seller should insist on a comprehensive merger clause that supersedes all prior agreements, discussions, understandings, and representations — including any LOI, early access agreement, NDA, marketing materials, offering memorandum, and oral promises. This protects Seller against Buyer's claims that Seller made oral representations or promises outside the four corners of the PSA.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Seller Side, Section 16.16):**

> This Agreement (including any and all exhibits and/or schedules attached hereto) and any other document to be furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof embody the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto as to the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings other than those expressly set forth or referred to in such documents. This Agreement and such documents supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the parties and/or their affiliates with respect to the subject matter hereof (including, without limitation, any previously executed letters of intent, early access agreements and/or non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements).

### Key Negotiation Points

- Expressly enumerate the types of prior agreements being superseded: LOIs, NDAs, early access agreements, term sheets, offering memoranda, and any oral representations. The UNICO form includes this enumeration.
- Include the express statement that "there are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings other than those expressly set forth" — this is a powerful shield against Buyer's claims of extra-contractual representations.
- Reference "exhibits and schedules" so the attached forms are part of the integrated agreement.
- Verify consistency with the confidentiality provision. If the confidentiality section supersedes the prior NDA (UNICO Seller Side, Section 14.5), the merger clause should not independently terminate the NDA's obligations without the replacement confidentiality terms in the PSA taking effect.
- The PSA form (Section 11.1) uses a more concise formulation. The UNICO version is more protective because it enumerates superseded documents and expressly disclaims extra-contractual representations.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

This is generally non-controversial. If Buyer resists inclusion of specific superseded documents (e.g., wants the NDA to survive), negotiate within the confidentiality provision rather than weakening the merger clause. The merger clause itself should be as comprehensive as possible.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Standard boilerplate. The risk is primarily in omission or in failing to enumerate specific prior agreements that should be superseded, particularly the offering memorandum — Seller must ensure that any representations in the OM are not independently actionable.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** N.Y. General Obligations Law Section 15-301 provides that a properly drafted merger clause prevents a party from introducing extrinsic evidence to vary the terms of the written agreement. This is one of the strongest statutory backstops for merger clauses in the country.
- **California:** California courts apply the parol evidence rule (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. Section 1856) but may still consider extrinsic evidence to determine the meaning of ambiguous terms, even in the presence of a merger clause.

## Amendments (Written Only)

### Preferred Position

All amendments, modifications, and supplements must be in writing, signed by both parties, and must expressly state that they are intended to amend the agreement. No oral modifications, no modifications by course of conduct, no modifications by email exchange.

**Preferred language (from PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side), Section 11.10):**

> This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by a written agreement signed by both Seller and Purchaser that expressly states that it is intended to amend this Agreement.

The "expressly states" qualifier is the strongest formulation in the precedent set and is preferred by Seller because it prevents Buyer from arguing that an informal email exchange, side letter, or closing instruction constitutes an amendment.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Adopt the PSA form's "expressly states" requirement. The UNICO form (Section 16.19) omits this qualifier — Seller should add it.
- Confirm that the amendment provision does not conflict with the notice provision — email notice is valid for contractual notices but is not sufficient for amendments.
- Ensure this provision works in conjunction with the no-waiver clause to prevent any argument that Seller's conduct (e.g., accepting late performance, waiving a condition) constitutes an implied amendment.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

This is universally accepted boilerplate. No pushback expected.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Standard provision.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- All U.S. jurisdictions enforce written-amendment provisions for commercial real estate contracts.
- **New York:** Strongly enforceable under N.Y. General Obligations Law Section 15-301.

## No Recording of Agreement

### Preferred Position

Seller must include an aggressive no-recording provision that (1) prohibits Buyer from recording any memorandum, notice, or other document disclosing the agreement, (2) makes a violation a material default entitling Seller to terminate and retain the Deposit as liquidated damages, and (3) grants Seller an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and record documents removing any wrongful recording. This is one of the most important seller protections in the miscellaneous provisions because a recorded memorandum creates a title cloud that can prevent Seller from marketing the property to a backup buyer if the deal fails.

**Preferred language (from PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side), Section 11.18):**

> The provisions hereof shall not constitute a lien on the Property. Neither Purchaser nor its agents or representatives shall record or file this Agreement or any notice or memorandum hereof in any public records. If Purchaser breaches the foregoing provision, this Agreement shall, at Seller's election, terminate, and Seller shall retain the Deposit in accordance with Section [Buyer Default/Liquidated Damages]. Purchaser hereby irrevocably appoints Seller as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, coupled with an interest, for the purpose of executing and recording such documents and performing such other acts as may be necessary to terminate any recording or filing of this Agreement or any notice or memorandum hereof in violation of this provision. The provisions of this Section shall survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The three-part remedy (termination right + Deposit forfeiture + power of attorney) is the gold standard for sellers. The UNICO form (Section 16.11) contains only a simple prohibition ("Purchaser shall not record any memorandum disclosing this Agreement") without remedies — this is inadequate from the seller's perspective.
- The power of attorney is "coupled with an interest" (Seller's interest in maintaining clear title), which means it is irrevocable by Buyer even after termination.
- The provision should survive Closing and termination so Seller can remove any wrongful recording even after the transaction ends.
- Include "agents or representatives" in the prohibition to prevent Buyer's broker or counsel from recording a memorandum on Buyer's behalf.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** (1) The power of attorney is overreaching and could be abused; (2) the Deposit-forfeiture remedy is disproportionate to the harm of a recording; (3) Buyer should have a cure right before Seller can exercise termination and forfeiture.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Maintain the power of attorney and termination right but add a cure period — Buyer must remove the recording within 3 Business Days of Seller's notice before Seller can terminate and retain the Deposit.
2. **Second fallback:** Maintain the power of attorney but remove the automatic Deposit forfeiture. Instead, treat the wrongful recording as a default subject to the standard default and cure provisions.
3. **Last resort:** Remove the power of attorney but maintain the prohibition, the termination right, and the Deposit forfeiture. Seller would need to seek a court order to remove the recording.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — A recorded memorandum of contract creates a cloud on Seller's title that can persist for months or years, preventing Seller from selling the property to another buyer. In a declining market or with a defaulting buyer, this is a devastating practical impediment. The power-of-attorney remedy is the only self-help mechanism available to Seller.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- All jurisdictions permit recording of memoranda of contract. The contractual no-recording provision waives this right.
- **New York:** Lis pendens (CPLR 6501) is available to Buyer as an alternative to a memorandum of contract, but only in the context of pending litigation. The no-recording provision should not be construed to waive Buyer's right to file a lis pendens in a bona fide specific performance action.
- **California:** A power of attorney to remove a recorded document is enforceable but may require a quiet-title action if the county recorder will not accept it.

---

## Time of the Essence

### Preferred Position

Seller should include an aggressive, comprehensive time-of-the-essence clause that applies to every provision of the agreement, cannot be waived except by express written agreement, and is not waived by course of conduct (e.g., accepting late performance). This is critical because Seller's most important contractual rights — Deposit forfeiture upon Buyer's default, termination rights, cure deadlines — depend on strict enforcement of deadlines.

**Preferred language (from PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side), Section 11.14):**

> Time is of the essence of this Agreement and all covenants and deadlines hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser and Seller hereby confirm their intention and agreement that time shall be of the essence of each and every provision of this Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent modification or extension of any date or time period that is provided for under this Agreement. The agreement of Purchaser and Seller that time is of the essence of each and every provision of this Agreement shall not be waived or modified by any conduct of the parties, and the agreement of Purchaser and Seller that time is of the essence of each and every provision of this Agreement may only be modified or waived by the express written agreement of Purchaser and Seller that time shall not be of the essence with respect to a particular date or time period, or any modification or extension thereof, which is provided under this Agreement.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The PSA form's "super-charged" formulation is the strongest seller position in the precedent set. It (a) applies to every provision, not just the Closing date, (b) survives modifications and extensions, and (c) cannot be waived by course of conduct — only by express written agreement.
- This provision works in conjunction with the no-waiver clause and the written-amendment requirement to prevent Buyer from arguing that Seller's acceptance of late performance constituted a waiver of time-of-the-essence.
- The income property seller form (Section 24) uses the simpler "Time is of the essence" — while this is adequate, the PSA form's expanded language provides significantly greater protection against waiver arguments.
- Ensure the time-computation rules (exclude first day, include last day, extend to next Business Day if last day is a non-Business Day) are included in the same section or cross-referenced.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The "super-charged" formulation eliminates equitable defenses (waiver, estoppel) that should be available if Seller has accepted late performance or otherwise acquiesced to delays.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Maintain the comprehensive time-of-the-essence clause but accept that the "no waiver by conduct" language applies only prospectively — i.e., acceptance of late performance on one occasion does not waive the time requirement for future performance, but the specific late performance that was accepted is deemed waived.
2. **Second fallback:** Accept the simple "time is of the essence" formulation (UNICO/income property style) but ensure the no-waiver clause provides independent protection against arguments of waiver by conduct.
3. **Last resort:** Accept the simple formulation and rely on adequate cure periods in the default provision to provide Buyer with the flexibility it needs, while Seller retains the general time-of-the-essence protection.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE TO HIGH** — The interaction between time-of-the-essence and Buyer's default provisions is critical for Seller. If Buyer fails to close on the scheduled Closing date, Seller's right to retain the Deposit depends on the time-of-the-essence clause making the Closing date a drop-dead deadline. Without it, Buyer may argue that the failure to close on the exact date is not a material breach.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** New York courts strictly enforce time-of-the-essence clauses. A party that fails to perform on a time-of-the-essence date is in material breach, and the other party may terminate without further notice. This is the most favorable jurisdiction for sellers on this issue.
- **California:** California courts are somewhat more willing to consider equitable defenses (waiver, estoppel) even in the presence of a time-of-the-essence clause. The "super-charged" formulation is particularly important in California to rebut these equitable arguments.
- **Texas:** Texas courts enforce time-of-the-essence clauses as drafted but will consider the totality of the circumstances.

## Severability

### Preferred Position

Standard severability clause providing that if any provision is found invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect. Seller should ensure the clause includes a "reformation" concept — the invalid provision should be given effect to the fullest possible extent consistent with applicable law, rather than being struck entirely.

**Preferred language (from PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side), Section 11.17):**

> The parties hereto intend and believe that each provision in this Agreement comports with all applicable local, state and federal laws and judicial decisions. If, however, any provision in this Agreement is found by a court of law to be in violation of any applicable local, state, or federal law, statute, ordinance, administrative or judicial decision, or public policy, or if in any other respect such a court declares any such provision to be illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable as written, then it is the intent of all parties hereto that, consistent with and with a view towards preserving the economic and legal arrangements among the parties hereto as expressed in this Agreement, such provision shall be given force and effect to the fullest possible extent, and that the remainder of this Agreement shall be construed as if such illegal, invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable provision were not contained herein, and that the rights, obligations, and interests of the parties under the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

The reformation concept ("given force and effect to the fullest possible extent") is important for Seller because it prevents a court from striking an entire provision (e.g., the exculpation clause) rather than narrowing it to the maximum enforceable scope.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Include the "as to such jurisdiction" qualifier for multi-jurisdictional portfolio transactions, so that a ruling in one state does not affect the provision's enforceability in another.
- The reformation concept is particularly important for the exculpation, limited-liability, and jury-trial-waiver provisions, which may be challenged in certain jurisdictions.
- Standard boilerplate — minimal negotiation expected.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

No material pushback expected. This is universally accepted boilerplate.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Standard provision.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Universally enforced across U.S. jurisdictions.

---

## Further Assurances

### Preferred Position

Include a mutual obligation for each party to execute and deliver additional documents reasonably necessary to accomplish the intent of the agreement. From the seller's perspective, this is important for post-Closing cooperation — Buyer may need to execute documents (estoppel responses, consent letters, tax-appeal cooperation) that Seller requires to complete wind-down of the selling entity, satisfy fund-level obligations, or cooperate with Seller's tax advisors.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Seller Side, Section 16.20):**

> Each party, at the request of the other, shall execute, acknowledge or have notarized (if appropriate) and deliver in a timely manner such additional documents, and do such other additional acts, also in a timely manner, as may be reasonably required in order to accomplish the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the obligation survives Closing. This is important for Seller's post-Closing needs (tax appeals, audit cooperation, proration true-ups, corrective instruments).
- The Meadows form (Section 9.6) makes the obligation effective "from and after the Effective Date," confirming it applies both pre- and post-Closing.
- Add a cost-allocation provision: the requesting party bears the cost of preparation and execution. The executing party should not be required to incur material out-of-pocket costs.
- Ensure the obligation is limited to actions "consistent with the provisions of this Agreement" (UNICO language) so that the further-assurances obligation cannot be used to expand either party's substantive obligations.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Minimal pushback expected. Buyer may request that the obligation be limited to actions that do not impose material additional liability or cost — this is a reasonable limitation.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Standard provision, but its absence can create complications when post-Closing corrective documents or tax-appeal cooperation is needed.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Portfolio transactions:** Further-assurances obligations are particularly important when conveying multiple properties through multiple deeds and assignments, where post-Closing corrective instruments are more common.
- **Data Center:** May require post-Closing cooperation for utility transfer applications, interconnection agreements, and regulatory filings.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Universally enforceable. Some jurisdictions (e.g., California) have statutory further-assurances obligations for real property conveyances.

## Counterparts and Electronic Signatures

### Preferred Position

The agreement should be executable in counterparts with electronic signatures (including DocuSign, AdobeSign, and PDF/email signatures) having the same legal effect as original ink signatures. This is standard in modern institutional transactions and benefits Seller by enabling rapid execution, particularly when multiple signatories are involved.

**Preferred language (synthesized from UNICO Seller Side, Section 16.22, and Meadows, Section 9.10):**

> This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute the same agreement, whether or not all parties execute each counterpart. The words "execution," "signed" and "signature" and words of like import shall include images of manually executed signatures transmitted by electronic format (including ".pdf", ".tif" or ".jpg") and other electronic signatures (including DocuSign and AdobeSign). The use of electronic signatures and electronic records shall be of the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a manually executed signature to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, any state law based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, and the Uniform Commercial Code.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the electronic signature provision references both federal (E-SIGN Act) and state (UETA) electronic signature laws.
- Confirm that the provision covers the PSA itself and all "instruments, documents or agreements executed or delivered in connection herewith."
- The PSA form (Section 11.20) includes a reciprocal obligation to deliver originals "promptly" after electronic execution "but a failure to do so shall not affect the enforceability." This is a helpful clarification.
- Ensure that the closing deliverables section does not require original "wet" signatures on documents that will be electronically executed.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

No material pushback expected. Electronic signatures are universally accepted in institutional commercial real estate.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Standard provision.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- All 50 U.S. states have adopted some version of the UETA or equivalent legislation permitting electronic signatures in commercial transactions.
- **New York:** The Electronic Signatures and Records Act (ESRA) governs. Enforceable for commercial real estate.
- **Illinois:** Illinois Electronic Commerce Security Act provides an additional framework.
- Note: Certain documents delivered at Closing (deeds, transfer tax returns, affidavits) may require notarization. Remote online notarization (RON) is now permitted in the majority of U.S. states but check state-specific rules for the Property jurisdiction.

---

## No Third-Party Beneficiaries

### Preferred Position

The agreement should expressly disclaim any intent to benefit third parties or create third-party beneficiary rights. This is particularly important for Seller because it prevents tenants, brokers, lenders, and other persons from asserting rights under the PSA.

**Standard language (from UNICO Seller Side, Section 16.14):**

> Nothing in this Agreement is intended to benefit any third party or create any third party beneficiary.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure this provision does not conflict with any indemnification obligations that may extend benefits to Seller's Affiliates, members, or managers (the exculpation provision protects these persons, but they should not be deemed third-party beneficiaries of the PSA as a whole).
- Verify that the provision does not inadvertently negate the rights of assignees or successors, which should be addressed separately in the assignment and successors-and-assigns provisions.
- Confirm that the brokerage provision's indemnification obligations are enforceable notwithstanding the no-third-party-beneficiaries clause — brokers should not be able to claim third-party beneficiary status, but the cross-indemnification between the parties should be enforceable.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

No pushback expected. This is universally accepted boilerplate.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Standard provision.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Universally enforceable.

---

## Construction / Interpretation (No Rule of Construction Against Drafter)

### Preferred Position

Include a mutual acknowledgment that both parties contributed to drafting the agreement and that ambiguities will not be construed against either party. This is critical when Seller provides the initial draft form, because without this clause, the contra proferentem rule would resolve all ambiguities against Seller as the drafter.

**Preferred language (from PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side), Section 11.15):**

> This Agreement shall not be construed more strictly against one party than against the other merely by virtue of the fact that it may have been prepared primarily by counsel for one of the parties, it being recognized that both Purchaser and Seller have contributed substantially and materially to the preparation of this Agreement.

**Additional interpretive provisions (from Meadows, Section 9.5):**

> The defined terms in this Agreement shall apply equally to both the singular and the plural forms. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. The term "person" includes individuals, corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, trusts, other legal entities, organizations and associations, and any government or governmental agency or authority. The words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation." The words "approval," "consent" and "notice" shall be deemed to be preceded by the word "written."

### Key Negotiation Points

- This is essential on a seller-drafted form. Without it, Buyer benefits from the contra proferentem rule, and every ambiguity in Seller's form is resolved against Seller.
- Include the Meadows-style interpretive rules (singular/plural, "including" means "without limitation," "approval/consent/notice" means "written"). These prevent disputes over basic drafting conventions.
- Particularly important for the exculpation and limited-liability provisions, which Seller drafts and which courts may be inclined to construe narrowly against the drafter absent this clause.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Minimal pushback expected. Buyer may note that by accepting this clause, it gives up the contra proferentem advantage — but in institutional transactions with negotiated documents, the clause is standard.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Standard provision, but strategically important for Seller because Seller typically provides the initial form.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Universally applied and enforced. The contra proferentem rule is a common-law default that parties can contractually waive.

---

## Exculpation / Limited Liability (No Personal Liability of Members/Officers)

### Preferred Position

**This is the single most important miscellaneous provision for Seller.** The exculpation clause eliminates personal liability of Seller's constituent members, managers, partners, officers, directors, employees, and agents, and limits Buyer's recourse exclusively to Seller's assets (which, for a single-purpose entity, may be limited to the Property itself pre-Closing and the net sale proceeds post-Closing). Seller must ensure this provision is airtight, broadly drafted, and survives both Closing and termination.

**Preferred language (synthesized from PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side), Section 11.16, and Meadows, Section 9.11):**

> (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and subject to any additional limitations on Seller's liability set forth elsewhere in this Agreement: (i) Purchaser's recourse against Seller under this Agreement or any agreement, document, certificate or instrument delivered by Seller hereunder, or under any law, rule or regulation relating to the Property, shall be limited to Seller's interest in the Property (or, following the Closing, to the net proceeds of the sale of the Property actually received by Seller); and (ii) in no event shall any of Seller's direct or indirect members, managers, partners, shareholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, or any other person or entity having a direct or indirect ownership interest in Seller (collectively, "Seller Parties") have any personal liability under this Agreement, in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, or under any document delivered in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Section, no negative capital account or any contribution or payment obligation of any partner or member of Seller shall constitute an asset of Seller.
>
> (b) No constituent shareholder, member or partner in or agent of Seller, nor any partnership, limited liability company, corporation, trust or other entity that has or acquires a direct or indirect interest in Seller, shall have any personal liability, directly or indirectly, under or in connection with this Agreement or any agreement made or entered into under or pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, or any amendment or amendments to any of the foregoing made at any time or times. Purchaser and its successors and assigns and, without limitation, all other persons, shall look solely to Seller's assets for the payment of any claim or for any performance, and Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby waives any and all such personal liability.
>
> (c) The provisions of this Section shall survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement.

Key elements from the seller's perspective:

- **Look-to-entity-only:** Buyer looks solely to Seller's assets — not to the assets of any Seller Party.
- **No capital-account clawback:** Negative capital accounts and contribution obligations of members/partners are explicitly excluded from Seller's assets. This prevents Buyer from arguing it can reach through the entity.
- **Waiver of personal liability:** Buyer expressly waives any personal liability of Seller Parties on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns.
- **Broad definition of protected persons:** Members, managers, partners, shareholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, and any entity with a direct or indirect interest in Seller.
- **Survival:** The provision survives Closing and termination.
- **Acceptance of deed as full performance:** The PSA form (Section 11.16(a)) adds: "The acceptance of the Deed shall constitute full performance of all of Seller's obligations hereunder other than those obligations of Seller that by the express terms hereof survive the Closing." This is an additional limitation that merges most pre-Closing obligations into the deed delivery.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The exculpation provision should be as broad as possible, covering not just the PSA but "any agreement, document, certificate or instrument delivered by Seller hereunder, or under any law, rule or regulation relating to the Property." This prevents Buyer from suing Seller Parties under tort theories or statutory claims.
- Include the express waiver from Buyer ("Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby waives any and all such personal liability"). The Meadows form (Section 9.11) includes this waiver, which makes it an affirmative release rather than merely a limitation.
- The "no negative capital account" language is critical for PE fund sellers where the SPE may have zero or negative equity after distributing sale proceeds. Without this language, Buyer could argue that the members' unfunded capital commitments constitute Seller assets.
- Ensure the provision covers "any law, rule or regulation relating to the Property" — not just contractual claims. This is important because environmental claims, ADA claims, and other statutory claims could otherwise be pursued against Seller Parties personally.
- The "acceptance of the Deed" merger language further limits Seller's exposure by treating deed acceptance as full performance of pre-Closing obligations (subject to express surviving obligations).
- Include the provision in the PSA itself (not just in a closing certificate or side letter). The PSA is the primary contract, and the exculpation must be part of the agreement that Buyer signs.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** (1) The look-to-entity-only provision makes post-Closing remedies meaningless if Seller distributes all proceeds to its members immediately after Closing; (2) the no-capital-account-clawback language eliminates any recourse against Seller after the proceeds are distributed; (3) the waiver of personal liability is too broad and could shield fraud; (4) Buyer needs a holdback, escrow, or guaranty to ensure a source of recovery.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Maintain the full exculpation but agree to a post-Closing escrow holdback (typically 1-3% of the Purchase Price, held for 6-12 months) to secure Seller's post-Closing indemnification obligations (rep-and-warranty breaches, proration true-ups). The holdback is the sole source of recovery, and upon its release, Seller has no further liability. This is the most common institutional compromise and should be Seller's first offer if Buyer objects to the bare exculpation.
2. **Second fallback:** Maintain the full exculpation but agree to a no-dissolution covenant — Seller will not dissolve or distribute all proceeds for the duration of the rep-and-warranty survival period (typically 6-12 months). This gives Buyer a theoretical source of recovery without requiring a holdback.
3. **Third fallback:** Maintain the exculpation for personal liability of individuals, but accept a limited guaranty from Seller's parent entity or fund-level entity covering only (a) post-Closing indemnification obligations up to the claim cap, and (b) proration true-ups. The guaranty expires upon expiration of the rep-and-warranty survival period.
4. **Fourth fallback:** Accept a carve-out from the exculpation for fraud. Buyer's recourse against Seller Parties for actual, intentional fraud is not limited by the exculpation provision. This is a narrow carve-out that should be acceptable because institutional sellers do not commit fraud.
5. **Last resort:** If Buyer insists on broader recourse, negotiate a higher claim cap or longer survival period in exchange for maintaining the full exculpation. The trade-off is: Seller accepts greater dollar exposure in exchange for preserving the structural protection of the look-to-entity-only limitation.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — This is the most important provision in the miscellaneous section for Seller. The exculpation clause is the structural foundation that protects Seller's principals, investors, and fund from personal liability. Any weakness in this provision — any carve-out, any ambiguity, any failure to cover statutory claims — can expose Seller's individual members and managers to personal lawsuits. The financial stakes are enormous: in a $50M+ transaction, even a 1% claim cap represents $500,000+ in potential personal exposure if the exculpation is breached.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The concern is structural, not asset-type specific. However, the magnitude of post-Closing risk varies by asset type and affects Buyer's willingness to accept the bare exculpation:
  - **Office and Retail (multi-tenant):** Higher proration-adjustment and tenant-reconciliation risk. Buyer may push harder for a holdback or guaranty.
  - **Industrial (NNN):** Lower post-Closing adjustment risk. Buyer may accept the bare exculpation more readily.
  - **Multifamily:** Operating expense reconciliations, security deposit obligations, and tenant-turnover liabilities create post-Closing exposure. Holdback is common.
  - **Data Center:** Complex tenant relationships, infrastructure warranties, and equipment-transfer obligations may generate post-Closing claims. Holdback or guaranty may be expected.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Delaware:** Most institutional SPEs are formed in Delaware. Delaware LLC Act Section 18-303 provides broad statutory protection against member liability, which the contractual exculpation reinforces. Delaware is the most favorable jurisdiction for entity-level liability protection.
- **New York:** New York courts will enforce contractual exculpation provisions but may permit piercing-the-veil claims in cases of fraud. The fraud carve-out (Fallback #4) anticipates this risk.
- **California:** California courts are somewhat more aggressive about piercing the corporate/LLC veil, particularly where the entity is undercapitalized. The exculpation provision should be supplemented by ensuring the SPE is adequately capitalized and observes entity formalities through the rep-and-warranty survival period.
- **Texas:** Texas Business Organizations Code provides similar SPE protections to Delaware. Contractual exculpation is enforceable.

---

## Joint and Several Liability

### Preferred Position

Where there are multiple Seller entities (portfolio transactions, TIC structures), Seller should resist joint-and-several liability and instead insist on several (proportionate) liability based on each entity's ownership interest or allocated portion of the Purchase Price. Each Seller entity should be liable only for representations and obligations relating to the specific property it owns — not for a co-seller's breaches.

Where there are multiple Buyer entities, Seller should insist on joint-and-several liability so that Seller can pursue any Buyer entity for any obligation under the agreement.

### Key Negotiation Points

- In portfolio transactions with multiple Seller entities, resist joint-and-several liability. Each SPE is formed to hold a single asset and should not be cross-liable for another SPE's obligations. Joint-and-several liability of co-sellers would defeat the purpose of the SPE structure.
- If Buyer assigns the agreement to an Affiliate, insist that the original Buyer remains jointly and severally liable with the assignee. Per UNICO Seller Side, Section 16.6: "No assignment by Purchaser shall release it from any liability hereunder." This ensures Seller has recourse against the creditworthy original Buyer, not just a newly formed, thinly capitalized acquisition entity.
- Per the PSA form (Section 11.3), require that any assignee "assume all of Purchaser's obligations hereunder in a manner reasonably acceptable to Seller and become jointly and severally liable with Purchaser for all such obligations."
- In TIC transactions where Buyer is acquiring through a tenancy-in-common structure, insist on joint-and-several liability of all TIC co-buyers for all obligations under the agreement.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** (1) Joint-and-several liability of multiple Buyer entities is unfair if each entity is acquiring a proportionate interest; (2) the original Buyer's liability should terminate upon assignment to a controlled Affiliate that assumes all obligations.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Accept proportionate (several) liability of co-buyers, but only if each co-buyer is an Affiliate controlled by the same sponsor and the sponsor provides a guaranty of all co-buyers' obligations.
2. **Second fallback:** Accept that the original Buyer's liability terminates upon assignment, but only if (a) the assignee meets minimum creditworthiness requirements, (b) the assignee assumes all obligations in writing, and (c) the assignee is not a newly formed entity with no assets.
3. **Last resort:** Accept proportionate liability without a guaranty, but negotiate a higher Deposit (or additional Deposit from each co-buyer) to compensate for the reduced credit exposure.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Primarily relevant in portfolio and TIC transactions. The risk of a thinly capitalized assignee or co-buyer is the core concern.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Portfolio (multi-property):** Several liability of co-sellers is standard and should be maintained by Seller. Joint-and-several liability of co-buyers is the seller's preferred position.
- **TIC structures:** Where Buyer is acquiring through a TIC, the allocation of liability among co-tenants must be addressed expressly.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Joint-and-several liability is enforceable in all U.S. jurisdictions for contractual obligations.

## Business Day Definition

### Preferred Position

The Business Day definition should include all standard federal holidays and the state holidays of the Property state. Seller should ensure the definition is broad enough to capture all potential non-business days, giving the parties maximum protection against inadvertent deadline failures.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Seller Side, Section 16.2):**

> "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday, or any day that is recognized as a holiday in [the state in which the Property is located]. Unless this Agreement expressly refers to "Business Days," all references in this Agreement to days shall be deemed to mean calendar days. The time periods under this Agreement shall be computed by excluding the first day and including the last day, but, if the last day falls on a calendar day that is not a Business Day, or if the computed date for Closing or any other event that requires recording of documents falls on a day on which the applicable county recording office is closed, then the time period or date in question shall extend to the next Business Day.

The Meadows form (Section 9.12) adds a useful cutoff: actions required on a Business Day must be completed by 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time) on such date.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Include the time-computation rule in the same section: exclude the first day, include the last day, extend to the next Business Day if the last day falls on a non-Business Day.
- Include the recording-office-closure extension: if the Closing date or any other date requiring recording falls on a day when the county recorder is closed, the date extends to the next day the recorder is open. This protects against unexpected recorder closures (snow days, power outages, pandemics).
- Specify the cutoff time (typically 5:00 p.m. local time at the Property). For portfolio transactions spanning multiple time zones, designate one controlling time zone.
- Consider including "or any day on which national banking institutions are closed" to capture bank-specific closures.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Minimal pushback expected. The definition is mechanical.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — But errors in the Business Day definition or time-computation rules can cause missed deadlines, which can be catastrophic in a "time is of the essence" agreement.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- State-specific holidays vary. For example, Oregon includes Indigenous Peoples' Day; Washington includes Presidents' Day (state offices closed). Ensure the definition captures relevant state closures.
- **New York:** NYC has extensive banking holidays. Consider "days on which commercial banks in New York City are open for business" formulation for NY deals.

## Force Majeure

### Preferred Position

Seller's approach to force majeure should be cautious. In institutional PSAs, Seller generally prefers **no force majeure provision** because Seller wants the Closing date to be firm and the Buyer's obligation to close to be unconditional. Force majeure provisions primarily benefit Buyer (who may need to delay Closing due to external events) and can introduce uncertainty into Seller's disposition timeline.

If a force majeure provision is included, Seller should ensure it (1) does not excuse Buyer's obligation to close or make monetary payments, (2) applies only to physical impossibility events (recording office closures, natural disasters), not commercial-impracticability events, and (3) is subject to a strict cap on the extension period.

**If force majeure must be included, preferred seller-protective language:**

> Neither party shall be deemed in default of this Agreement to the extent that any delay or failure in performance results from Force Majeure Events, which shall include only: acts of God, fire, flood, earthquake, war, terrorism, government-mandated closures of recording offices or title companies, or closure of the applicable county recorder's office. The affected party must provide prompt written notice of the Force Majeure Event and its expected duration. The Closing Date and other deadlines shall be extended day-for-day during the continuance of a Force Majeure Event, but in no event for more than thirty (30) days. If the Force Majeure Event continues beyond thirty (30) days, either party may terminate this Agreement by written notice. Force majeure shall not excuse any obligation to make monetary payments when due, shall not excuse Buyer's obligation to fund the Purchase Price, and shall not apply to any event that results solely from a party's financial condition or inability to obtain financing.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The UNICO forms, Meadows form, income property seller form, and PSA form all **omit force majeure entirely**. Seller should advocate for omission as the first position.
- If force majeure must be included, keep the enumerated events narrow: physical impossibility only (recorder closure, natural disaster, government-mandated shutdown). Exclude commercial events (market disruption, labor disputes, supply-chain delays, inability to obtain financing).
- Cap the extension at 30 days (not 60 or 90). If the force majeure continues beyond 30 days, either party may terminate. Seller should not be locked into an indefinite extension.
- Expressly exclude monetary obligations from force majeure protection. Buyer's obligation to fund the Purchase Price is absolute and should not be excused by any external event.
- Expressly exclude financial inability and financing-related events. This prevents Buyer from using "force majeure" as a disguised financing contingency.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Post-pandemic, force majeure is commercially necessary because recording offices, title companies, and escrow agents may be unable to function during a disaster, and a "time is of the essence" agreement without force majeure can put both parties in default through no fault of their own.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback (preferred):** Omit force majeure entirely. Rely on common-law impossibility doctrines if an extraordinary event prevents performance.
2. **Second fallback:** Include force majeure but limited to recording-office and title-company closures only — not broader natural disasters or pandemics. Cap at 15 days.
3. **Third fallback:** Include broader force majeure (natural disasters, pandemics, government orders) but cap at 30 days, exclude monetary obligations, and give either party a termination right.
4. **Last resort:** Accept 60-day force majeure with broader enumerated events, but maintain the exclusion for monetary obligations and the mutual termination right.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — The absence of force majeure favors Seller because it makes Buyer's obligation to close unconditional. However, force majeure also protects Seller — if a natural disaster prevents Seller from delivering clear title or obtaining necessary governmental approvals, Seller would also benefit from an extension. The risk is primarily that force majeure becomes a disguised Buyer-termination right.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Industrial (port-adjacent):** Port closures and labor strikes may warrant an enumerated force majeure event if the Property is directly impacted.
- **Data Center:** Power grid failures and utility moratoriums may warrant inclusion as force majeure events.
- **Retail (tourist markets):** Government-mandated closures and travel restrictions may be relevant.
- **All asset types:** The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that even institutional transactions can be disrupted by recording-office closures and government mandates. A narrowly drafted force majeure provision may be appropriate in all transactions as a post-pandemic market expectation.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** New York courts interpret force majeure clauses narrowly and generally require the specific event to be enumerated. A generic catch-all ("any event beyond the parties' reasonable control") may be insufficient.
- **California:** California courts apply impossibility/impracticability doctrines more liberally than New York, which may reduce the practical need for a contractual force majeure provision.
- **Texas:** Texas courts enforce force majeure clauses as written but require the event to be beyond the party's control and not caused by the party's negligence.
- **Florida:** Post-hurricane force majeure provisions are common and expected in Florida PSAs. Sellers of Florida properties should anticipate and accept force majeure for named storms.

## IRS Reporting (Section 6045(e))

### Preferred Position

Designate the Escrow Agent as the "Reporting Person" responsible for all IRS information reporting under Section 6045(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, including filing Form 1099-S. This relieves both parties of the administrative burden and potential penalties for non-compliance.

**Standard language (from PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side), Section 11.9):**

> Purchaser and Seller hereby agree that the Escrow Agent shall act as "the person responsible for closing" the transaction which is the subject of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6045(e) of the Code and shall prepare and file all informational returns, including IRS Form 1099-S, and shall otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 6045(e) of the Code. The provisions of this Section shall survive the Closing.

### Key Negotiation Points

- This is standard boilerplate. The key issue is ensuring Escrow Agent agrees to serve as Reporting Person.
- Both parties must provide taxpayer identification numbers and W-9 forms.
- If Escrow Agent refuses, the parties must agree on an alternative Reporting Person (typically the title company).
- This provision should survive Closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

No pushback expected.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Regulatory compliance provision.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Federal law applies uniformly.

---

## No Implied Agreement

### Preferred Position

Include a provision confirming that no contract arises until the agreement is fully executed and delivered by both parties, and that the exchange of drafts, correspondence, term sheets, or oral discussions does not create binding obligations. This is particularly important for Seller because institutional sellers frequently negotiate with multiple potential buyers simultaneously, and the exchange of drafts with one buyer must not create a binding obligation before Seller has selected its preferred buyer and formally executed the agreement.

**Preferred language (from PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side), Section 11.19):**

> Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall have any obligations in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement unless both Seller and Purchaser, each acting in its sole discretion, elects to execute and deliver this Agreement to the other party. No correspondence, course of dealing or submission of drafts or final versions of this Agreement between Seller and Purchaser shall be deemed to create any binding obligations in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby, and no contract or obligation on the part of Seller or Purchaser shall arise unless and until this Agreement is fully executed by both Seller and Purchaser. Once executed and delivered by Seller and Purchaser, this Agreement shall be binding upon them notwithstanding the failure of Escrow Agent or any broker or other Person to execute this Agreement.

**Additional protection (from UNICO Seller Side, Section 16.21):**

> Presentation of any draft of this Agreement by one party to the other shall not be deemed an offer.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The "not deemed an offer" language is important because without it, Buyer could argue that Seller's delivery of an executed PSA constitutes a binding offer that Buyer can accept at any time.
- Confirm that the agreement is binding even without Escrow Agent's or broker's signature. The escrow agent and broker are agents, not principals, and their failure to sign should not defeat the contract.
- The income property seller form (Section 26) adds: "Seller shall have the right to continue to market the Property and/or to negotiate with other potential Buyers of the Property until the expiration of the Due Diligence Period." This is a powerful seller right that should be included if possible — it preserves Seller's right to pursue backup offers until Buyer's diligence period expires and the Deposit goes hard.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

No pushback expected on the no-implied-agreement provision itself. Buyer may resist the right-to-continue-marketing provision from the income property seller form.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Standard provision. The primary risk is in multi-party negotiations where a binding obligation is inadvertently created through correspondence.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** N.Y. General Obligations Law Section 5-703 requires a signed writing for real property contracts (statute of frauds). The no-implied-agreement provision reinforces this statutory requirement.
- **California:** California statute of frauds (Civil Code Section 1624) similarly requires a signed writing.

---

## Limitation on Seller Liability Post-Closing (Look-to-Entity-Only)

### Preferred Position

This provision works in conjunction with the Exculpation section above and addresses the specific dollar cap, duration, threshold, and recourse limitations on Seller's post-Closing liability. Seller should negotiate for the most restrictive possible post-Closing liability framework: low claim cap, short survival period, meaningful basket/deductible, exhaustion requirement, and no consequential damages.

**Key provisions (from PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side), Section 10.4):**

> Seller and Purchaser agree that, following the Closing, each shall be liable for the direct, but not consequential, incidental, indirect, punitive, special or exemplary, damages or lost profits, resulting from any breach of its representations and warranties expressly set forth herein; provided, however, that: (i) the total liability of Seller for all such breaches and any matters relating thereto or under any law applicable to the Property or this transaction shall not, in the aggregate, exceed one percent (1%) of the Purchase Price (the "Claim Cap"); (ii) such representations and warranties are personal to Seller and Purchaser and may not be assigned to or enforced by any other Person, other than to an assignee of Purchaser in accordance with [assignment section]; (iii) the representations and warranties of Seller shall survive the Closing for a period of six (6) months, and no action or proceeding thereon shall be valid or enforceable if a legal proceeding is not commenced within that time; (iv) if the Closing occurs, Purchaser hereby expressly waives, relinquishes and releases any right or remedy to make a claim against Seller for damages that Purchaser may incur as the result of any of Seller's representations being untrue if the same was within Purchaser's Knowledge at the time of the Closing; (v) Purchaser agrees to first seek recovery under any insurance policies, Leases and Contracts prior to seeking recovery from Seller, and Seller shall not be liable to Purchaser if Purchaser's claim is satisfied from such sources; and (vi) no claim may be made unless the amount of such claim or claims, individually or in the aggregate, exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (in which event the full amount of valid claims shall be actionable up to the Claim Cap).

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Claim cap:** Seller should advocate for 1% of the Purchase Price. For a $50M transaction, this is a $500,000 cap. Resist Buyer's attempts to increase the cap to 2-5%.
- **Survival period:** Six months is the most aggressive seller position. Market range is 6-18 months. Resist anything beyond 12 months.
- **Basket/deductible:** $100,000 basket before any claim is actionable. Use a "tipping basket" (once the threshold is met, the full amount is recoverable up to the claim cap) rather than a true deductible. The tipping basket is standard and prevents micro-claims while preserving Seller's exposure to meaningful breaches.
- **No consequential damages:** Expressly exclude consequential, incidental, indirect, punitive, special, exemplary damages, and lost profits. This is a powerful limitation that prevents Buyer from claiming speculative future losses.
- **Known-breach waiver:** If Buyer closes with knowledge of a rep breach, Buyer waives any claim for that breach. This is the PSA form's "Purchaser's Knowledge" waiver and is one of the strongest seller protections available. It incentivizes Buyer to raise issues during diligence rather than sandbagging.
- **Exhaustion requirement:** Require Buyer to first seek recovery under insurance policies, leases, and contracts before pursuing Seller. This reduces Seller's effective exposure to net losses only.
- **Non-assignability of claims:** Seller's representations are personal to Buyer and may not be assigned to or enforced by any successor or subsequent purchaser (other than a permitted assignee). This prevents a subsequent buyer of the Property from pursuing Seller on inherited rep-and-warranty claims.
- **Recourse limitation:** Cross-reference the exculpation provision — post-Closing recourse is limited to net proceeds actually received by Seller (not to Seller Parties personally).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** (1) A 1% claim cap is too low for a $50M+ transaction; (2) six months is too short to discover rep breaches (particularly environmental or title-related issues); (3) the exhaustion requirement is unfair because insurance claims take months and leases may not cover the loss; (4) the known-breach waiver incentivizes Seller to disclose unfavorable information late in diligence (after the Deposit goes hard) knowing Buyer will be deemed to have "Knowledge" at Closing.

**Fallback chain:**

1. **First fallback:** Increase the claim cap from 1% to 1.5% of Purchase Price but maintain the 6-month survival period and $100,000 basket. This is a modest concession that addresses Buyer's dollar concern without materially expanding Seller's exposure.
2. **Second fallback:** Extend the survival period from 6 months to 9 months but maintain the 1% claim cap. For environmental representations only, accept 12-month survival.
3. **Third fallback:** Replace the exhaustion requirement with a credit provision — Seller receives a credit for amounts Buyer actually recovers from third-party sources, but Buyer is not required to exhaust those sources before pursuing Seller. This is faster and fairer.
4. **Fourth fallback:** Modify the known-breach waiver to apply only to matters actually known to Buyer's designated representatives (typically 2-3 named individuals), not to constructive knowledge or information contained in diligence materials that Buyer's team may not have reviewed.
5. **Last resort:** Increase the claim cap to 2% and the survival period to 12 months, but maintain all other limitations (no consequential damages, basket, credit for third-party recoveries, non-assignability, look-to-entity-only recourse).

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — This is the most economically significant negotiation in the miscellaneous provisions and arguably in the entire PSA from the seller's perspective. The combination of claim cap, survival period, basket, damage exclusions, and recourse limitations determines the total potential post-Closing exposure for Seller. A poorly negotiated liability-limitation framework can expose Seller to open-ended, multi-year claims that far exceed the economic benefit of the transaction.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office and Retail (multi-tenant):** Higher proration-adjustment and tenant-reconciliation risk. Buyer will push harder for a higher cap and longer survival. Consider a separate carve-out for proration true-ups (not subject to the claim cap or survival period) to address Buyer's specific concern.
- **Industrial (NNN):** Lower post-Closing adjustment risk. Seller should be able to maintain the most restrictive framework (1% cap, 6-month survival).
- **Multifamily:** Operating expense reconciliations, security deposit obligations, and rent-roll accuracy are common post-Closing disputes. Consider a separate proration true-up mechanism outside the claim cap.
- **Data Center:** Complex tenant relationships, infrastructure warranties, and equipment inventories create higher post-Closing claim risk. Buyer may demand a 2-3% cap and 12-18 month survival.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Delaware:** Delaware courts enforce contractual claim caps and survival limitations. Delaware is the most favorable jurisdiction for restrictive liability frameworks.
- **New York:** New York courts enforce claim caps and survival periods but may be more willing to entertain fraud-based claims that fall outside the contractual limitations.
- **California:** California courts are generally willing to enforce contractual liability limitations in commercial transactions between sophisticated parties, but unconscionability challenges are possible for extremely low caps.
- **Texas:** Texas courts enforce contractual limitations as written in commercial transactions.

---

## Attorneys' Fees

### Preferred Position

Include a mutual prevailing-party attorneys' fees provision covering all actions to enforce or interpret the agreement. This benefits Seller by deterring Buyer from bringing frivolous post-Closing claims and by ensuring Seller can recover the costs of defending against unjustified claims.

**Preferred language (from PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side), Section 11.8):**

> In the event of a judicial or administrative proceeding or action by one party against the other party with respect to the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, whether at the investigative, pretrial, trial or appellate level. The prevailing party shall be determined by the court based upon an assessment of which party's major arguments or position prevailed. The provisions of this Section shall survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the provision is mutual. Do not accept a one-sided fee-shifting provision.
- Include pre-trial, trial, and appellate fees (the PSA form's "investigative, pretrial, trial or appellate" formulation is the broadest in the precedent set).
- Specify the prevailing-party standard: "based upon an assessment of which party's major arguments or position prevailed." This prevents a party from claiming prevailing-party status based on a minor procedural victory.
- This provision should survive Closing and termination.
- Ensure the fee provision is not capped by the claim cap in the post-Closing liability limitation. Attorneys' fees for enforcement actions should be recoverable in addition to (not counted against) the claim cap.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Generally accepted in all jurisdictions. Buyer may prefer the American Rule (each party bears its own fees) if Buyer anticipates being the claimant in post-Closing disputes.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Standard provision that benefits Seller by creating a deterrent against frivolous post-Closing claims.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** The American Rule applies absent contractual override. The contractual provision is enforceable.
- **California:** California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1021 follows the American Rule, but contractual fee-shifting is common and enforceable. Note that under California Civil Code Section 1717, if a contract provides for attorney's fees to one party, the provision is deemed mutual.
- **Texas, Oregon, Washington:** All enforce contractual attorneys' fees provisions.

---

## No Joint Venture / No Partnership

### Preferred Position

Include a provision confirming that the agreement does not create a joint venture, partnership, or agency relationship between Seller and Buyer. This prevents Buyer or any third party from asserting that Seller and Buyer are engaged in a joint enterprise that could create joint-and-several tort liability or impose fiduciary duties.

**Standard language (from UNICO Seller Side, Section 16.13):**

> Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a joint venture between Purchaser and Seller.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Standard boilerplate. Particularly important if the agreement contemplates any transition period, shared property management, or interim operations between signing and Closing.
- Consider expanding to expressly disclaim any agency or fiduciary relationship.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

No pushback expected.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Standard provision.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Universally enforceable.

---

## No Waiver

### Preferred Position

Include a provision confirming that no waiver of any provision is effective unless in writing and signed by the waiving party, that a waiver of one provision does not constitute a waiver of any other provision, and that a waiver in one instance does not constitute a continuing waiver or a waiver in any subsequent instance.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Seller Side, Section 16.15):**

> No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver, nor shall a waiver in any instance constitute a waiver in any subsequent instance. No waiver shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party making the waiver.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Ensure the waiver provision requires a writing "executed" (i.e., signed) by the waiving party — not merely a writing. Email communications could otherwise be construed as waivers.
- This provision works in conjunction with the written-amendment requirement and the time-of-the-essence clause to prevent Buyer from arguing that Seller's acceptance of late performance constituted a waiver of Seller's right to enforce deadlines in the future.
- The PSA form (Section 11.4) adds a useful clarification: "No delay in exercising any right or remedy shall constitute a waiver thereof." This prevents Buyer from arguing that Seller's delay in enforcing a right constitutes an implied waiver.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

No pushback expected.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Standard provision.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- Universally enforceable.

---

## No Merger (Anti-Merger)

### Preferred Position

Include an anti-merger provision confirming that the covenants, agreements, representations, and warranties in the PSA survive Closing and do not merge into the deed. However, from the seller's perspective, the anti-merger clause should be **expressly limited by the survival period and claim cap** in the post-Closing liability limitation provision. Seller does not want an open-ended anti-merger clause that gives Buyer unlimited post-Closing claims.

**Preferred language (from UNICO Seller Side, Section 16.18):**

> Subject to the limitations set forth in [rep survival section] and [confidentiality section], the covenants, agreements, representations, and warranties made herein shall survive the Closing Date and shall not merge into the deed and its recordation in the official records or the delivery at Closing of any assignment of leases, general assignment, or bill of sale.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The "subject to the limitations" qualifier is critical for Seller. Without it, the anti-merger clause would override the survival period and claim cap, giving Buyer open-ended post-Closing claims.
- Ensure the cross-references to the survival-period and claim-cap provisions are accurate.
- The PSA form (Section 11.16(a)) adds a complementary provision: "The acceptance of the Deed shall constitute full performance of all of Seller's obligations hereunder other than those obligations of Seller that by the express terms hereof survive the Closing." This deed-acceptance-as-full-performance language operates as an independent merger clause for all non-surviving obligations.
- Ensure the anti-merger clause covers all closing documents (deed, assignment of leases, assignment of contracts, bill of sale) — not just the deed.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Buyer may resist the "subject to limitations" qualifier and argue for an unqualified anti-merger clause. Seller should explain that the anti-merger clause is necessary to preserve surviving obligations but should not be used to circumvent the carefully negotiated survival period and claim cap.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — An unqualified anti-merger clause can undermine Seller's post-Closing liability limitations by creating an argument that all representations survive indefinitely. The "subject to limitations" qualifier is the key protection.

### Asset-Type Variations

- No significant asset-type variations.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** New York strongly enforces the common-law merger doctrine absent a contractual anti-merger clause. Seller should include the anti-merger clause (with limitations) to avoid the risk that the merger doctrine extinguishes obligations that Seller affirmatively wants to survive (e.g., Buyer's post-Closing cooperation obligations, proration true-up obligations).
- **California and other states:** Similar principles apply. The anti-merger clause is standard across all jurisdictions.

---

## Statutory Disclaimers

### Preferred Position

Certain states require specific statutory disclaimers in real property transfer documents. Seller should include all applicable statutory disclaimers and, where possible, leverage statutory waiver provisions to limit Seller's disclosure obligations.

**Example: Washington (from income property seller form, Section 32):**

> PURSUANT TO RCW CH. 64.06, AS AMENDED, BUYER HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE SELLER DISCLOSURE STATEMENT REFERRED TO THEREIN. THIS WAIVER DOES NOT EXTEND TO THE SECTION OF THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT ENTITLED "ENVIRONMENTAL."

**Example: Oregon (from Meadows, Section 9.13):**

> THE PROPERTY DESCRIBED IN THIS INSTRUMENT MAY NOT BE WITHIN A FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT PROTECTING STRUCTURES. THE PROPERTY IS SUBJECT TO LAND USE LAWS AND REGULATIONS...

### Key Negotiation Points

- In commercial transactions, statutory seller disclosure requirements are frequently waivable. Seller should include the waiver in the PSA and obtain Buyer's express written waiver of disclosure rights (as in the Washington example).
- For Oregon properties, the ORS land-use disclaimer is mandatory in all transfer instruments, including the PSA and the deed.
- Verify that the statutory disclaimers are the current versions, as legislatures periodically amend these requirements.
- The Washington waiver carves out the "Environmental" section — Seller must still provide the environmental disclosure. Ensure this is limited to the statutory form and does not expand Seller's environmental representations beyond what is in the PSA.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Statutory disclaimers are mandatory. The only negotiation is around the scope of any related contractual waiver of disclosure rights. Buyer may resist broad waivers and insist on receiving the full statutory disclosure.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Compliance issue. The primary risk is omission (failing to include a required disclaimer or waiver) rather than adverse drafting.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Commercial properties in residential-focused states:** Statutory disclosure requirements are often designed for residential transactions. For commercial properties, the buyer typically waives the residential disclosure statement and the parties rely on the PSA representations and due diligence process instead.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Oregon:** ORS 93.040 requires the land-use disclaimer in all transfer instruments.
- **Washington:** RCW 64.06 seller disclosure statement applies but is waivable in commercial transactions.
- **California:** The Transfer Disclosure Statement (Cal. Civ. Code Section 1102) is required for residential but not commercial transfers.
- **New York:** No equivalent statutory disclaimer for commercial transactions.
- **Texas:** Property Condition Disclosure (Tex. Prop. Code Section 5.008) applies primarily to residential; commercial transactions are typically exempt.
