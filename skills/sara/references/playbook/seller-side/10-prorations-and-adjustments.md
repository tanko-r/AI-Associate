# Section 10: Prorations and Adjustments -- Seller Playbook

> **Orientation:** This playbook addresses every proration and adjustment concept a seller's counsel must negotiate in an institutional commercial real estate disposition. The seller's overriding objectives are: (1) maximize net proceeds by ensuring the seller receives full credit for income earned and expenses paid during its ownership period, (2) minimize post-closing exposure and lingering obligations, (3) establish hard deadlines and finality on all reconciliation mechanics, (4) shift post-closing economic risk (reassessment, unfunded leasing costs, tenant collection risk) to the buyer, and (5) enable the seller entity to wind up and dissolve promptly after closing.

## 1. Proration Methodology and Day-of-Closing Allocation

### Preferred Position
The proration cutoff should be 12:01 a.m. on the closing date (i.e., the buyer is deemed to own the property for the entire day of closing). All prorations should be calculated on an actual-days-elapsed / actual-days-in-month / 365-day-year basis. The seller should prepare the draft proration schedule and control the closing statement process. The preliminary closing statement should be submitted 5 business days before closing, with the parties agreeing on the final statement at least 2 business days before closing.

**Cross-reference:** The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(a)) uses "12:01 a.m. on the date on which the Closing occurs," which gives the buyer responsibility for the full closing day. The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 11.7.1-11.7.2) uses "11:59 pm Pacific Time on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date" -- a functionally equivalent formulation. Both the Meadows form and the UNICO forms confirm the actual-day methodology.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Seller controls the proration schedule:** The seller has the historical financial data and should prepare the first draft of the proration schedule. This gives the seller the advantage of framing the calculations.
- **Closing statement finality:** Include language that the closing statement, once agreed, is binding absent manifest error. This prevents the buyer from re-litigating prorations post-closing.
- **Closing Date extension for proration disputes:** Include the right for either party to extend closing by 2 business days if the closing statement cannot be agreed (per UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.8). This protects the seller from a buyer who uses proration disputes to delay closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer wants the day of closing:** This is standard and the seller should not fight it. The economic difference is approximately one day of NOI, which is not worth the negotiation capital.
- **Buyer wants to prepare the proration schedule:** **Fallback:** Allow the buyer to prepare the schedule, but require the seller to provide all supporting data within 5 business days of closing, and give the seller approval rights over the final statement.
- **Buyer wants 30/360 methodology:** **Resist.** Actual-day methodology is universally accepted and avoids arguments about whether the simplification favors one party.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk.** The methodology is well-settled in institutional transactions. The key risk for the seller is losing control of the proration schedule preparation.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No significant variation. The methodology is consistent across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **All jurisdictions:** Ensure the proration cutoff time references the correct local time zone. The UNICO Seller Side form specifies "Pacific Time" -- adjust to match the property's location.

## 2. Real Property Tax Prorations

### Preferred Position
Real property taxes should be prorated based on the **most recent actual tax bill** available at closing. If the current-year bill is not available, the proration should be based on the prior-year bill applied to the latest assessed valuation, with a reproration when the actual bill becomes available. Critically, the seller should **not** be responsible for any increase in real property taxes resulting from (a) the sale of the property to the buyer, (b) any reassessment triggered by the change of ownership, or (c) any improvements made or leases entered into after closing. Furthermore, the seller should have no obligation to prorate taxes to the extent the buyer is entitled to reimbursement from tenants under the leases.

**Cross-reference:** The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(c)) is the gold standard for seller-protective tax proration language. It provides: "in no event shall Seller be charged with or responsible for any increase in real estate taxes resulting from the sale of the Property to Purchaser or from any improvements made or Leases entered into on or after the Closing." It further provides that the seller has "no obligation to pay (and Purchaser shall not receive a credit at Closing for) any real estate or personal property taxes or special assessments to the extent that Purchaser is entitled after Closing to reimbursement of taxes and assessments...from the tenants under the Leases, regardless of whether Purchaser actually collects such reimbursement." The form also includes an express reassessment/escape assessment indemnity from the buyer (Section 8.4(c)(second paragraph)).

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Reassessment protection:** This is the seller's most important tax proration position. In jurisdictions that reassess on change of ownership (California, Illinois, and many others), the reassessment can dramatically increase taxes for the year of closing. The seller's position is that the reassessment is a consequence of the buyer's purchase and should be the buyer's responsibility for the buyer's period of ownership.
  - **Strongest position:** The seller bears no portion of any reassessment increase, even for its period of ownership in the year of closing. The proration for the seller's period is based on the pre-sale assessment.
  - **First fallback:** The seller bears the reassessment increase for its period of ownership, but only based on the actual reassessment, not on an estimated or projected reassessment.
  - **Second fallback:** The seller and buyer share the reassessment increase for the year of closing based on their respective periods of ownership, but the buyer indemnifies the seller against any supplemental tax attributable to the sale.
- **Tenant reimbursement offset:** The seller should argue that it should not have to fund a tax proration credit when the buyer will be reimbursed by tenants for those same taxes. The Detailed Seller Side form's provision eliminating the seller's proration obligation to the extent of tenant reimbursement rights is extremely powerful. This shifts the collection burden to the buyer but ensures the seller does not subsidize the buyer's tenant reimbursement income.
- **Tax refunds:** For pending tax appeals, the seller should share in any refund for its period of ownership. Require that refunds be allocated: first to costs of obtaining the refund, then to tenants (to the extent required by leases), then to the seller (for its period) and the buyer (for its period).
- **Tax protest escrow:** Resist buyer demands for a tax protest escrow. Instead, include a surviving obligation for the buyer to remit the seller's share of any refund within 30 days of receipt.
- **Assessment installments:** For special assessments payable in installments, the seller should pay only those installments due and payable before closing. Future installments (even if assessed before closing) should be the buyer's responsibility. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(g)) provides: "Seller shall not be required to pay any installments of special assessments that relate to projects that have not been completed as of the Effective Date."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer insists seller bear reassessment risk for seller's period:** **Fallback:** Accept a proration based on the pre-sale assessment plus a reasonable estimate of the increase, but cap the seller's exposure at the amount of any tax proration credit already built into the purchase price.
- **Buyer rejects the tenant reimbursement offset:** This is the buyer's strongest argument (collecting from tenants is uncertain). **Fallback:** Remove the offset for tenants who are actually delinquent at closing, but maintain it for current-paying tenants who are contractually obligated to reimburse taxes.
- **Buyer demands seller fund a tax protest escrow:** **Fallback:** Agree to an escrow, but limit it to the seller's share of the reasonably expected refund (not the maximum possible refund), and include a release mechanism if no refund is received within 24 months.
- **Buyer wants to control all tax appeals:** **Fallback:** Allow buyer control of appeals for the year of closing and beyond, but require buyer to consult with the seller before settling any appeal for a pre-closing year, and require buyer to prosecute pre-closing appeals with reasonable diligence.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk** in reassessment jurisdictions. The seller's exposure is the delta between pre-sale and post-sale assessments, prorated for the seller's period of ownership.
- **Medium risk** with the tenant reimbursement offset in place (which effectively eliminates the seller's net exposure for NNN and modified gross properties).
- **Low risk** in states without change-of-ownership reassessment (e.g., many northeastern states).

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office/Retail:** Tenant reimbursement offset argument is strong for NNN and base-year-stop leases (though the base-year stop may create a gap).
- **Industrial:** Full NNN pass-through makes the tenant reimbursement offset argument strongest.
- **Multifamily:** No tenant pass-throughs. The seller has the weakest position on the tenant reimbursement offset. Focus instead on the reassessment protection.
- **Data Center:** Check for abatements, enterprise zone credits, or PILOT agreements that may affect the tax proration.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **California:** Proposition 13 reassessment to full market value on transfer. Supplemental taxes will be issued. The seller's position should be that supplemental taxes attributable to the sale are entirely the buyer's responsibility.
- **Illinois:** Cook County triennial reassessment. If the property is in a reassessment year, the risk is heightened. The seller should include the Detailed Seller Side form's reassessment indemnity.
- **New York:** Transitional assessments and differential assessment ratios create complexity. NYC property class changes can trigger significant tax increases.
- **Texas:** Annual revaluation to market value. The seller should ensure that pending protests are addressed in the proration.
- **Colorado/Massachusetts:** The Detailed Seller Side form was drafted for these jurisdictions and provides the strongest seller protections.

## 3. Rent Prorations (Current Month)

### Preferred Position
Rent for the month of closing should be prorated based on the actual number of days in the month. The seller should be entitled to all rent attributable to the period before the closing date. The proration should be based on rents actually collected -- the seller should not be required to give a credit for any rent that has not been collected as of closing. Prepaid rents attributable to post-closing periods should be credited to the buyer, but only to the extent actually collected.

**Cross-reference:** The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(b)) provides: "Seller shall be entitled to all Rent attributable to any period before the Closing Date. Rent for the month in which the Closing occurs shall be pro rated between Seller and Purchaser based upon the number of days in such month." The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 11.7.1) similarly provides that "all rentals and other income collected from the Property" shall be prorated. Note the word "collected" -- this is favorable to the seller as it limits the proration to amounts actually in hand.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **"Collected" vs. "accrued" basis:** Insist on "collected" rent basis for prorations. This ensures the seller does not give a credit for rent that tenants have not yet paid. The buyer may argue for an "accrued" basis (prorating based on what is owed rather than what is collected), which would give the seller credit for uncollected rent. While accrued-basis would benefit the seller for some items, it also creates the risk that the seller must give credit for amounts it never received.
- **Income stream breadth:** Accept that all income streams are prorated (base rent, additional rent, parking, storage, antenna, etc.), but ensure the seller receives its proportionate share of all income, not just base rent.
- **Parking lease reproration:** The Detailed Seller Side form provides a favorable mechanism for parking leases: initial proration based on the prior month's rent, with retroactive reproration when the actual month's rent is determined. This benefits the seller when parking revenue is trending upward.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer wants "accrued" basis proration:** This would mean the seller gets credit for rent that has been billed but not yet collected. While superficially favorable to the seller, it also means the seller must credit the buyer for accrued but unpaid expenses. **Fallback:** Accept "collected" basis for both income and expenses to maintain consistency.
- **Buyer wants to exclude certain income streams:** **Resist.** All income from the property should be prorated. If an income stream is excluded, the buyer gets a windfall.
- **Buyer argues prepaid rents should be credited at closing even if not collected:** **Respond:** Prepaid rents by definition have been collected. The credit is appropriate only for amounts the seller has actually received.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** for current-month rent proration. The amounts are well-defined and verifiable.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Retail:** Percentage rent adds complexity. See Section 4 below.
- **All others:** Standard monthly proration.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Florida:** Sales tax on commercial rent must be prorated. Ensure the proration captures the tax component.
- **Arizona:** Transaction Privilege Tax on rental income. Prorate accordingly.

---

## 4. Percentage Rent

### Preferred Position
Percentage rent should be excluded from the closing prorations. The seller should retain all percentage rent collected before closing for the seller's period of ownership. For the lease year in which closing occurs, the seller should receive its proportionate share of any percentage rent calculated after year-end, based on the seller's period of ownership as a fraction of the lease year. The breakpoint should be applied to the full year's sales before any allocation between the parties.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Exclusion from closing prorations:** Because percentage rent is calculated annually (typically well after closing), it cannot be prorated at closing. Include it in the post-closing reconciliation mechanics instead.
- **Proportionate share calculation:** The seller's share = (percentage rent above breakpoint) x (seller's days of ownership / total days in lease year). This should be calculated after applying the full-year breakpoint to full-year sales.
- **Tenant sales reporting:** Require the buyer to provide the seller with copies of all tenant sales reports for the year of closing and to cooperate in any audit of tenant sales.
- **Survival:** The percentage rent reconciliation obligation must expressly survive closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer wants to retain all percentage rent for the year of closing:** **Reject.** The seller is entitled to its proportionate share. **Fallback:** If the buyer insists on retaining all percentage rent, demand a credit at closing equal to the seller's estimated share based on prior-year sales.
- **Buyer wants to split the breakpoint:** (Each party's breakpoint = annual breakpoint x fraction of year.) This is actually favorable to the seller because it lowers the effective breakpoint for the seller's period, increasing the seller's percentage rent share. **Accept** if offered, though it is unusual.
- **Buyer refuses to cooperate on tenant audits:** **Require** cooperation as an express surviving covenant.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk** in retail-heavy properties.
- **Low risk** in non-retail properties.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Retail:** Primary relevance. Ensure percentage rent from all retail tenants is captured.
- **Office/Industrial/Multifamily/Data Center:** Generally not applicable.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant jurisdictional variation.

## 5. Delinquent Rent Collection and Allocation

### Preferred Position
Delinquent rent should not be prorated at closing (the seller should not be required to give the buyer credit for uncollected amounts). After closing, any payments received from delinquent tenants should be allocated in the following order: (1) first, to rent owed for the month of closing (split between seller and buyer based on their respective periods of ownership); (2) second, to rent owed for the month immediately following closing (retained by buyer); (3) third, to rent owed for the month immediately preceding closing (remitted to seller); (4) fourth, to rent owed for any post-closing period (retained by buyer); (5) fifth, to rent owed for any remaining pre-closing period (remitted to seller). The seller should retain the right to independently pursue collection of delinquent rents from pre-closing periods.

**Cross-reference:** The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(f)) establishes the seller-favorable five-tier waterfall described above. This prioritizes the closing month and the months closest to closing, then allocates subsequent months to the buyer and remaining prior months to the seller. The key advantage for the seller is that the month immediately preceding closing (tier 3, seller) gets priority over any post-closing months beyond the month following closing (tier 4, buyer). The UNICO Seller Side form uses a simpler three-tier waterfall (current month, then buyer's period, then seller's period) which is less favorable to the seller.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **No credit for delinquencies:** Both parties agree on this point. The seller should never give the buyer credit for rent it failed to collect.
- **Waterfall priority:** Push for the five-tier waterfall from the Detailed Seller Side form. The key seller benefit is tier 3 (month immediately preceding closing) getting priority over tiers 4-5. This is justified because (a) the month before closing is closest in time to the collection effort and (b) the buyer is in the best position to collect from tenants going forward.
- **Buyer's collection obligations:** The buyer should be required to bill delinquent tenants in the ordinary course and use "commercially reasonable efforts" to collect. The buyer should not be permitted to waive or reduce delinquent rent owed for the seller's period without the seller's written consent. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(b)) includes this critical protection.
- **Seller's independent collection rights:** The seller should retain the right to pursue delinquent tenants directly, including through legal proceedings, subject to the restriction that the seller may not terminate any lease or evict any tenant. The Detailed Seller Side form preserves this right.
- **Seller reporting rights:** The seller should have the right to receive regular reports from the buyer on collection of delinquent rent and to inspect the buyer's rental records. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(f)) provides for this.
- **Collection cost allocation:** Any amounts remitted to the seller should be net of the buyer's "reasonable, third-party" collection costs. Cap the deduction to avoid abuse.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer insists on three-tier waterfall (current month, buyer, seller):** **Fallback:** Accept the three-tier waterfall, but require the buyer to bill delinquent tenants for 6 months and to remit seller's share within 10 business days of receipt.
- **Buyer refuses to bill delinquent tenants:** **Reject.** A minimum billing obligation is standard. **Fallback:** Accept "ordinary course" billing (no obligation to litigate), but with a 6-month minimum duration.
- **Buyer wants to limit seller's independent collection rights:** **Fallback:** Accept a 12-month limitation on the seller's independent collection rights, but preserve the seller's right to pursue any tenant against whom the seller commenced proceedings before closing.
- **Buyer wants tenant-designated payments to control allocation:** **Fallback:** Accept tenant-designated payments where the tenant specifically identifies the payment period in writing at the time of payment. Reject any retroactive designation.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk.** The seller's exposure is the uncollected rent from its period of ownership. The waterfall priority and the buyer's billing obligations are the key protections.
- **Higher risk** on properties with significant delinquencies (retail, Class B/C office, multifamily in soft markets).

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office:** Generally low delinquency rates for institutional tenants. Primary risk is credit-impaired tenants.
- **Industrial:** Similar to office.
- **Retail:** Higher delinquency risk. Post-COVID delinquencies in certain retail segments remain elevated.
- **Multifamily:** High volume of small delinquencies. The five-tier waterfall may be administratively burdensome; consider a simplified approach.
- **Data Center:** Very low delinquency risk.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **All jurisdictions:** Ensure the seller's independent collection rights do not conflict with state landlord-tenant laws governing assignment of claims.

## 6. CAM/Operating Expense Reconciliations

### Preferred Position
For the year of closing, operating expense pass-through reconciliation should be handled as follows: (1) at closing, estimated pass-through payments collected from tenants for the post-closing period should be credited to the buyer; (2) upon the buyer's year-end reconciliation, the parties should make an adjusting payment so that (a) the seller receives its share of any under-collections for the seller's period of ownership and (b) the seller reimburses any over-collections for the seller's period of ownership. The buyer should be responsible for preparing the year-end reconciliation and billing tenants. The seller should have no obligation to prorate operating expenses to the extent the buyer is entitled to reimbursement from tenants.

**Cross-reference:** The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(e)) provides the seller-favorable framework: "Seller, as landlord under the Leases, is currently collecting from Tenants...additional rent to cover taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs and expenses...If Seller collected estimated prepayments of Operating Expense Pass-Throughs attributable to any period after Closing, Seller shall pay or credit such amounts to Purchaser at Closing." The reconciliation process (under-collections reimbursed to seller, over-collections refunded by seller) is handled post-closing.

The most powerful seller protection is in Section 8.4(c) (second paragraph) of the Detailed Seller Side form: the seller has no obligation to prorate taxes or operating expenses to the extent the buyer is entitled to reimbursement from tenants, "regardless of whether Purchaser actually collects such reimbursement."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Buyer prepares the reconciliation:** The seller's preferred position is that the buyer, as the successor landlord, prepares the year-end operating expense reconciliation. This avoids the seller having to maintain accounting staff and records after closing.
- **Seller's limited disclosure obligation:** The seller should deliver books and records at closing sufficient for the buyer to complete the reconciliation. Beyond that, the seller's post-closing cooperation should be limited to reasonable requests for 90 days.
- **Tenant reimbursement offset:** Maintain the position that the seller has no obligation to prorate expenses that are reimbursable by tenants. This eliminates the seller's out-of-pocket exposure for the vast majority of operating expenses.
- **Estimated payment credit:** Any estimated pass-through payments collected by the seller for post-closing periods must be credited to the buyer at closing. This is universally accepted.
- **Under-collection remittance:** When the buyer bills tenants for under-collected operating expense amounts attributable to the seller's period, the buyer should remit the seller's share within 30 days of collection. The seller should not have to wait for the buyer's year-end reconciliation process.
- **Over-collection responsibility:** If the seller over-collected estimated payments for its period, the seller should reimburse the buyer within 30 days of the buyer's reconciliation, and the buyer should then credit the appropriate tenants.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer insists seller prepare the reconciliation:** **Fallback:** The seller can agree to prepare the initial reconciliation for its period of ownership (per the Seller Income Property form approach: seller delivers final calculation with general ledger within 60 days after closing). But the seller should insist on a 60-day review period for the buyer to accept or dispute, after which the reconciliation becomes final.
- **Buyer rejects the tenant reimbursement offset:** **Fallback:** Accept a modified version: the seller prorates expenses but receives a credit for the buyer's expected tenant reimbursement based on current-year estimates. This preserves the economic result while addressing the buyer's concern about collection risk.
- **Buyer wants longer reconciliation periods:** **Fallback:** Accept up to 120 days after calendar year-end for the year-end true-up, but insist on finality after that period (no re-opening of reconciliation).
- **Buyer wants ongoing audit rights:** **Fallback:** Allow buyer access to the seller's books and records for 6 months after closing (not 12 months). After 6 months, the reconciliation is final and binding.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk.** The seller's primary risk is (a) having to reimburse over-collections for its period and (b) being unable to collect its share of under-collections if the buyer does not diligently bill tenants.
- **Low risk** if the tenant reimbursement offset is in place, as it eliminates the seller's out-of-pocket exposure.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office:** Complex base-year-stop and gross-up calculations. The seller should ensure the buyer's reconciliation correctly applies base years established during the seller's ownership.
- **Industrial:** NNN structures simplify the reconciliation. The seller's exposure is minimal.
- **Retail:** CAM reconciliation is the most complex. Merchant association dues, marketing funds, and exclusion areas add layers.
- **Multifamily:** Typically no operating expense pass-throughs. The reconciliation issue is limited to RUBS.
- **Data Center:** Power and cooling cost reconciliation requires specialized calculations.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant jurisdictional variation. This is primarily a contractual matter.

---

## 7. Utility Prorations

### Preferred Position
Utilities should be read on the closing date and final-billed to the seller through the closing date. The seller should be entitled to recover utility deposits and any prepayment discounts. If final reads are not available, utilities should be prorated based on the best estimate and readjusted within 30 days. The seller should receive "the entire advantage of any discounts for any prepayment by Seller prior to the Closing."

**Cross-reference:** The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(h)) provides: "Seller shall receive the entire advantage of any discounts for any prepayment by Seller prior to the Closing of any taxes, water or sewer charges, utility expenses or similar charges." This protects the seller against a buyer claiming a credit for prepayment benefits the seller already realized. The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 11.7.3) provides for utility deposits to be credited to the seller at closing.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Meter read timing:** Both parties should cooperate in arranging meter reads as close to closing as practicable. The UNICO Seller Side form places responsibility on the buyer to arrange reads, which is favorable to the seller.
- **Deposit credit or refund:** The seller should receive a credit at closing for all transferable utility deposits. For non-transferable deposits, the seller should retain the right to obtain a direct refund from the utility company. The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 11.7.3) expressly preserves this: "Seller shall be entitled to recover and retain from the providers of such utilities any refunds or overpayments to the extent applicable to the period prior to the Closing Date, and any utility deposits for which it does not receive a credit hereunder."
- **No duplication with pass-throughs:** Ensure the utility proration does not double-count amounts already captured in operating expense pass-through prorations.
- **Prepayment discount retention:** Per the Detailed Seller Side form, the seller retains the benefit of any prepayment discounts.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer wants seller to arrange final reads:** **Fallback:** Accept joint responsibility. The seller should provide authorization letters for the buyer to contact utility companies.
- **Buyer contests prepayment discount retention:** **Fallback:** This is a minor point. If the buyer argues the discount should be shared, accept a split for the month of closing only.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk.** Utility prorations are generally straightforward and involve relatively small amounts.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Data Center:** Utility costs can be enormous. Ensure the proration is accurate and accounts for demand charges, power factor adjustments, and contracted rates under PPAs.
- **Industrial:** Large utility consumers may have seasonal billing or demand charges.
- **All others:** Standard.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Utility deposit transfer rules vary by provider.

---

## 8. Insurance Prorations

### Preferred Position
The seller's insurance policies should **not** be assigned to the buyer. Each party should maintain its own insurance coverage. No proration of insurance premiums is required.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 11.7.3) confirms: "none of the insurance policies relating to the Property will be assigned to Purchaser."

### Key Negotiation Points
- This is generally a non-issue in institutional transactions. The seller wants to cancel its policies and stop paying premiums. The buyer wants its own coverage.
- **Tail coverage:** The seller should ensure it has tail coverage for any claims that may be made after closing for incidents during the seller's period of ownership. This is an insurance matter, not a PSA proration, but it should be coordinated.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer requests policy assignment:** **Reject** unless there is a compelling reason (e.g., the seller has a favorable terrorism or earthquake policy that the buyer cannot replicate). If assignment is agreed, the buyer should reimburse the seller for the unearned premium.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk.**

### Asset-Type Variations
- No significant variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant variation.

---

## 9. Security Deposit Credits

### Preferred Position
Cash security deposits should be credited to the buyer at closing as an adjustment to the purchase price. Letters of credit and other non-cash security should be transferred to the buyer at closing, with the parties executing a separate letter agreement governing the transfer mechanics (per the Detailed Seller Side form approach). The buyer should assume all obligations related to security deposits upon closing. The seller should be fully released from liability for security deposits upon transfer.

**Cross-reference:** The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(b)) provides for crediting security deposits and handling LOCs through "a letter agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit K." The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 11.7.1) provides for credit of all cash deposits and transfer of non-cash deposits.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Complete release upon transfer:** The seller must be fully released from all security deposit obligations upon closing. The buyer assumes these obligations. This is critical for the seller entity's ability to wind up.
- **LOC transfer mechanics:** For transferable LOCs, the seller should execute transfer documents and deliver the original LOC. For non-transferable LOCs, the seller should deliver the original LOC and provide reasonable cooperation (but not fund any costs) to facilitate reissuance.
- **LOC transfer costs:** The seller's position is that the buyer or tenant bears the LOC transfer costs. The seller should not have to pay fees associated with the buyer's new banking relationship.
- **Applied deposits:** If the seller has applied security deposits to cure tenant defaults (in accordance with the lease), the seller should provide documentation. The credit at closing should reflect the actual deposit balance, not the original deposit amount.
- **Interest on deposits:** In jurisdictions requiring interest on deposits, the accrued interest should be credited to the buyer. The seller should verify the interest calculation during the pre-closing period.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer wants seller to bear LOC transfer costs:** **Fallback:** Split transfer costs equally, or agree that transfer costs are borne by the tenant if the lease so provides.
- **Buyer disputes applied deposit amounts:** Require the buyer to raise deposit discrepancies during due diligence. Any undisclosed deposit applications are a breach of the seller's representation, subject to the seller's representation and warranty survival period and liability cap.
- **Buyer wants seller cooperation on non-transferable LOCs post-closing:** **Fallback:** Agree to 60 days of post-closing cooperation, without expenditure of funds, as an express surviving obligation.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** for cash deposits (straightforward credit).
- **Medium risk** for LOC transfers (bank processing delays can create post-closing complications).
- **Low risk** overall if the exhibit of security deposits is accurate and current.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Multifamily:** High volume of small deposits. State security deposit laws are strict. Ensure compliance with transfer and notice requirements.
- **Office/Industrial:** LOC deposits are common for larger tenants.
- **Data Center:** Large deposits (sometimes several months' rent) in LOC form.
- **Retail:** Mix of cash and LOC deposits.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** GOL Section 7-103 requires specific handling. Notice to tenants of the transfer is required.
- **California:** Civil Code Section 1950.7. Statutory transferee liability.
- **Illinois:** Security Deposit Return Act. Strict penalties.
- **Massachusetts:** Chapter 186, Section 15B. Treble damages for violations. Seller must ensure compliance with statutory transfer requirements.

---

## 10. Prepaid Rents

### Preferred Position
Prepaid rents for post-closing periods should be credited to the buyer at closing. The seller should retain all rent attributable to its period of ownership, including any advance payments for the seller's period.

### Key Negotiation Points
- This is generally non-controversial. The key seller concern is ensuring that the "prepaid" characterization is accurate. Advance deposits that are nonrefundable to the tenant should be distinguished from prepaid rent.
- Ensure that any "first month's rent" or "last month's rent" deposits are properly classified. First month's rent applied to the first month of the lease term is not a prepaid rent requiring credit (it was earned income during the seller's period). Last month's rent is a prepaid amount requiring credit.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- Generally non-controversial.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk.**

### Asset-Type Variations
- No significant variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Governed primarily by lease terms.

---

## 11. Tenant Improvement Allowances and Leasing Commissions

### Preferred Position
All Lease Expenses (TI allowances, leasing commissions, and other tenant inducements) payable on or after the closing date should be the **buyer's** responsibility, regardless of when the lease was executed. The rationale is that these costs produce the income stream the buyer is acquiring, and the purchase price was determined based on the in-place income net of these costs. The seller should have no obligation for any Lease Expenses that are due or payable after closing.

**Cross-reference:** The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(m)) provides the strongest seller position: "Purchaser shall pay and be responsible for all Purchaser Lease Expenses. At Closing, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for any and all Purchaser Lease Expenses to the extent the same have been paid by Seller prior to Closing." The definition of "Purchaser Lease Expenses" (Section 1) encompasses essentially all post-closing leasing costs, including those under existing leases. The buyer must also "assume the obligation to pay, when due (whether on a stated due date or by acceleration) any Purchaser Lease Expenses that are unpaid as of the Closing, and Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless from and against any and all claims and costs relating to all Purchaser Lease Expenses."

Compare with the UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 7.3), which is the buyer's preferred approach: seller credits the buyer for all unfunded existing leasing costs, and the buyer is responsible only for new leasing costs on leases approved by the buyer after the due diligence deadline.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **All post-closing costs to buyer:** The seller's strongest position is that the buyer assumes all Lease Expenses payable after closing, regardless of when the obligation was incurred. This is the Detailed Seller Side form approach. The economic argument is that the purchase price reflects the stabilized income from the leases, and the cost to achieve that income is part of what the buyer is paying for.
- **Reimbursement for pre-closing payments:** If the seller paid any Lease Expenses before closing that relate to post-closing obligations (e.g., the seller advanced TI funds before the tenant took occupancy), the seller should be reimbursed at closing.
- **No exhibit requirement:** Resist buyer demands for a detailed exhibit of outstanding leasing costs. If the buyer insists, limit the exhibit to leasing costs payable within 12 months after closing.
- **Free rent allocation:** Free rent during the seller's period is the seller's loss (reduced income). Free rent during the buyer's period is the buyer's loss. This is consistent with the income proration approach and does not create a separate credit obligation. The Detailed Seller Side form (definition of "Lease Expenses") expressly excludes free rent loss from Lease Expenses.
- **Pipeline leases:** For leases under negotiation at closing, the seller should have no obligation for leasing costs unless the seller executed the lease without the buyer's required consent. If the buyer approved the lease and the seller executed it before closing, the leasing costs should be the buyer's responsibility.
- **Commission tail provisions:** Leasing commission agreements often contain "tail" provisions requiring commissions on renewals. The seller's position is that any renewal commission is the buyer's responsibility, as the buyer benefits from the renewal income.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer insists on credit for existing unfunded leasing costs:** This is the most heavily negotiated point. **Fallback chain:**
  1. **First fallback:** Agree to a credit for unfunded leasing costs under leases existing as of the effective date, but only for amounts due within 6 months after closing.
  2. **Second fallback:** Agree to a credit for all unfunded existing leasing costs as shown on an exhibit, but cap the total credit.
  3. **Third fallback:** Accept the UNICO Buyer Side approach (credit for all existing leasing costs, buyer pays new leasing costs), but require the buyer to assume responsibility for commission tail provisions on existing leases.
- **Buyer wants seller to escrow for in-process TI work:** **Fallback:** Accept an escrow (per the Seller Income Property form approach), but ensure: (a) the escrow amount is based on a mutually agreed budget, (b) excess funds are returned to the seller after completion, and (c) the buyer bears cost overruns.
- **Buyer argues purchase price was set assuming seller funds existing TI/LC:** This is the buyer's best argument. **Respond:** The purchase price was based on in-place NOI, which already accounts for the economic reality of the leases. The leasing costs produce the income the buyer is acquiring.

### Risk Assessment
- **Very high risk for the seller.** If the buyer successfully negotiates a credit for all unfunded existing leasing costs, the seller's net proceeds are reduced by millions of dollars on large office properties.
- **The negotiation outcome on this issue often depends on market conditions:** In a seller's market, the seller can typically maintain the Detailed Seller Side form position. In a buyer's market, the UNICO Buyer Side approach becomes more common.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office:** The highest stakes. TI/LC packages on institutional office leases can exceed $100/SF.
- **Industrial:** Lower per-SF costs. The seller's position is easier to maintain.
- **Retail:** Variable. Anchor TI packages can be significant.
- **Multifamily:** Not applicable (no TI/LC in the traditional sense).
- **Data Center:** Infrastructure contributions may be the functional equivalent of TI. Address these specifically.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant jurisdictional variation. This is a business and economic allocation issue.

## 12. Free Rent Periods

### Preferred Position
Free rent should not be treated as a separate proration item. Instead, the income proration naturally captures free rent: during a free rent period, there is no rent to prorate. Each party bears the lost income during its period of ownership. The seller should not give the buyer a credit for free rent that falls in the buyer's period, as the buyer's purchase price already reflects the anticipated cash flow (including any free rent periods).

**Cross-reference:** The Detailed Seller Side form (definition of "Lease Expenses") expressly excludes "loss of income resulting from any free rental period" from Lease Expenses, confirming that free rent is an income item, not a cost item.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **No separate credit:** Resist any buyer request for a separate free-rent credit at closing. The income proration handles free rent naturally.
- **Interaction with purchase price:** The purchase price is based on underwritten NOI, which should account for scheduled free rent. If the buyer underwrite free rent into its model, it has already been priced.
- **New leases with front-loaded free rent:** If the seller enters into a new lease during the contract period with significant front-loaded free rent, the buyer may argue the seller shifted economic burden. **Response:** The buyer approved the lease under the operating covenant, and the buyer's approval was informed by the full economic terms including the free rent schedule.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer wants a separate credit for free rent in the buyer's period:** **Reject.** The income proration addresses this. **Fallback:** If the buyer insists, agree to a purchase price reduction equal to the free rent loss, but only for free rent under leases entered into after the effective date that the buyer did not approve.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** if free rent is handled through the income proration.

### Asset-Type Variations
- See TI/LC section for asset-type-specific discussion.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant variation.

## 13. Post-Closing Reconciliation Mechanics

### Preferred Position
The post-closing reconciliation should be subject to strict deadlines and hard finality. The reconciliation should be completed within 60 days after closing for items determinable at that time, and within 60 days after calendar year-end for items requiring year-end data (operating expense true-ups). If a party fails to request an adjustment by written notice within the applicable period, the closing statement becomes final and binding. The seller's obligations under the proration provisions should survive for 6 months maximum. The buyer's audit rights should be limited to 6 months after closing.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 11.9) provides: "any adjustment shall be made, if at all, within 90 days after the Closing Date, and if a party fails to request an adjustment to the Closing Statement by a written notice delivered to the other party within the applicable period set forth above...then the allocations and prorations set forth in the Closing Statement shall be binding and conclusive against such party." The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(k)) provides for a 60-day reconciliation period with a 6-month survival for proration obligations.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Hard deadlines with finality:** This is the seller's most important reconciliation protection. Include language that the closing statement becomes "binding and conclusive" if no adjustment is requested within the stated period (per UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.9).
- **Short survival periods:** Limit the survival of proration obligations to 6 months (per the Detailed Seller Side form). This allows the seller entity to wind up within 6 months after closing.
- **Written notice requirement:** Require that any adjustment request be in writing, specify the items in dispute, and state the reasons for the adjustment (per UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.9). This prevents open-ended adjustment claims.
- **Limited audit rights:** Grant the buyer access to the seller's books and records for a limited period (6 months). The UNICO Seller Side form provides access "until final reconciliation." The seller should ensure the audit window closes with the reconciliation period.
- **No reopening:** Once the reconciliation is final (either by agreement or expiration of the adjustment period), it should be permanently closed. No party should be able to reopen prorations for subsequently discovered errors.
- **Seller entity dissolution:** The seller should be free to dissolve after the survival period expires. Include language that the buyer's sole recourse for post-survival claims is against any remaining assets of the seller entity (which will be none after dissolution).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer wants 12-month survival:** **Fallback:** Accept 9 months as a compromise, or 12 months for operating expense reconciliation only (since year-end data is needed), with 6 months for all other items.
- **Buyer wants 12-month audit rights:** **Fallback:** Accept 9 months maximum. Ensure the audit right terminates automatically with the survival period.
- **Buyer wants the right to reopen reconciliation for newly discovered errors:** **Reject.** Finality is essential. **Fallback:** Allow reopening only for errors exceeding $50,000 individually and only within the survival period.
- **Buyer wants an escrow holdback for reconciliation:** **Resist.** The survival of the proration obligations and the seller entity should be sufficient. **Fallback:** If the buyer insists, agree to a small escrow (e.g., $50,000-$100,000) that is released automatically at the end of the survival period if no claims are pending.
- **Buyer wants independent CPA dispute resolution:** **Accept** if necessary, as it is preferable to litigation. Specify that the CPA's determination is binding, the costs are shared equally, and the process must be completed within 60 days.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk.** The reconciliation period is when most post-closing proration disputes arise. Short deadlines and hard finality protect the seller.
- **Key risk:** If the seller entity dissolves before all reconciliation obligations are satisfied, the buyer has no recourse. Manage this by ensuring accurate prorations and prompt reconciliation.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Office:** Longest reconciliation periods may be needed due to operating expense complexity.
- **Industrial:** Short reconciliation periods (NNN simplicity).
- **Retail:** Longer periods for CAM and percentage rent true-ups.
- **Multifamily:** Short periods.
- **Data Center:** Medium periods for power cost reconciliation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- Survival periods may interact with applicable statutes of limitations. Ensure the contractual survival period is shorter than or equal to the statutory period.

## 14. Rent-Ready Adjustments and Vacancy Cost Allocation

### Preferred Position
The property is being sold "as-is" and the seller should have no obligation to deliver vacant spaces in any particular condition. The buyer has had the opportunity to inspect the property during due diligence and the purchase price reflects the condition of the property, including vacant spaces. No rent-ready credit or adjustment should be provided.

### Key Negotiation Points
- **"As-is" protection:** The seller's "as-is" provision should cover all property conditions, including vacant space conditions. The buyer's due diligence period is the time to evaluate and price any deferred maintenance.
- **No credit for existing vacancies:** The buyer priced existing vacancies into its offer. No credit should be given for conditions that were (or should have been) discovered during due diligence.
- **New vacancies during contract period:** If a tenant vacates during the contract period, the seller should have no obligation to restore the space. The buyer should rely on the operating covenant provisions (which require the buyer to approve lease terminations) for protection.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer demands rent-ready credits:** **Reject.** Cite the "as-is" provision. **Fallback:** If a tenant vacates during the contract period (i.e., after the buyer's due diligence and outside the buyer's control), agree to deliver the space in broom-clean condition, but no further.
- **Buyer wants seller to complete deferred maintenance:** **Reject.** All property conditions were available for inspection during due diligence.
- **Buyer argues new vacancy changes the deal economics:** **Respond:** The appropriate remedy is through the MAC (material adverse change) condition, not through a rent-ready proration.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** if the "as-is" provision is robust.
- **Medium risk** if a major tenant vacates during the contract period and the buyer demands concessions.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **All types:** The "as-is" position applies uniformly. The buyer's due diligence is the protection.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant variation.

## 15. Closing Costs Allocation

### Preferred Position

| Cost Item | Buyer | Seller |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Title insurance (standard owner's) | X | |
| Title insurance (extended/endorsements) | X | |
| Title examination / search costs | X | |
| Escrow fee | 50% | 50% |
| Transfer taxes / documentary stamps | 50% | 50% |
| Recording fees (deed) | X | |
| Survey costs | X | |
| Buyer's due diligence costs | X | |
| Seller's legal fees | | X |
| Buyer's legal fees | X | |

**Cross-reference:** The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 8.4(l)) makes the buyer pay "(i) all costs associated with its due diligence, (ii) all title insurance premiums and charges and all title examination costs, and (iii) all survey costs." Seller and buyer each pay half of "all escrow fees, transfer taxes and documentary stamp charges."

### Key Negotiation Points
- **Title insurance:** The seller's preferred position is that the buyer pays the full title premium (standard and extended). Many seller-side forms take this approach. The UNICO forms split this (seller pays standard, buyer pays extended).
- **Transfer taxes:** The seller's preferred position is a 50/50 split. In high-transfer-tax jurisdictions (NYC), this can save the seller millions. The buyer will push for seller-pays-all based on local custom.
- **Following local custom:** Include a catch-all provision: "All other customary purchase and sale closing costs shall be paid by Seller or Purchaser in accordance with the custom in the jurisdiction where the Property is located" (per Detailed Seller Side form). This provides flexibility based on local market.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer insists seller pay standard title premium:** **Fallback:** Accept the UNICO split (seller pays standard, buyer pays extended). This is common in western states.
- **Buyer insists seller pay all transfer taxes:** **Fallback:** Follow local custom. In states where the seller customarily pays (Washington, Oregon, many others), accept seller responsibility. In states where the custom is split or buyer-pays, maintain the 50/50 position.
- **Buyer wants seller to pay recording fees:** **Resist.** The buyer records the deed in its name and should bear the cost. **Fallback:** Accept as a minor concession.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk** in high-transfer-tax jurisdictions. On a $100M property in NYC, transfer taxes can exceed $2.6M. A 50/50 split saves the seller over $1.3M compared to seller-pays-all.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No significant variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York:** NYC RPT is typically the seller's obligation by custom. Mansion tax is the buyer's obligation. Mortgage recording tax may be partially avoidable through mortgage assignment. The NY Checklist places the commission on the seller.
- **Washington:** REET is the seller's obligation by statute and custom. The Seller Income Property form confirms this.
- **California:** Documentary transfer tax is typically the seller's obligation, though this is negotiable.
- **Colorado:** Low transfer taxes. Minimal impact.

## 17. Negotiation Priority Matrix (Seller Perspective)

| Priority | Item | Seller Economic Impact | Difficulty to Maintain |
|----------|------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | TI/LC -- buyer assumes all post-closing costs | Very High ($1M-$10M+) | Very High |
| 2 | Tax reassessment -- buyer bears all | High ($200K-$2M/year) | High |
| 3 | Reconciliation finality -- 60/90 day hard cutoff | High (closure risk) | Medium |
| 4 | Tenant reimbursement offset on tax/OpEx | High ($100K-$500K) | High |
| 5 | Transfer tax split (50/50 vs. seller-pays) | Medium-High ($100K-$2.6M) | Jurisdiction-dependent |
| 6 | Delinquent rent waterfall (5-tier vs. 3-tier) | Medium ($50K-$500K) | Low-Medium |
| 7 | Short survival period (6 months) | Medium (dissolution timing) | Medium |
| 8 | Limited audit rights (6 months) | Low-Medium (administrative) | Low-Medium |
| 9 | Rent-ready -- no credit (as-is) | Medium ($100K-$1M) | Low |
| 10 | Day-of-closing allocation | Low (~$16K/day on $100M) | Very Low |

*This playbook should be read in conjunction with the operating covenant provisions (which govern the seller's ability to enter into new leases during the contract period, directly affecting TI/LC allocation) and the representation and warranty provisions (which may affect the seller's exposure for proration-related claims post-closing). The seller should coordinate the proration survival period with the representation survival period to ensure consistent cutoff dates for all post-closing obligations.*
