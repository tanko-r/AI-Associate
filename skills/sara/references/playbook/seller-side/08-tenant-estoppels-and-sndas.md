## 1. Estoppel Delivery Requirements -- Which Tenants and What Thresholds

### Preferred Position

Seller should minimize estoppel requirements to reduce closing risk. The preferred position is a **percentage-based threshold only** (no "all Major Tenants" requirement), set at **70% of currently leased GLA**, with seller retaining the right to substitute Seller's Estoppel Certificates for non-responsive tenants. The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 7.1) sets the baseline: seller has a "commercially reasonable efforts" obligation to obtain estoppels, but estoppel receipt is **not** structured as a closing condition -- it is merely a covenant. No GLA threshold appears in the seller-side form because seller is not offering estoppels as a closing condition.

The detailed seller-side PSA (Section 6.1(a)(iv)) does concede estoppels as a closing condition but sets the threshold favorably: estoppels from "each Major Tenant" and Non-Major Tenants covering "at least seventy percent (70%) (by net rentable square feet)" of leased space (the "Estoppel Requirement"), with seller retaining the right to substitute Seller's Estoppel Certificates for up to one-half of Major Tenants (by number) and all Non-Major Tenants needed to satisfy the threshold.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Closing condition vs. covenant:** Seller's strongest position is that estoppel delivery is a **covenant only**, not a closing condition. The UNICO Seller Side form achieves this. If buyer insists on a closing condition (which most institutional buyers will), use the detailed seller-side PSA framework as the starting point.
- **Percentage threshold:** Start at 70% of GLA. Buyer will push for 80-90%. The 70% threshold in the detailed seller-side PSA is at the lower end of market. Accept 75-80% as a reasonable compromise; resist anything above 85%.
- **Major Tenant requirement:** Resist the "all Major Tenants" requirement. If it must be conceded, insist on seller's right to substitute Seller's Estoppel Certificates for up to one-half of Major Tenants (detailed seller-side PSA approach). Alternatively, define "Major Tenant" narrowly (only the top 1-2 tenants by GLA) to minimize the number of tenants for which estoppels are absolutely required.
- **GLA vs. rent denominator:** GLA-based thresholds are preferable for seller because they treat all square footage equally. Rent-based thresholds can skew the math: a small high-rent tenant's estoppel would have outsized importance. Resist rent-based thresholds.
- **Pre-study-period estoppels count:** The detailed seller-side PSA (Section 6.1(a)(iv)) provides that "all Tenant estoppel certificates provided to Purchaser before the end of the Study Period shall conclusively be deemed to count toward the satisfaction of the Estoppel Requirement." This is a powerful seller protection -- estoppels obtained early lock in toward the threshold regardless of subsequent events.
- **Calculation denominator:** Use "currently leased square footage" as the denominator (not total leasable square footage). This matches market practice and the UNICO forms.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Starting position and concession chain:**
1. **Best position:** Estoppels as covenant only, no closing condition, commercially reasonable efforts standard
2. **First concession:** Estoppels as closing condition at 70% of GLA, with unlimited Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitution and pre-study-period estoppels counting
3. **Second concession:** 75% of GLA, with Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitution for up to one-half of Major Tenants and all Non-Major Tenants
4. **Third concession:** 80% of GLA, with Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitution for Non-Major Tenants only (capped at 10-15% of GLA)
5. **Maximum concession:** 85% of GLA, 100% of Major Tenants, with limited Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitution (5-10% of GLA for Non-Major Tenants only)

Buyer will push for 100% of Major Tenants as a hard requirement. Resist by: (a) pointing out that seller cannot control tenant behavior, (b) offering the Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitute, and (c) proposing a closing extension mechanism as an alternative to termination.

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk to seller:** Accepting 100% of Major Tenants as a hard closing condition with no Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitute and no closing extension. A single uncooperative tenant can kill the deal.
- **Medium risk to seller:** Accepting 80% GLA threshold with Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitution rights. Seller has flexibility to manage non-responsive tenants.
- **Low risk to seller:** Estoppels as a covenant only, or closing condition at 70% with full substitution rights.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office (multi-tenant):** Percentage thresholds work well. Push for GLA-based measurement.
- **Industrial (few tenants):** Be cautious with percentage thresholds -- losing one tenant's estoppel may cause a significant GLA shortfall. Consider absolute number thresholds instead (e.g., "estoppels from at least X out of Y tenants").
- **Retail:** Anchor tenant estoppels are difficult to obtain from national chains. Build in Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitution specifically for anchor tenants or accept that lease-form estoppels will be used.
- **Multifamily:** Resist any estoppel requirements for residential tenants. Offer a certified rent roll instead. Accept estoppel requirements only for commercial tenants within the property.
- **Data Center:** Hyperscale tenants are sophisticated and generally cooperative with estoppel requests, but their legal review process is slow. Build in adequate time and extension rights.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** NY buyers are typically aggressive on estoppel requirements. The NY Checklist (Practical Law) recommends buyer obtain estoppels from every tenant plus Major Tenant-specific estoppels. Anticipate strong buyer pushback on lower thresholds.
- **Oregon:** The Meadows form demonstrates a seller-favorable approach -- estoppels required only from two named tenants. This level of specificity is achievable in smaller tenant-count deals.
- **Colorado:** The detailed seller-side PSA uses the 70% threshold with substantial Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitution rights, which is market for institutional deals in Colorado.
- **California:** California buyers tend to be aggressive. Expect pushback on anything below 80%.

## 2. Estoppel Form Requirements

### Preferred Position

Seller should control the estoppel form by **attaching it as an exhibit to the PSA** and requiring that the attached form (or the tenant's lease-required form) be the only acceptable format. This prevents buyer from demanding a more extensive form post-signing.

The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 7.1) provides: "estoppel certificates from each of the Tenants in the form attached hereto as Exhibit K (or such other form that complies with the terms of the Tenant's Lease)." This is the correct approach -- seller's attached form is the default, with the lease-form as an acceptable alternative.

Key form principles for seller:
1. **Keep the form concise:** The fewer items, the faster tenants will sign. The detailed seller-side PSA Exhibit B has only 9 items (vs. the UNICO Buyer Side Exhibit K with 14 items).
2. **Knowledge qualifiers:** Include "to the best of our knowledge" qualifiers on default, offset, and claims items.
3. **General reservations:** Include language permitting tenants to add "we reserve all rights" or "subject to our audit rights as set forth in the Lease" without rendering the estoppel nonconforming. The detailed seller-side PSA (Section 6.1(a)(iv)) expressly provides that buyer "shall have no right to object to an estoppel certificate solely because it limits one or more statements to the best of the tenant's knowledge or contains a general conditional statement such as 'we reserve all rights' or 'subject to our audit rights as set forth in the Lease.'"
4. **No lease copy attachment requirement:** Resist buyer's request to require tenants to attach complete lease copies. This slows execution and some tenants will refuse.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Exhibit attachment at signing:** Both buyer and seller benefit from having the form agreed upon at PSA execution. This avoids post-signing disputes about form adequacy.
- **"Substantially in the form":** Always use "substantially in the form" language (not "in the form") to preserve flexibility for minor tenant modifications. Both UNICO forms and the Meadows form use this standard.
- **Lease-form priority:** If the lease specifies a particular estoppel form or required content, that form should govern. Arguing that the lease-form estoppel is insufficient creates an impossible position for seller -- seller cannot force the tenant to provide more than the lease requires.
- **Government tenant carve-out:** Always include a carve-out for government tenants: "in connection with any Lease to a governmental body, then an estoppel certificate or confirmation letter or similar instrument in such governmental body's customary form shall be deemed to satisfy the requirement" (detailed seller-side PSA, Section 6.1(a)(iv)). Government tenants will not use any form other than their own.
- **National credit tenant forms:** Major credit tenants (Fortune 500 companies, national retailers) often have their own corporate estoppel forms. Include a provision that a tenant's own form is acceptable if it covers the "core" estoppel items (lease identification, term, rent, defaults, and security deposit).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Starting position and concession chain:**
1. **Best position:** Seller's concise attached form is the exclusive form; knowledge qualifiers and general reservations expressly permitted
2. **First concession:** Seller's form or lease-form; government and national credit tenant forms accepted automatically
3. **Second concession:** Seller's form or lease-form or buyer's form; any form accepted if it covers core items (5-6 minimum items)
4. **Third concession:** Buyer's more detailed form as the default, but tenant's lease-form or own corporate form is acceptable
5. **Maximum concession:** Buyer's detailed form with 14+ items as the only acceptable form -- resist this strongly

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk to seller:** Accepting buyer's detailed 14-item form as the exclusive acceptable format. Complex forms slow tenant execution and increase the risk of estoppels not being returned by deadline.
- **Medium risk to seller:** Accepting buyer's form as the default with lease-form alternatives. Most institutional leases contain estoppel forms that cover core items.
- **Low risk to seller:** Seller's form attached as exhibit with lease-form and government/credit-tenant carve-outs.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** National retailers will insist on their own forms. Include automatic acceptance language for any form from a tenant with a national or regional chain of 50+ locations.
- **Office:** Corporate tenants generally sign the landlord's form with minor modifications.
- **Industrial:** Few-tenant properties allow more time to work with each tenant on form requirements.
- **Multifamily:** No form needed for residential tenants.
- **Data Center:** Hyperscale tenants have their own forms; include automatic acceptance for data center operators with revenue exceeding $1B.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Attach the form at signing to comply with NY practice of submitting all closing documents in advance.
- **All jurisdictions:** Ensure the estoppel form does not ask for information that the lease does not require the tenant to provide. If the lease's estoppel cooperation clause is limited to specific items, the PSA form should not exceed those items.

## 3. Minimum Content Requirements for Estoppels

### Preferred Position

Seller should define the minimum content requirements as narrowly as possible to maximize the likelihood that tenant-returned estoppels will qualify as "conforming." The detailed seller-side PSA Exhibit B includes 9 items, which is the seller's preferred level of detail:

1. Lease identification and amendments
2. Lease in full force and effect
3. No offsets or defenses (to best of knowledge)
4. Tenant has accepted possession
5. Landlord improvements completed in all material respects
6. Lease term (commencement and expiration)
7. Base rent amount and date paid through; no advance rent beyond 30 days
8. Security deposit amount
9. No defaults by either party (to best of knowledge)

**Items seller should resist including in the minimum requirements:**
- Purchase options or rights of first refusal (this information is in the lease itself)
- Expansion rights (ditto)
- Assignment/sublease status (buyer can verify through lease review and property inspection)
- Detailed TI completion certification (too much detail invites tenant qualifications)
- Detailed reliance language naming specific lenders (the generic "Purchaser and each Lender" reliance language in the detailed seller-side PSA is sufficient)

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Knowledge qualifiers on defaults and claims:** The detailed seller-side PSA's form uses "to the best of our knowledge" for defaults and offsets. This is critical for seller because it reduces the risk that a tenant will refuse to sign an estoppel that makes an unqualified representation about complex legal matters.
- **General reservations accepted:** The detailed seller-side PSA expressly states that buyer cannot object to an estoppel solely because it includes "we reserve all rights" or "subject to our audit rights." This provision should be included in every seller-side PSA.
- **No lease copy attachment:** Resist requiring tenants to attach a complete copy of the lease and all amendments. Seller should instead represent that the lease schedule attached to the PSA is complete and accurate -- this puts the lease-completeness issue in seller's reps rather than burdening tenants.
- **"Material" qualifier on landlord obligations:** Item 5 (landlord improvements completed) should be qualified by "in all material respects" to avoid technical objections.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Buyer will push for additional content items (purchase options, expansion rights, sublease identification, detailed TI certification).

**Starting position and concession chain:**
1. **Best position:** 9-item form per detailed seller-side PSA Exhibit B, with knowledge qualifiers and reservations
2. **First concession:** Add purchase option disclosure item (reasonable since this affects buyer's long-term ownership)
3. **Second concession:** Add sublease/assignment identification (reasonable since buyer needs to know who occupies the space)
4. **Third concession:** Add expansion right disclosure
5. **Maximum concession:** Full 14-item form per UNICO Buyer Side Exhibit K -- but insist on knowledge qualifiers for items 7-8 (defaults/offsets) and general reservation acceptance language

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk to seller:** Concise 9-item form with knowledge qualifiers. Tenants are more likely to sign quickly.
- **Medium risk to seller:** 12-14 item form. More items means more opportunity for tenants to add qualifications, which may render the estoppel nonconforming.
- **High risk to seller:** Extensive form requiring lease copy attachments, detailed TI certification, and unqualified representations on all items. This form will delay tenant execution and increase the risk of nonconforming responses.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** Accept that estoppels may need to address co-tenancy, exclusive use, and percentage rent because these items are critical to the property's valuation and buyer's lender will require them.
- **Office:** The 9-item form is sufficient for most office tenants.
- **Industrial:** Buyer may need environmental use confirmation from industrial tenants; concede this if the lease imposes environmental obligations on the tenant.
- **Data Center:** Power and cooling allocation items may be necessary; concede these as they are unique to the asset class.
- **Multifamily:** No content requirements for residential tenants.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** The minimum content requirements should be limited to what the tenant can be compelled to provide under the lease's estoppel cooperation clause. If the lease only requires the tenant to certify 5 items, seller should not be penalized for obtaining only those 5 items.

## 4. Estoppel Delivery Deadline

### Preferred Position

Seller should maximize flexibility on the delivery timeline while minimizing the consequences of delayed delivery. The preferred approach:

1. **Draft delivery:** Seller delivers drafts within 3 business days after the effective date (UNICO Seller Side form, Section 7.1 -- shorter than the buyer side's 10 business days)
2. **Buyer review:** Buyer has 3 business days to review drafts (UNICO Seller Side -- shorter than the buyer side's 10 business days). Buyer "shall be deemed to have approved" if it does not timely object.
3. **Delivery deadline:** A specific date set in Section 1 of the PSA (the "Estoppel Deadline"), well in advance of closing, giving seller time to pursue non-responsive tenants and, if necessary, prepare Seller's Estoppel Certificates
4. **Pre-closing delivery window:** Estoppels delivered no later than 3-5 business days before closing (not 10 as buyer prefers)

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Short buyer review period:** The UNICO Seller Side form gives buyer only 3 business days to review drafts (vs. 10 on the buyer side). This is seller-favorable because it accelerates the process and invokes deemed approval sooner.
- **Deemed approval:** Both UNICO forms include deemed approval if buyer does not timely object. This is critical for seller -- it prevents buyer from sitting on drafts and then claiming they are deficient.
- **Forwarding obligation:** Seller should forward executed estoppels within 2 business days of receipt. This is market per both UNICO forms.
- **Estoppel deadline vs. closing date:** The Estoppel Deadline should be set earlier than the closing date to give seller time to prepare Seller's Estoppel Certificates if needed.
- **No refreshment obligation:** Resist any obligation to refresh or update estoppels that become stale due to closing extensions. If the estoppel was conforming when delivered, it should remain conforming regardless of closing date changes. The detailed seller-side PSA's provision deeming pre-study-period estoppels as permanently counting supports this position.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Starting position and concession chain:**
1. **Best position:** 3-day buyer review, 3-5 day pre-closing delivery, no refresh obligation, pre-study-period estoppels count permanently
2. **First concession:** 5-day buyer review, 5-day pre-closing delivery
3. **Second concession:** 7-day buyer review, 7-day pre-closing delivery
4. **Third concession:** 10-day buyer review, 10-day pre-closing delivery (UNICO Buyer Side standard)
5. **Maximum concession:** 10-day buyer review, 10-day pre-closing delivery, with refresh obligation for estoppels older than 60 days at closing

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk to seller:** Short review periods with deemed approval. Seller controls the timeline.
- **Medium risk to seller:** Longer review periods (7-10 days) that give buyer more time to find objections.
- **High risk to seller:** Refresh obligations that require seller to obtain new estoppels if closing is extended. This is a significant burden, particularly with non-cooperative tenants.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The delivery timeline is generally asset-type agnostic, though properties with more tenants need earlier start dates.
- **Retail:** National chain corporate offices may require 30+ days to process estoppels. Start the process immediately after PSA execution.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** NY buyers expect 10-business-day pre-closing delivery. Plan for this in NY transactions.
- **West Coast:** 5-7 business days pre-closing is typical in CA, OR, and WA.

## 5. Consequences of Non-Delivery

### Preferred Position

Seller's preferred position is that estoppel non-delivery is **not a closing condition** and does not give buyer any termination right. The UNICO Seller Side form achieves this: estoppels are a seller covenant ("Seller shall make commercially reasonable efforts") but are not listed among buyer's closing conditions (Section 10). Seller is expressly protected: "Seller shall not be in default if any Tenant does not execute and deliver an estoppel certificate."

If forced to concede estoppels as a closing condition, seller should build in the following protections:

1. **Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitution:** Seller may substitute Seller's Estoppel Certificates to meet the threshold (see Section 6 below)
2. **Seller's extension right:** Seller may extend closing by up to 14-30 days to continue pursuing estoppels (the detailed seller-side PSA allows up to 60 days total)
3. **No seller default:** Failure to obtain estoppels is not a seller default, so buyer cannot pursue default remedies (damages, specific performance) -- buyer's sole remedy is termination
4. **Pre-study-period estoppels lock in:** Estoppels delivered during due diligence count permanently toward the threshold
5. **Cure period before termination:** Buyer must give seller notice of the failure and a cure period (5 business days per the UNICO Buyer Side form) before terminating

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Closing condition with safety valves:** If seller must concede a closing condition, the detailed seller-side PSA framework is the model. It combines a 70% threshold with Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitution, pre-study-period lock-in, and a 60-day extension right. This gives seller ample tools to satisfy the condition.
- **"Sole remedy" language:** If buyer has a termination right for estoppel failure, specify that termination and deposit return are buyer's **sole and exclusive remedy**. Buyer should not be able to pursue damages for seller's failure to obtain estoppels.
- **Deposit return vs. retention:** If buyer terminates for estoppel failure, the earnest money deposit should be returned to buyer. Do not try to retain the deposit on an estoppel failure -- this would likely be overturned and creates litigation risk.
- **Interaction with "going hard":** If the deposit goes hard after due diligence, the estoppel termination right must be carved out. Seller cannot have the deposit go hard AND deny buyer a termination right for estoppel failure -- this would leave buyer trapped.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Starting position and concession chain:**
1. **Best position:** Estoppels as covenant only, no closing condition, no buyer termination right, seller not in default
2. **First concession:** Estoppels as closing condition at 70%, with unlimited Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitution and 60-day extension
3. **Second concession:** Estoppels as closing condition at 75%, with Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitution (one-half of Major Tenants + all Non-Major Tenants) and 30-day extension
4. **Third concession:** Estoppels as closing condition at 80%, with limited Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitution (Non-Major Tenants only, 10% GLA cap) and 14-day extension
5. **Maximum concession:** Estoppels as closing condition at 80-85%, 100% of Major Tenants required (no substitute), limited Seller's Estoppel Certificate for others, 14-day extension, buyer termination right if not met

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk to seller:** Covenant-only approach. Seller has no closing risk from estoppels.
- **Medium risk to seller:** Closing condition with robust substitution rights, extensions, and pre-study-period lock-in.
- **High risk to seller:** Closing condition at 80%+ with limited substitution and short extensions.
- **Critical risk to seller:** Closing condition at 85%+ with 100% Major Tenant requirement, no substitution, and no extension. A single uncooperative tenant can terminate the deal.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Single-tenant:** The sole tenant's estoppel will inevitably be a closing condition. Seller should negotiate a Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitute if the tenant is slow to respond, with a closing extension.
- **Retail (anchor-dependent):** Anchor tenant estoppels are typically required. Build in ample extension time because national retailers are notoriously slow.
- **Office (multi-tenant):** Percentage-based approach with substitution rights works well.
- **Industrial:** With fewer tenants, each estoppel has more weight. Build in longer extensions.
- **Data Center:** Hyperscale tenant estoppels will be required. Build in 30+ day extension specifically for data center tenant response times.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** NY courts enforce termination rights strictly. Ensure the PSA clearly states the consequences and sole remedy language.
- **Colorado:** The detailed seller-side PSA (Denver property) provides the most comprehensive seller-protective framework.
- **Oregon:** The UNICO Seller Side form (OR property) demonstrates the covenant-only approach without a closing condition.

## 6. Seller's Estoppel Certificate as Substitute

### Preferred Position

Seller's Estoppel Certificate is the single most important seller protection in the estoppel framework. Seller should insist on **broad substitution rights** with the following parameters:

1. **Scope:** Seller may substitute Seller's Estoppel Certificates for up to one-half (by number) of Major Tenants and all Non-Major Tenants necessary to satisfy the Estoppel Requirement (detailed seller-side PSA, Section 6.1(a)(iv))
2. **Form:** Seller's Estoppel Certificate should be substantially in the form of Exhibit B-1 of the detailed seller-side PSA, which includes critical seller protections:
   - Liability subject to all time, dollar, and other limitations on seller's liability in the PSA
   - Knowledge qualifiers ("to Seller's knowledge")
   - No personal liability for officers, directors, owners, managers, trustees, or agents
   - Representations limited by buyer's own knowledge and the PSA's terms
3. **Post-closing pursuit:** Seller retains the right to continue pursuing tenant estoppels after closing. If the tenant later delivers an estoppel consistent with the Seller's Estoppel Certificate, seller is released from liability under the Seller's Estoppel Certificate to that extent (detailed seller-side PSA, Section 6.1(a)(iv))
4. **Survival:** Seller's Estoppel Certificate liability should be subject to the same survival period and cap as seller's other representations and warranties

### Key Negotiation Points

- **The substitute is not a guarantee:** A Seller's Estoppel Certificate is seller's best knowledge of the lease status, not an unconditional guarantee. All knowledge qualifiers from the PSA's rep framework should apply.
- **Dollar cap:** Seller's aggregate liability under Seller's Estoppel Certificates should be subject to the PSA's general indemnification cap (typically 1-3% of purchase price). Do not allow buyer to uncap Seller's Estoppel Certificate liability.
- **Release mechanism:** The post-closing tenant estoppel delivery / seller release mechanism is critical. If the tenant eventually delivers an estoppel confirming the information in the Seller's Estoppel Certificate, seller should be fully released. If the tenant's estoppel reveals a variance, seller remains liable only for the variance.
- **Buyer's lender acceptance:** Seller should not warrant that buyer's lender will accept Seller's Estoppel Certificates. If buyer's lender refuses to accept them, that is buyer's financing risk (in a no-financing-contingency deal).
- **Major Tenant substitution limit:** The detailed seller-side PSA allows substitution for "up to one-half (by number)" of Major Tenants. This is aggressive but defensible. Buyer will push for no Major Tenant substitution. The compromise is typically: Seller may substitute for 1 out of 3 Major Tenants (or, for properties with many Major Tenants, up to 25-33% by number).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Starting position and concession chain:**
1. **Best position:** Unlimited substitution for all tenants, knowledge qualifiers, dollar cap, post-closing release
2. **First concession:** Substitution for one-half of Major Tenants and all Non-Major Tenants
3. **Second concession:** Substitution for one-third of Major Tenants and all Non-Major Tenants
4. **Third concession:** No Major Tenant substitution; substitution for Non-Major Tenants up to 15% of GLA
5. **Maximum concession:** No Major Tenant substitution; substitution for Non-Major Tenants up to 10% of GLA, with extended survival (double the general rep survival)

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk to seller:** Broad substitution rights with knowledge qualifiers, dollar cap, and post-closing release. Seller's estoppel exposure is limited and manageable.
- **Medium risk to seller:** No Major Tenant substitution with Non-Major Tenant substitution. Seller bears the risk of Major Tenant non-cooperation without a safety valve.
- **High risk to seller:** No substitution rights at all. Seller is entirely dependent on tenant cooperation for closing.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Single-tenant:** Seller's Estoppel Certificate is critical because there is no diversification. Buyer will resist strongly but seller has few alternatives if the tenant is slow.
- **Retail:** Include specific language that Seller's Estoppel Certificates may cover co-tenancy, exclusive use, and percentage rent matters in addition to standard items.
- **Office:** Standard Seller's Estoppel Certificate form per Exhibit B-1.
- **Industrial:** Same as single-tenant for single-tenant industrial. For multi-tenant, standard approach.
- **Data Center:** Seller's Estoppel Certificates should cover power and cooling commitments.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Colorado:** The detailed seller-side PSA (Exhibit B-1) provides the market template for Seller's Estoppel Certificates.
- **Oregon:** The UNICO Seller Side form does not include a separate Seller's Estoppel Certificate form. Consider adding one.
- **New York:** NY buyers will resist Seller's Estoppel Certificates aggressively. Be prepared for extended negotiation on the form and scope.

## 7. Material Variance in Estoppel

### Preferred Position

Seller should define "material variance" narrowly and limit the consequences of a variance. The preferred framework:

1. **What counts toward the threshold:** An estoppel counts toward the Estoppel Requirement unless it (a) discloses a material default by seller "not within Purchaser's Knowledge as of the end of the Study Period" or (b) contains information inconsistent with the Lease Schedule or Leases "unless such inconsistency (i) was disclosed to Purchaser before the end of the Study Period or (ii) cannot reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect following the Closing" (detailed seller-side PSA, Section 6.1(a)(iv))
2. **Deemed modification of reps:** If any tenant estoppel contains information inconsistent with a Seller Representation, "the Seller Representation shall be deemed modified by the information contained in such estoppel certificate" (detailed seller-side PSA, Section 6.1(a)(iv)). This is the most powerful seller protection -- estoppel information automatically updates seller's reps, eliminating any misrepresentation claim.
3. **Cure of defaults:** An estoppel that discloses a "landlord default" counts toward the threshold if seller cures the default at or before closing (detailed seller-side PSA, Section 6.1(a)(iv))
4. **Short objection window:** Buyer must object to a non-qualifying estoppel within 2 business days (detailed seller-side PSA) -- failure to timely object results in deemed approval

### Key Negotiation Points

- **"Deemed modification" is the crown jewel:** This provision means that if a tenant's estoppel reveals information different from seller's reps, seller's reps are automatically updated -- buyer cannot claim a misrepresentation. Fight hard to retain this.
- **Knowledge qualifier on "material default":** The default must not be "within Purchaser's Knowledge" to disqualify an estoppel. This means buyer cannot use an estoppel to re-raise issues buyer already knew about during due diligence.
- **Material Adverse Effect threshold:** Requiring that inconsistencies "reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect" sets a high bar. Minor discrepancies (slight rent differences, immaterial date errors) do not disqualify estoppels.
- **Short objection window:** 2 business days forces buyer to be disciplined and prevents buyer from warehousing objections. The UNICO Buyer Side form gives buyer 5 business days -- resist any window longer than 3 business days.
- **Cure right:** Seller should always have the right to cure any landlord default disclosed in an estoppel before closing. If cured, the estoppel counts. The detailed seller-side PSA provides this.
- **No price adjustment:** Resist any provision allowing buyer to demand a purchase price reduction based on estoppel variances. Buyer's remedy should be limited to termination (if the variance is truly material) or close-as-is.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Starting position and concession chain:**
1. **Best position:** Deemed modification of reps, Material Adverse Effect threshold, 2-day objection window, cure right, no price adjustment
2. **First concession:** Deemed modification of reps plus buyer termination right only for variances constituting a Material Adverse Effect
3. **Second concession:** No deemed modification, but buyer termination right limited to Material Adverse Effect variances; seller cure right for defaults; 3-day objection window
4. **Third concession:** Buyer termination right for "material" variances (defined by dollar thresholds); seller 14-day cure period; 5-day objection window (UNICO Buyer Side approach)
5. **Maximum concession:** Buyer termination right for any material inconsistency with due diligence materials; seller cure period; buyer may also close with price adjustment for quantifiable variances

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk to seller:** Deemed modification plus Material Adverse Effect threshold. Seller is well-protected from estoppel-related claims.
- **Medium risk to seller:** Buyer termination right for Material Adverse Effect with seller cure period. Seller has a meaningful opportunity to fix issues before buyer can terminate.
- **High risk to seller:** Buyer termination right for any "material" variance without Material Adverse Effect threshold or deemed modification. The definition of "material" becomes the battleground.
- **Critical risk to seller:** Buyer has both termination right AND price adjustment right for estoppel variances. This gives buyer a windfall if variances are discovered.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** Co-tenancy and exclusive use variances can constitute Material Adverse Effects. Be prepared to cure co-tenancy violations before closing if disclosed in estoppels.
- **Office:** Rent and term variances are the most common. Immaterial date discrepancies should not be treated as variances.
- **Industrial:** Environmental use disclosures in estoppels warrant careful attention.
- **Data Center:** Power and cooling specification variances may constitute Material Adverse Effects.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** NY courts will enforce the "deemed modification" provision if clearly drafted.
- **Colorado:** The detailed seller-side PSA framework is well-established in Colorado practice.
- **California:** CA courts may scrutinize "deemed modification" provisions under general contract unconscionability doctrines. Ensure the provision is clearly negotiated and not buried.

## 8. Estoppel Dating Requirements

### Preferred Position

Seller should push for the **most flexible dating requirements possible**:

1. **No specific dating requirement:** Estoppels are acceptable if they were current and accurate when executed, regardless of how much time has elapsed
2. **Pre-study-period lock-in:** All estoppels delivered to buyer before the end of the study period "conclusively" count toward the Estoppel Requirement (detailed seller-side PSA, Section 6.1(a)(iv)). This is the strongest seller position -- once an estoppel is delivered, it counts permanently.
3. **No refresh obligation:** Seller has no obligation to re-obtain or update estoppels if closing is extended, regardless of the reason for extension

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Pre-study-period lock-in is critical:** This provision prevents buyer from arguing that estoppels obtained early in the process are "stale." Seller must fight for this because re-obtaining estoppels is time-consuming, expensive, and may yield different (worse) results if tenant circumstances have changed.
- **Resist the 30-day requirement:** Buyer will push for estoppels dated within 30 days of closing (per the NY Checklist). This is extremely burdensome for seller because it requires precise timing and may force seller to restart the estoppel process if closing is delayed.
- **Refresh as buyer's problem:** If buyer extends closing (e.g., for financing reasons), any resulting staleness is buyer's problem, not seller's.
- **Extension interaction:** If SELLER extends closing (e.g., for title cure or estoppel pursuit), seller should not be required to refresh previously obtained estoppels. The extension is for the purpose of obtaining missing estoppels, not re-obtaining existing ones.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Starting position and concession chain:**
1. **Best position:** No dating requirement; pre-study-period lock-in; no refresh obligation
2. **First concession:** Estoppels dated within 60 days of closing; pre-study-period estoppels count if seller provides a bring-down certificate
3. **Second concession:** Estoppels dated within 45 days of closing; pre-study-period estoppels count with seller bring-down
4. **Third concession:** Estoppels dated within 30 days of closing; no pre-study-period lock-in
5. **Maximum concession:** 30-day requirement plus refresh obligation on extension -- unacceptable unless deal terms otherwise strongly favor seller

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk to seller:** No dating requirement with pre-study-period lock-in. Maximum flexibility.
- **Medium risk to seller:** 45-60 day requirement. Achievable on most deals with proper timing.
- **High risk to seller:** 30-day requirement with refresh obligation. Forces seller to manage estoppel timing precisely and may require restarting the process if closing is delayed.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Dating requirements are generally asset-type agnostic. The key variable is the number of tenants -- more tenants means more difficulty timing all estoppels within a narrow window.
- **Retail:** National retailers may take 30-45 days to process estoppels, making a 30-day dating requirement very tight if closing is scheduled shortly after estoppel receipt.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** The NY Checklist's 30-day standard is well-established in NY practice but is not a legal requirement. Push for 45-60 days in NY.
- **West Coast:** 45-day dating is more common and accepted on the West Coast.

## 9. SNDA Requirements -- Seller's Perspective

### Preferred Position

Seller should minimize SNDA obligations. The preferred approach mirrors the UNICO Seller Side form (Section 9.3) and the Seller-income-property form (Section 8):

1. **Cooperation only, no obligation:** "At no cost or expense to Seller, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer's efforts to obtain financing." This frames the SNDA obligation as buyer's responsibility, with seller merely cooperating.
2. **No closing condition:** SNDAs should never be a closing condition in a no-financing-contingency deal. The UNICO Buyer Side form states: "Buyer's ability to obtain financing for the acquisition of the Property is not a condition to Buyer's obligation to close." This eliminates any basis for SNDA closing conditions.
3. **Lease enforcement limitation:** The UNICO Seller Side form limits enforcement to "enforcing such requirements for estoppel certificates and SNDAs to the extent the same may be required under the Leases (but without any need to file claims or incur substantial costs)." Seller should not be required to litigate or spend significant money.
4. **Cost allocation to buyer:** All SNDA-related costs (preparation, negotiation, recording) should be borne by buyer.
5. **No obligation to negotiate SNDA terms:** Seller cooperates in requesting SNDAs but does not negotiate the SNDA terms between buyer's lender and the tenants.

The Seller-income-property form takes an even more limited position: seller agrees to cooperate "provided said tenants' leases permit the landlord to request a subordination agreement" and "Seller shall have no obligation to obtain and deliver any such subordination agreements to Buyer."

### Key Negotiation Points

- **No-financing-contingency shield:** Since the deal has no financing contingency, seller's strongest argument against SNDA obligations is that buyer assumed the risk of financing. Any SNDA failure is buyer's problem.
- **Lease enforcement only:** If the lease requires the tenant to cooperate with SNDAs, seller should be willing to request (not demand) cooperation. If the lease does not require SNDA cooperation, seller has no basis to compel the tenant and should not be obligated to try.
- **Timing:** SNDAs should be requested concurrently with estoppels to avoid delay, but their non-delivery should not delay or condition closing.
- **Seller not responsible for lender-tenant negotiation:** The SNDA negotiation between buyer's lender and the tenant is a bilateral process that seller should not be in the middle of. Seller facilitates the introduction; buyer and lender handle the rest.
- **No indemnification for SNDA failure:** Seller should not indemnify buyer for any losses resulting from failure to obtain SNDAs.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Starting position and concession chain:**
1. **Best position:** Cooperation only, no obligation, no closing condition, buyer bears all costs
2. **First concession:** "Commercially reasonable efforts" to request SNDAs from tenants whose leases require cooperation; no closing condition; buyer bears costs
3. **Second concession:** Same as above, plus seller facilitates introductions between lender and tenant counsel
4. **Third concession:** Seller uses commercially reasonable efforts to obtain SNDAs from Major Tenants; no closing condition; costs split
5. **Maximum concession:** Seller uses good faith efforts to obtain SNDAs from all tenants identified by buyer's lender; SNDAs from Major Tenants as a closing condition -- avoid this if at all possible

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk to seller:** Cooperation only, no closing condition. Seller has no SNDA-related closing risk.
- **Medium risk to seller:** Commercially reasonable efforts with lease enforcement. Seller may need to send default notices to non-cooperative tenants.
- **High risk to seller:** SNDAs as a closing condition for Major Tenants. This gives each Major Tenant (and its counsel) effective veto power over the closing.
- **Critical risk to seller:** SNDAs as a closing condition for all tenants. This is unacceptable in any multi-tenant deal.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** Anchor tenant SNDAs can be extremely difficult to obtain. National retailers' legal departments are slow and insist on their own SNDA forms with extensive modifications. Do not accept SNDA closing conditions for retail anchor tenants.
- **Office:** Credit tenant SNDAs are important to buyers but should not be seller's closing risk.
- **Industrial:** Single-tenant SNDA may be required by lender. Seller should cooperate but not guarantee delivery.
- **Data Center:** Hyperscale tenant SNDAs are critical to financing. Seller should cooperate actively given the importance to deal certainty.
- **Multifamily:** No SNDA issues for residential tenants. Commercial tenant SNDAs handled on a case-by-case basis.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** The NY Checklist specifically addresses SNDA requirements from the buyer's perspective. Anticipate aggressive buyer demands.
- **Oregon:** Neither the UNICO Seller Side form nor the Meadows form addresses SNDAs as a closing condition.
- **All jurisdictions:** There is no statutory obligation on a seller/landlord to obtain SNDAs from tenants. The obligation is entirely contractual under the PSA and, potentially, under lease provisions.

## 10. SNDA Form and Negotiation -- Seller's Perspective

### Preferred Position

Seller should have **no involvement** in SNDA form selection or negotiation. The SNDA is an agreement between buyer's lender and the tenant -- seller is not a party to it. Seller's role is limited to:

1. Facilitating the request to the tenant
2. Providing contact information for tenant legal departments
3. Forwarding the SNDA form from buyer's lender to the tenant (or authorizing buyer/lender to contact the tenant directly)

### Key Negotiation Points

- **No seller approval of SNDA form:** Seller should not be required to approve the lender's SNDA form. This avoids seller being drawn into disputes about SNDA terms.
- **No seller amendment of SNDA form:** If the tenant requests modifications to the SNDA form, seller should not be the negotiating party. Buyer and its lender should negotiate directly with the tenant.
- **Recording costs to buyer:** All SNDA recording costs should be buyer's responsibility.
- **Seller consent provisions in leases:** Some leases require landlord consent to an SNDA. Seller should agree to provide consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) but should not be obligated to consent to SNDA terms that adversely affect seller's interests (e.g., an SNDA that modifies lease terms or expands tenant rights beyond the lease).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

Buyer will push for seller involvement in facilitating SNDA negotiation, particularly for tenants with whom seller has a relationship.

**Starting position and concession chain:**
1. **Best position:** No involvement; provide contact information only
2. **First concession:** Forward lender's SNDA form to tenant and facilitate introduction
3. **Second concession:** Participate in calls between lender and tenant counsel regarding SNDA terms
4. **Maximum concession:** Actively facilitate SNDA negotiation, including seller's counsel participating in markup review -- only if buyer reimburses seller's legal costs

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk to seller:** No involvement in SNDA form or negotiation.
- **Medium risk to seller:** Facilitating introductions and forwarding forms. Minimal time and cost.
- **High risk to seller:** Active participation in SNDA negotiation. Creates time burden and potential liability if seller mishandles the process.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Seller's involvement in SNDA negotiation is generally the same across asset types. The key variable is tenant sophistication -- more sophisticated tenants require less seller involvement.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** No jurisdictional variations on seller's SNDA negotiation role.

## 11. Closing Extension Rights for Estoppel/SNDA Delivery -- Seller's Perspective

### Preferred Position

Seller should have **broad, unilateral extension rights** for estoppel delivery, and no extension obligation for SNDA delivery:

1. **Seller's estoppel extension:** Seller may extend the closing date by up to 60 days (in one or more increments) to provide additional time for estoppel fulfillment (detailed seller-side PSA, Section 6.1(b)). This is the most protective seller position in the precedents.
2. **No buyer extension right:** Buyer should not have an independent extension right for estoppels. If buyer wants to extend for its own reasons (e.g., financing), that should be governed by general extension provisions.
3. **Extension at no cost to seller:** Seller's estoppel extension should not require seller to post additional security or pay extension fees.
4. **No SNDA extension:** No extension rights should be tied to SNDA delivery. SNDAs are buyer's responsibility in a no-financing-contingency deal.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Length of extension:** The detailed seller-side PSA's 60-day total extension is at the outer limit. Buyer will push for shorter seller extension rights (14-21 days). The UNICO Buyer Side form provides 14 days for seller cure plus a separate 14-day buyer postponement, for 28 days total.
- **Multiple increments:** Seller should be able to take the extension in multiple shorter increments (e.g., two 30-day extensions or four 15-day extensions) rather than a single block. This gives seller flexibility to continue pursuing without committing to the full extension upfront.
- **Interaction with buyer's termination right:** If the extension expires and estoppels are still not obtained, buyer should have the right to terminate (with deposit return). The extension postpones buyer's termination right -- it does not eliminate it.
- **Extension fees:** Buyer will push for daily or periodic extension fees to compensate for delay. Resist these or cap them at a nominal amount.
- **Buyer's right during extension:** During seller's estoppel extension, buyer should remain obligated to close if the estoppel condition is satisfied. Buyer cannot use the extension period to seek another deal.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Starting position and concession chain:**
1. **Best position:** 60-day unilateral seller extension, no cost, multiple increments
2. **First concession:** 30-day seller extension, no cost
3. **Second concession:** 14-day seller extension plus 14-day buyer extension (mutual, per UNICO Buyer Side)
4. **Third concession:** 14-day seller extension only, with nominal per-diem fee
5. **Maximum concession:** No seller extension; estoppel condition must be met by original closing date or buyer terminates

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk to seller:** 30-60 day extension. Ample time to pursue tenants.
- **Medium risk to seller:** 14-day extension. Tight but often sufficient.
- **High risk to seller:** No extension. Seller must obtain all estoppels before the original closing date or face buyer termination.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** Longer extensions needed (30-60 days) due to national retailer processing times.
- **Office:** 14-30 day extensions are typically sufficient.
- **Industrial:** 14 days may be sufficient for properties with few tenants.
- **Data Center:** 30 days for hyperscale tenant processing times.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Colorado:** The detailed seller-side PSA's 60-day extension is consistent with Colorado practice for institutional deals.
- **New York:** NY buyers may resist extensions longer than 30 days. NY practice emphasizes closing certainty.

## 12. Seller's Obligations to Request and Pursue Estoppels -- Seller's Perspective

### Preferred Position

Seller should commit only to a **"commercially reasonable efforts" standard** with clearly defined procedural obligations. The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 7.1) is the model:

1. "Seller shall make commercially reasonable efforts to obtain executed estoppel certificates"
2. Seller delivers drafts within 3 business days
3. Buyer review period of 3 business days (with deemed approval)
4. Seller delivers to tenants and asks each to execute within lease-required time period (or 10 days if not specified)
5. Seller forwards executed estoppels to buyer within 2 business days
6. "Provided Seller has complied with the requirements above, Seller shall not be in default if any Tenant does not execute and deliver an estoppel certificate"

The key sentence is the last one: **seller is not in default for tenant non-cooperation** so long as seller follows the process.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Effort standard:** "Commercially reasonable efforts" (market standard for seller) is lower than "good faith, diligent efforts" (buyer's preferred standard). The difference matters: "commercially reasonable efforts" generally means what a similarly situated prudent seller would do, while "good faith, diligent efforts" implies active and persistent pursuit. Resist any standard higher than "commercially reasonable efforts."
- **No litigation obligation:** Seller should not be required to sue tenants, declare lease defaults, or incur legal fees to compel estoppel execution. The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 9.3) acknowledges this: "without any need to file claims or incur substantial costs."
- **No obligation to offer incentives:** Seller should not be required to offer tenants rent credits, lease modifications, or other incentives to induce estoppel execution.
- **Reporting:** Resist mandatory weekly reporting obligations. Seller should agree to keep buyer "reasonably informed" of estoppel status upon request, but not to provide formal written reports on a scheduled basis.
- **Direct tenant contact by buyer:** Seller should retain control over tenant communications. Buyer should not be permitted to contact tenants directly about estoppels without seller's prior consent. This protects the landlord-tenant relationship and prevents buyer from making representations to tenants that could create issues.
- **Property manager involvement:** Seller may delegate estoppel pursuit to its property manager. The PSA should allow this explicitly.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Starting position and concession chain:**
1. **Best position:** Commercially reasonable efforts, no litigation, no incentives, no mandatory reporting, seller controls tenant contact
2. **First concession:** Commercially reasonable efforts including enforcement of lease-required cooperation clauses (short of litigation)
3. **Second concession:** Good faith efforts including lease enforcement, reasonable status updates to buyer upon request
4. **Third concession:** Good faith, diligent efforts including lease enforcement and monthly (not weekly) written status reports
5. **Maximum concession:** Good faith, diligent efforts with lease enforcement, weekly reports, and buyer may contact tenants directly with seller's knowledge

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk to seller:** Commercially reasonable efforts with clear no-default protection. Seller's exposure is limited to following a defined process.
- **Medium risk to seller:** Good faith efforts with lease enforcement. Seller may need to send tenant default notices, which could damage the landlord-tenant relationship.
- **High risk to seller:** Good faith, diligent efforts with reporting and buyer direct contact. Seller loses control of the tenant relationship and faces heightened scrutiny of its efforts.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Retail:** Property managers at retail centers typically have established estoppel request processes. Delegation to the property manager is standard.
- **Office:** Same as retail. Office building property managers handle estoppels routinely.
- **Industrial:** Seller may need to be more personally involved with fewer, larger tenants.
- **Multifamily:** Estoppel pursuit for commercial tenants only; no obligation for residential tenants.
- **Data Center:** Seller's relationship with hyperscale tenants may require more personal involvement.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Oregon:** The UNICO Seller Side form sets the Oregon benchmark for seller's effort standard.
- **Colorado:** The detailed seller-side PSA uses "good faith efforts" for the obligation to pursue -- this is already a concession from the seller's perspective.
- **New York:** NY buyers will push for "good faith, diligent efforts" or "best efforts." Resist "best efforts" -- this is the highest standard and is almost never market for estoppel pursuit.

## 13. Allocation of Estoppel Risk -- Seller's Perspective

### Preferred Position

Seller's risk allocation framework should maximize protections and minimize exposure:

1. **Tenant non-response:** Not seller's default. Seller bears process risk only (must follow the defined procedures). If seller complies, the risk of tenant non-response falls on buyer (buyer may terminate but cannot pursue seller for damages).
2. **Variance risk:** Limited by the "deemed modification" provision. If an estoppel reveals information inconsistent with seller's reps, seller's reps are automatically modified -- no misrepresentation claim. The detailed seller-side PSA (Section 6.1(a)(iv)) establishes this principle.
3. **Stale information risk:** Eliminated by the pre-study-period lock-in. Estoppels obtained early count permanently toward the threshold.
4. **Seller's Estoppel Certificate risk:** Limited by knowledge qualifiers, dollar caps, survival periods, and no-personal-liability protections.
5. **SNDA risk:** Entirely buyer's risk. Seller cooperates but bears no liability for SNDA failure.
6. **Post-closing claims:** Limited by the survival period for seller's reps and warranties (typically 6-12 months) and the aggregate liability cap (typically 1-3% of purchase price).

### Key Negotiation Points

- **"Sole remedy" for termination:** If buyer terminates for estoppel failure, buyer's sole remedy should be return of the deposit. No damages, no specific performance, no expense reimbursement. The detailed seller-side PSA achieves this.
- **Deemed modification as automatic protection:** This provision is seller's most important defense against estoppel-related claims. If a tenant's estoppel reveals adverse information, the information becomes part of the agreed facts -- buyer can terminate (if the condition is not met) but cannot claim seller misrepresented the lease status.
- **Knowledge-qualified Seller's Estoppel Certificates:** Seller's Estoppel Certificates should be qualified by seller's knowledge (not absolute statements). The detailed seller-side PSA Exhibit B-1 uses "to Seller's knowledge" and "to the best of Seller's knowledge."
- **Buyer's knowledge defense:** The detailed seller-side PSA provides that estoppel variances do not disqualify an estoppel if the information was "within Purchaser's Knowledge as of the end of the Study Period." This prevents buyer from claiming surprise over information buyer already had.
- **No post-closing indemnification specific to estoppels:** Estoppel-related claims should be subject to the PSA's general indemnification framework (caps, baskets, survival). Do not agree to a separate, uncapped estoppel indemnification.
- **Dissolution protection:** Seller entity should be able to dissolve after the survival period expires, even if Seller's Estoppel Certificates were delivered. Do not agree to keep the seller entity alive indefinitely for estoppel-related claims.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Starting position and concession chain:**
1. **Best position:** Deemed modification, pre-study-period lock-in, knowledge-qualified Seller's Estoppel Certificates, sole remedy limited to deposit return, general rep cap applies, dissolution permitted after survival
2. **First concession:** Deemed modification, buyer termination right for Material Adverse Effect variances, general rep cap and survival apply to Seller's Estoppel Certificates
3. **Second concession:** No deemed modification but buyer termination right limited to Material Adverse Effect, seller cure period for defaults, general rep cap applies
4. **Third concession:** Buyer termination right for "material" variances (defined by dollar threshold), seller cure period, extended survival for Seller's Estoppel Certificates (e.g., 12 months vs. 6 months for general reps)
5. **Maximum concession:** Buyer termination right for material variances, seller indemnification for Seller's Estoppel Certificate inaccuracies, 12-month survival, separate indemnification basket for estoppel claims -- this is the outer limit of acceptable seller concessions

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk to seller:** Full protection framework (deemed modification, lock-in, knowledge qualifiers, caps). Seller's estoppel exposure is contained and manageable.
- **Medium risk to seller:** Buyer termination right for Material Adverse Effect with seller cure. Seller retains control but faces termination risk for significant variances.
- **High risk to seller:** Buyer termination right for any "material" variance without deemed modification. Each estoppel becomes a potential deal-breaker.
- **Critical risk to seller:** Separate, uncapped estoppel indemnification without knowledge qualifiers. This creates open-ended liability exposure for seller.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Single-tenant:** All estoppel risk is concentrated. Seller should insist on the strongest protections (deemed modification, Seller's Estoppel Certificate with knowledge qualifiers, dollar cap).
- **Multi-tenant (diversified):** Risk is spread. Seller can be slightly more flexible on protections.
- **Retail (anchor-dependent):** Anchor tenant estoppel risk is critical. Insist on Seller's Estoppel Certificate substitution for anchor tenants.
- **Data center:** Hyperscale tenant estoppel risk is high. Insist on strong protections, particularly for power and cooling specification variances.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Colorado:** The detailed seller-side PSA provides the benchmark for seller-protective estoppel risk allocation in institutional deals.
- **Oregon:** The UNICO Seller Side form represents a strong seller position with no closing condition and covenant-only approach.
- **New York:** NY buyers and their counsel are highly sophisticated on estoppel risk allocation. Expect extended negotiation on deemed modification, knowledge qualifiers, and indemnification provisions.
- **Delaware entities:** Confirm that Seller's Estoppel Certificate liability provisions are enforceable under Delaware LLC law, particularly the no-personal-liability protections for members and managers.
