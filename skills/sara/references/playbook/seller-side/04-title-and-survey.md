# Title and Survey -- Seller Side Playbook

This playbook addresses the negotiation of title and survey provisions from the seller's perspective in institutional commercial real estate dispositions ($50M+). All recommendations assume financed buyers without a financing contingency in the PSA, multi-jurisdictional applicability, and seller's goal of closing certainty with minimal post-signing obligations.

## 1. Title Commitment Delivery Timing and Obligations

### Preferred Position
Seller's preferred position is to minimize its obligation to deliver title materials while preserving closing certainty. The optimal formulation is that Seller will **"request"** (not "cause" or "deliver") the title company to make the title commitment available to Buyer. This language (used in both the UNICO Seller Side, Section 4.1, and UNICO Buyer Side, Section 4.1) places the delivery obligation on the title company, not on Seller, and insulates Seller from liability for late delivery.

Key drafting elements from Seller's perspective:
- Use "Seller shall **request** Title Company to make available" rather than "Seller shall deliver" or "Seller shall cause to be delivered."
- Specify a Title Commitment Delivery Date that is reasonable (10-15 business days after Effective Date) but do not agree to day-for-day extensions of the due diligence period for late delivery. If a day-for-day extension must be conceded, limit it to the period of actual delay, capped at a reasonable maximum (e.g., 10 additional business days).
- If the title commitment was made available in the data room prior to signing (as in the Meadows transaction, Section 1.2, referencing Commitment No. 322100176), reference the specific commitment and argue that Seller has already satisfied its delivery obligation.
- Electronic delivery is acceptable and now standard.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **"Request" vs. "cause" vs. "deliver"**: "Request" is the weakest obligation and preferred by Seller. "Cause" implies a result-oriented duty. "Deliver" places the obligation squarely on Seller. Maintain the "request" formulation.
2. **Day-for-day extensions**: Resist any extension of the due diligence period for late title commitment delivery. If Buyer insists, cap the extension and make clear that the extension applies only to the due diligence deadline (not the Closing Date).
3. **Pre-Effective Date delivery**: If the commitment was in the data room, argue that Buyer had access prior to signing and that no additional delivery obligation exists. The Meadows form supports this position.
4. **Title Documents (underlying exceptions)**: Seller should deliver only those exception documents that are in Seller's possession or that are provided by the title company. Seller should not be required to independently search for or obtain copies of recorded instruments.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "Seller must 'cause' delivery of the commitment." **Fallback**: Accept "cause" language but add a qualifier: "Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Title Company to deliver..." This preserves flexibility if the title company is slow.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Day-for-day extension if commitment is late." **Fallback**: Accept the extension but cap it (e.g., "not to exceed 10 additional business days"). Also, include a provision that the extension does not extend the Closing Date.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Seller must deliver legible copies of all exception documents." **Fallback**: Agree to deliver copies "in Seller's possession or as provided by the Title Company." Do not accept an obligation to independently obtain documents from county recording offices.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** for Seller: The title commitment delivery obligation is a ministerial task. The primary risk is that late delivery triggers a due diligence extension, which delays the deposit going hard.
- **Mitigation**: Order the preliminary title report well before PSA execution. In marketed deals, include the commitment in the data room and reference it in the PSA.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **All asset types**: Preparation of the title commitment should begin during the marketing process. For complex assets (retail with REAs, industrial with environmental restrictions, data centers with utility easements), allow additional lead time for the title company to identify all relevant exceptions.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: Title searches in New York are often conducted by the buyer's attorney or abstract company. Seller should not assume the obligation of ordering the commitment; require Buyer to order its own commitment at Buyer's expense.
- **California**: Preliminary reports are issued rather than commitments. Adjust language accordingly.
- **Western states (OR, WA, CO)**: Title companies routinely prepare preliminary commitments as part of the escrow process. Seller's obligation is limited to requesting the title company to proceed.

## 2. Title Objection Period and Mechanics

### Preferred Position
Seller's preferred position is to **compress the objection timeline**, **limit the scope of objectable items**, and ensure that unobjected matters become **irrevocable Permitted Exceptions** through deemed approval.

Key structural preferences:
- **Fixed objection date**: The Title Objection Date should be a **fixed calendar date** or a date tied to the Effective Date (not to receipt of the commitment). The UNICO Seller Side form defines the Title Objection Date as "__ Business Days after the later of (a) Purchaser's receipt of the Title Commitment and Title Documents, or (b) the Effective Date." Seller should try to replace "the later of" with "the earlier of" or simply tie the date to the Effective Date alone.
- **Single consolidated notice**: Require Buyer to deliver a **single** consolidated Title Objection Notice identifying all objections (see ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(b)). No piecemeal objections.
- **Deemed approval of unobjected items**: Any Exception not timely objected to becomes a Permitted Exception automatically. This is universal across all forms reviewed and should always be included.
- **Pre-defined Permitted Exceptions**: Define Permitted Exceptions broadly to include categories of items that Buyer cannot object to (see Section 6 below). The ASB/UNICO Detailed form's approach of defining 8 categories (subsections (a)-(h)) that are automatically Permitted Exceptions, regardless of Buyer's objection, is the gold standard from Seller's perspective.
- **Prohibition on objecting to certain items**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form (Section 4.1(b)) provides that "Purchaser shall have no right to object to any of the matters set forth within subsections (a) through (h) of the definition of Permitted Exceptions." This is powerful Seller protection.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Objection deadline trigger**: Avoid tying the deadline to Buyer's receipt of the commitment (which Buyer can claim was late or incomplete). Prefer a date measured from the Effective Date.
2. **Length of objection period**: 10 business days from the Effective Date is Seller-favorable. The PSA Seller (income property) form uses 10 days. Buyer will push for 15-20 business days measured from receipt of the commitment; resist this but recognize that 10-15 business days from receipt is market for institutional deals.
3. **Scope limitations**: Pre-define as many items as possible as Permitted Exceptions that Buyer cannot object to (see Section 6). The more items carved out from the objection process, the less leverage Buyer has.
4. **Survey objections bundled or separate**: From Seller's perspective, bundling survey and title objections into a single deadline is preferable (Meadows, Section 1.2). This prevents Buyer from raising survey objections after the title objection period has passed.
5. **Interaction with due diligence**: From Seller's perspective, title objections should be part of the general due diligence contingency, not an independent right. If Buyer waives its due diligence contingency (by failing to terminate during the diligence period), all title objections that Seller did not elect to cure should become Permitted Exceptions. The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 4.3) accomplishes this: "If Seller does not elect to cure all of the Title Objections and Buyer elects to waive its Due Diligence contingency under Section 3.2, those Title Objections that Seller did not elect to cure shall be deemed to have been approved by Buyer."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "Objection period should run from receipt of the commitment, not the Effective Date." **Fallback**: Accept "later of" formulation (UNICO forms) but push for a short period (10 BD) and ensure day-for-day extension, if conceded, is capped.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Buyer should have the right to raise objections to individual exceptions as they are reviewed, not just in a single notice." **Response**: Reject. Multiple notices create administrative complexity and ambiguity about which exceptions have been objected to. Insist on a single consolidated notice.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Title objection rights should survive expiration of the due diligence period." **Response**: This is a significant Buyer ask. Resist strongly -- title objections should be resolved during the diligence period. Fallback: Allow a limited post-diligence objection right only for **new** matters appearing after the diligence period (gap/supplemental objections), not for matters that were disclosed in the initial commitment.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk** for Seller: If title objection rights survive the due diligence period, Buyer retains a de facto termination right throughout the contract period. Any new exception -- even a minor one -- could give Buyer an exit.
- **Medium risk**: Buyer using title objections as pretext for termination when the real issue is market conditions or financing difficulties.
- **Mitigation**: Keep title objections within the due diligence framework. Require a single consolidated notice. Pre-define Permitted Exceptions broadly.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Retail**: Seller should pre-define all REA and OEA matters as Permitted Exceptions. These are deal-defining documents that Buyer reviewed during due diligence; they should not be subject to post-diligence title objections.
- **Industrial**: Environmental use restrictions and deed restrictions should be pre-defined as Permitted Exceptions if they were disclosed in marketing materials.
- **Data centers**: Utility and fiber easements are essential to operations and should be Permitted Exceptions.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: NY practice allows the purchaser to object at any time before closing to new title matters. This is extremely buyer-favorable. In NY deals, push hard to limit post-diligence objection rights to truly new matters not disclosed in the original commitment.
- **Oregon/Washington**: The Meadows and PSA Seller (income property) forms both use fixed objection dates, which is the preferred Seller approach.

## 3. Seller's Cure Rights: Mandatory Cure Items vs. Elective Cure

### Preferred Position
Seller's core objective is to **minimize mandatory cure obligations** and **maximize elective cure discretion**. The ideal structure:

**Mandatory cure (cannot be avoided):**
- Mortgages and deeds of trust voluntarily placed by Seller on the Property (which will be paid from proceeds at Closing)
- UCC financing statements filed by Seller's lenders against the Property

**Elective cure (Seller chooses whether to cure):**
- Everything else, including mechanic's liens, judgments against Seller, non-monetary title defects, survey matters, and any other exceptions Buyer objects to.

**Dollar cap on elective cure expenditures:** The ASB/UNICO Detailed form caps Seller's cure expenditure at **$10,000 in the aggregate** (excluding Voluntary Liens). This is the strongest Seller position available in the precedent forms. The cap ensures that Seller is not required to spend significant sums to cure title defects for which Seller has no obligation.

**No obligation to bring suit:** Seller should never be required to initiate litigation to clear title (ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(b): "Seller shall in no event be required to bring suit to clear any claimed title or survey defects").

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **"Voluntary Lien" definition**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form defines "Voluntary Lien" to include: (a) mortgages/deeds of trust granted or assumed by Seller; (b) mechanic's/materialmen's liens arising from Seller-contracted work; and (c) other liens voluntarily granted by Seller securing repayment of money. Seller should try to **narrow** this definition. Specifically:
   - Resist including mechanic's liens in the mandatory cure category. Argue that mechanic's liens may be disputed and should be subject to Seller's election to cure.
   - Limit mandatory cure to mortgages and deeds of trust that Seller affirmatively placed on the Property (not assumed or inherited).
   - Exclude any Permitted Exception from the Voluntary Lien definition (this is already in the ASB/UNICO Detailed form).
2. **Cure cap**: Start at $10,000 (ASB/UNICO Detailed) and concede upward only if necessary. $25,000-$50,000 is a reasonable fallback for institutional deals. Never agree to an unlimited cure obligation for non-monetary items.
3. **"Remove" definition**: Define "Remove" broadly to include title company insurance-over (not just actual removal of the exception from the record). The ASB/UNICO Detailed form provides: "'Remove' or 'Removed'...shall mean that Seller causes the Title Company to remove or affirmatively insure over the same as an exception to the Purchaser's Owner's Title Policy, without any additional cost or liability to Purchaser." This gives Seller flexibility -- an endorsement or insurance-over is often cheaper and faster than actual removal.
4. **"Reasonable efforts" standard**: If Seller elects to cure, the standard should be **"reasonable efforts"** (not "best efforts" or "all commercially reasonable efforts"). The ASB/UNICO Detailed form uses "reasonable efforts to Remove." This is an important distinction.
5. **Use of proceeds to cure**: Seller should include language permitting the use of Purchase Price proceeds to satisfy liens at Closing (ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(d): "Seller may, at the time of Closing, use the Purchase Price or any portion thereof to clear the title of any or all encumbrances or interests").

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "Mandatory cure should include all monetary liens, not just Seller's mortgages." **Fallback**: Accept mandatory cure for liens voluntarily created by Seller (Voluntary Liens per the ASB/UNICO Detailed definition) but maintain a cure cap for everything else.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Mechanic's liens should be mandatory cure." **Fallback**: Accept mandatory cure for mechanic's liens arising from Seller-contracted work (this is in the Voluntary Lien definition). Resist mandatory cure for mechanic's liens arising from tenant-contracted work.
- **Buyer pushback**: "$10,000 cap is unreasonable." **Fallback**: Move to $25,000, then $50,000, then $100,000. Do not concede an unlimited obligation for non-Voluntary Lien items.
- **Buyer pushback**: "No cure cap for judgments against Seller." **Fallback**: Judgments against Seller are problematic because they are Seller's personal obligations and should not become Buyer's burden. Consider conceding mandatory cure for judgments against Seller specifically, but not against prior owners or unrelated parties.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Seller must cure exceptions relating to Seller's authority/good standing." **Response**: This is reasonable and should be conceded (UNICO forms, Section 4.3(y)). Seller should always be able to demonstrate its authority to convey.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk** for Seller: The cure cap is a frequent point of negotiation. If set too low, Buyer will push back aggressively. If set too high, Seller may face unexpected cure costs.
- **Low risk**: Mandatory cure of Seller's own mortgages is not a real risk -- Seller will pay these off from proceeds in any event.
- **Mitigation**: Prior to marketing, clear any title defects that could become negotiation issues. Pay off old judgments, release expired UCC filings, and record any missing satisfactions.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Development/value-add**: Higher risk of mechanic's liens from ongoing construction. If Seller is actively constructing, consider escrowing a portion of proceeds to cover potential mechanic's lien claims that may arise after Closing.
- **Operating assets**: Lower mechanic's lien risk. Standard cure provisions are typically sufficient.
- **Industrial**: Environmental use restrictions may be contested by Buyer but should be pre-defined as Permitted Exceptions, not subject to cure.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: NY practice is that Seller must cure monetary liens "that are due and payable, but which remain unpaid or of record" with **no cap** on the amount (NY Checklist). This is a strong buyer position. In NY deals, Seller should push back to limit mandatory cure to Seller's own liens, not inherited or judgment liens.
- **Oregon**: Oregon construction lien law allows liens to relate back to the date of commencement of improvement. Seller should verify no outstanding construction lien exposure before marketing.
- **Colorado**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form (Colorado property) uses the $10,000 cap, which is market for Colorado institutional deals.
- **Washington**: No unusual cure requirements. The PSA Seller (income property) form does not specify a cap, leaving cure as fully elective.

## 4. Buyer's Remedies if Seller Declines to Cure

### Preferred Position
If Seller elects not to cure a Title Objection, Buyer's remedies should be **strictly limited** to:

**Option A -- Terminate and receive return of earnest money.** Buyer may terminate the Agreement and receive a return of the earnest money deposit. No additional damages, no reimbursement of costs, and no specific performance.

**Option B -- Waive and proceed.** Buyer accepts title subject to the uncured exception, which becomes a Permitted Exception. No purchase price reduction.

This binary is market standard. All forms reviewed provide for this framework:
- UNICO Seller Side, Section 4.3: Buyer may (a) terminate with return of deposit or (b) proceed with uncured exceptions as Permitted Exceptions.
- ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(b)-(c): Same framework with additional nuance for intervening title objections.
- Meadows, Section 1.2: Same framework.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **No purchase price reduction**: Buyer has no right to reduce the Purchase Price as a remedy for uncured title defects. This is not a "damages" scenario -- Buyer's recourse is to terminate or waive.
2. **No cost reimbursement**: Buyer should not be entitled to reimbursement of due diligence costs or transaction expenses if Buyer terminates due to uncured title objections. The deposit return is Buyer's sole remedy. The Meadows form deducts "Independent Consideration" from the returned deposit, which Seller retains.
3. **No specific performance**: Buyer should not be able to compel Seller to cure a title defect. If Seller elects not to cure, that election is final. Specific performance should be available only for Seller's failure to close after all conditions are satisfied.
4. **Deemed waiver**: If Buyer fails to exercise its termination right within the specified period (typically 5 BD), Buyer is deemed to have waived the objection and accepted the exception as a Permitted Exception. This deemed waiver provision is essential.
5. **Timing of Buyer's election**: Buyer's election between termination and waiver should be on a **short** timeline (3-5 BD) after Seller's election not to cure. The UNICO Seller Side form provides 5 BD; the Meadows form provides 3 BD. Shorter is better from Seller's perspective.
6. **Title objections within due diligence**: If title objections are part of the general due diligence framework (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 4.3), Seller benefits from the structure where Buyer's waiver of diligence automatically converts uncured Title Objections to Permitted Exceptions. This is the preferred structure.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "Buyer should be entitled to reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs if Seller refuses to cure." **Response**: Reject. Seller's election not to cure is a contractual right, not a default. Cost reimbursement is available only in Seller default scenarios.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Buyer should have the right to a purchase price reduction equal to the cost of curing the defect." **Response**: Reject. This would give Buyer a unilateral right to reduce the price and would create disputes about cure cost estimates.
- **Buyer pushback**: "10 business days for Buyer's election, not 5." **Fallback**: Concede 5-7 BD at most. Longer periods create uncertainty for Seller.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** for Seller: The binary remedy framework (terminate or waive) is well-established and market standard. Seller's primary risk is that Buyer uses title objections as a pretext for termination when the real reason is unrelated (market decline, financing issues).
- **Mitigation**: Tie title objections to the due diligence period so that Buyer's title-related termination right expires with the due diligence period (except for gap/supplemental matters).

### Asset-Type Variations
- No significant variation. The remedial framework is consistent across all asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: NY practice follows the same binary framework. The NY Checklist states Buyer "may choose to either: terminate the contract, and have the deposit returned; or close the transaction, with such title as the seller can transfer."
- **All jurisdictions**: This framework is universal in institutional commercial transactions.

## 5. Gap/Supplemental Title Updates and Objections

### Preferred Position
Seller's preferred position is to **limit Buyer's post-diligence title objection rights** to the greatest extent possible. The ideal construct:

1. **"Material Adverse Effect" qualifier**: Buyer may only object to new/supplemental title exceptions that "can reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on title to the Real Property from and after the Closing" (ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(c)). This threshold prevents Buyer from terminating over minor, inconsequential matters.

2. **Knowledge cutoff**: Buyer has no right to object to supplemental matters that were within "Purchaser's Knowledge as of the end of the Study Period" (ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(c)). This prevents sandbagging -- Buyer cannot ignore a known issue during diligence and then raise it as a post-diligence objection.

3. **Short notice period**: Buyer must deliver any Intervening Title Objection Notice within **5 business days** after receiving the updated commitment (but in no event later than the Closing Date). Failure to timely notify = deemed approval (ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(c)).

4. **Seller's cure discretion preserved**: Even for gap matters, Seller retains the election to cure or not (with the same cure cap applying). No gap matter should become a mandatory cure item unless it falls within the Voluntary Lien definition.

5. **No automatic Closing Date extension**: Seller's preferred position is that gap objection procedures do **not** automatically extend the Closing Date. The UNICO forms provide for automatic extension; the ASB/UNICO Detailed form provides Seller the right to extend at Seller's election (Section 4.1(e)). The latter is preferred -- Seller controls whether an extension occurs.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **"Material Adverse Effect" threshold**: This is the most important protection for Seller. Without it, any new exception (even a minor utility easement amendment) could give Buyer a termination right. Define "Material Adverse Effect" in the definitions section with a high threshold.
2. **Knowledge cutoff**: Include this provision to prevent Buyer from weaponizing known issues. Define "Purchaser's Knowledge" to include constructive knowledge (information available in the data room or due diligence materials), not just actual knowledge.
3. **Closing Date extension**: If an extension must be conceded, Seller should control the extension right (not Buyer). The ASB/UNICO Detailed form grants Seller (not Buyer) the right to extend the Closing Date for up to 60 days (Section 6.1(b)) to Remove title exceptions. This preserves Seller's control over timing.
4. **No delay from buyer-requested endorsements**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form (Section 4.1(f)) provides that "the Closing shall not be delayed as a result of Purchaser's request" for endorsements. This is an important protection against Buyer using endorsement negotiations to delay Closing.
5. **Buyer's waiver of gap matters**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form provides that if Buyer fails to include an objection in the Intervening Title Objection Notice, or fails to timely deliver such notice, the matters "shall be Permitted Exceptions and Purchaser shall have no further right to object." This deemed waiver is essential.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "No Material Adverse Effect threshold -- Buyer should be able to object to any new exception." **Fallback**: Accept removal of the MAE threshold but maintain the knowledge cutoff and short notice period. Alternatively, define the threshold lower (e.g., "any new exception that materially and adversely affects the use, occupancy, or value of the Property").
- **Buyer pushback**: "Automatic Closing Date extension for gap objections." **Fallback**: Accept a limited automatic extension (5-10 BD) to allow the objection/response cycle to complete, but cap it. Do not allow open-ended extensions.
- **Buyer pushback**: "No knowledge cutoff -- Buyer should not be penalized for failing to raise issues during diligence." **Response**: The knowledge cutoff prevents abuse. Buyer had the entire diligence period to review and object. Post-diligence objection rights should be limited to truly new matters.

### Risk Assessment
- **High risk** for Seller: Broad post-diligence title objection rights give Buyer a de facto termination right throughout the contract period. Any new exception -- even one created by a third party -- could unwind the deal.
- **Medium risk**: Gap matters that are caused by Seller's actions (e.g., Seller grants a new easement without consent). These should be addressed through the covenants section (see Section 10 below).
- **Mitigation**: Include the MAE threshold, knowledge cutoff, and short notice periods. Ensure Seller's cure discretion is preserved.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **All asset types**: Gap objection protections are equally important regardless of property type. The risk of new exceptions appearing during the contract period is highest for development sites and lowest for stabilized operating assets.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: NY practice broadly permits objection to new title matters at any time before closing. Seller should push back strongly in NY deals to limit post-diligence objection rights.
- **Colorado**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form's gap objection framework is well-developed and represents the market standard for Colorado institutional deals.

## 6. Permitted Exceptions Definition and Negotiation

### Preferred Position
Seller should define "Permitted Exceptions" as broadly as possible to minimize the universe of objectable items. The ASB/UNICO Detailed form defines Permitted Exceptions to include 8 categories (subsections (a)-(h)) that Buyer cannot object to, plus any additional items that become Permitted Exceptions through the objection/approval process.

**Preferred Permitted Exceptions definition (modeled on the ASB/UNICO Detailed form):**
(a) Real property taxes and assessments not yet due and payable;
(b) Rights of tenants under the Leases, as tenants only;
(c) All matters set forth in the Title Commitment that are not timely objected to by Buyer;
(d) All matters shown on the Survey or that would be shown by a correct survey or physical inspection of the Property;
(e) All matters disclosed in the Offering Memorandum or the Due Diligence Materials;
(f) Standard printed exceptions from the title policy;
(g) Applicable zoning, building, and land use regulations;
(h) All matters approved or deemed approved by Buyer pursuant to the title objection process;
(i) Any matters created, permitted, or approved by Buyer.

The Meadows form (Section 1.2) also includes "(iii) matters which would be shown by a correct survey of the Property or a physical inspection of the Property" -- this is powerful Seller protection because it effectively eliminates Buyer's survey objection rights for visible conditions.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **"Shown by survey or physical inspection"**: This is one of the strongest Seller protections. It makes all visible physical conditions (encroachments, encroachment of improvements over boundary lines, location of improvements within easement areas) into Permitted Exceptions regardless of whether Buyer objects. Push hard to include this.
2. **"Disclosed in Offering Memorandum or Due Diligence Materials"**: This is also strong Seller protection. If an issue was disclosed in marketing materials, it should be a Permitted Exception. Buyer will resist this because the OM is not a legal document and may contain errors.
3. **Standard printed exceptions**: These are the exceptions that would be removed by extended coverage. Seller prefers to include these as Permitted Exceptions (shifting the burden and cost of extended coverage to Buyer). If Buyer obtains extended coverage, these are deleted anyway; if Buyer does not obtain extended coverage, Seller is not penalized.
4. **"As tenants only"**: The tenancy Permitted Exception should be limited to "as tenants only" to prevent Buyer from arguing that a tenant's unexercised purchase option or right of first refusal is a Permitted Exception. From Seller's perspective, however, if the purchase option was in a Lease that Buyer reviewed during diligence, it should also be a Permitted Exception through the deemed approval mechanism.
5. **Post-diligence items**: All matters that Buyer failed to object to during the diligence period, and all matters that Buyer objected to but did not terminate over, should become irrevocable Permitted Exceptions.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "Remove 'matters shown by survey or physical inspection' from Permitted Exceptions." **Fallback**: Narrow it to "matters shown on the Existing Survey delivered to Buyer." This preserves some Seller protection while giving Buyer the right to object to matters revealed only by the Updated Survey.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Remove 'disclosed in Offering Memorandum' from Permitted Exceptions." **Fallback**: Replace with "matters described in the Due Diligence Materials delivered to Buyer." This is slightly narrower but still provides significant Seller protection.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Standard printed exceptions should not be Permitted Exceptions because Buyer will obtain extended coverage." **Fallback**: Accept deletion if Buyer is obtaining extended coverage. Include a provision that if Buyer fails to obtain extended coverage (e.g., due to failure to obtain a survey), the standard printed exceptions remain as Permitted Exceptions.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Permitted Exceptions should be built through the process, not pre-defined." **Response**: A hybrid approach works: pre-define certain baseline categories (taxes, tenancy, zoning) while building the rest through the objection process.

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical risk** for Seller: A narrowly defined Permitted Exceptions definition gives Buyer broad objection rights and multiple termination hooks.
- **Medium risk**: Buyer objects to a pre-defined Permitted Exception (e.g., an REA) that was clearly disclosed during diligence. If the PSA does not prohibit this objection, Seller must respond.
- **Mitigation**: Pre-define as many categories as possible. Include the prohibition on objecting to subsections (a)-(h) (ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(b)).

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Retail**: Pre-define all REAs, OEAs, and CC&Rs as Permitted Exceptions. These are deal-defining documents and should not be subject to post-signing objections.
- **Industrial**: Pre-define environmental use restrictions, deed restrictions, and rail easements.
- **Office**: Pre-define parking easements, shared-infrastructure agreements, and building access easements.
- **Data centers**: Pre-define utility easements, fiber easements, and power line easements.
- **Multifamily**: Pre-define regulatory agreements (LIHTC, HUD), condominium declarations, and affordable housing covenants.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: The NY Checklist includes "recorded covenants, restrictions, and easements" as Permitted Exceptions by default. This aligns with Seller's preferred position.
- **All jurisdictions**: The Permitted Exceptions definition is contract-driven and has no mandatory statutory components (other than taxes and zoning, which are inherent in all real property).

## 7. Survey Requirements

### Preferred Position
Seller's preferred position is that the survey is **Buyer's responsibility** in all respects -- Buyer orders, Buyer pays, and Buyer bears the risk of late delivery. Seller's only obligation should be to deliver existing surveys in Seller's possession and to cooperate reasonably with the surveyor's access.

Key elements:
- Seller delivers existing surveys within 5 BD of the Effective Date (UNICO Seller Side, Section 4.2).
- Buyer may obtain an updated or new survey "at Buyer's sole option, election and expense" (UNICO Buyer/Seller Side, Section 4.2).
- Buyer is responsible for ensuring the survey is delivered to the title company before Closing.
- **Failure to obtain a survey is not a default by Buyer** and does not constitute a failure of any closing condition (UNICO Seller Side, Section 4.2).
- If Buyer fails to arrange for a survey, Buyer must accept a title policy with a survey exception or standard coverage only (UNICO Seller Side, Section 4.2).

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **No Seller obligation to pay for survey**: Universal across all forms. The survey is Buyer's cost.
2. **Access cooperation**: Seller should cooperate with surveyor access, but with limitations: (a) access during normal business hours, (b) no disruption to tenants, (c) surveyor must comply with Seller's access protocols.
3. **Survey certification**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form requires the survey to be addressed to both Purchaser and Seller, and requires Buyer to deliver two originals to Seller. This is reasonable and gives Seller a certified survey for its records.
4. **Survey-as-condition**: Seller should resist any PSA structure where Buyer's failure to obtain a satisfactory survey is a condition to Closing. The UNICO Seller Side form correctly provides that "Failure to make arrangements for an Updated Survey shall not be a default by Purchaser...nor [a] failure of any condition relating to issuance of the Title Policy with extended coverage."
5. **No closing extension for survey delays**: If the survey is delayed, the Closing Date should not be extended.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "Seller should pay for the existing survey update." **Response**: Reject. The survey is for Buyer's benefit.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Seller should be required to provide survey access within 24 hours of request." **Fallback**: Agree to "reasonable" access within 2 BD of request, subject to tenant cooperation and Seller's right to have a representative present.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Survey certification should include Buyer's lender." **Response**: This is Buyer's issue to coordinate with the surveyor. Seller should not be involved in the survey certification.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** for Seller: Survey obligations are minimal. The only risk is if Buyer's survey reveals issues that become title objections (see Section 8).
- **Mitigation**: If Seller has a recent survey, provide it early to avoid surprise findings. Consider having Seller's own surveyor update the survey pre-marketing to identify and address issues.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No significant variation from Seller's perspective. Survey responsibilities are Buyer's in all cases.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant variation. Survey requirements are national (ALTA/NSPS standards).

## 8. Survey Objection Mechanics

### Preferred Position
From Seller's perspective, survey objections should be handled **within the same framework and timeline** as title objections. This prevents Buyer from having a separate, potentially longer, survey objection window.

Preferred provisions:
- Survey objections must be raised by the **same Title Objection Date** as title objections.
- If the survey is not available by the Title Objection Date, Buyer has **no** separate survey objection period -- Buyer assumed the risk of late survey delivery.
- Alternatively, the Meadows form approach: "matters which would be shown by a correct survey of the Property or a physical inspection of the Property" are Permitted Exceptions by definition, effectively eliminating survey objection rights entirely.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Same deadline**: Bundle survey and title objections to a single deadline. The Meadows form (Section 1.2) achieves this.
2. **"Shown by survey" Permitted Exception**: If Seller can include this in the Permitted Exceptions definition, survey objections are effectively moot for visible/physical conditions.
3. **No separate survey update objection**: If Buyer obtains an Updated Survey that reveals new matters, those matters should be treated the same as any other gap/supplemental title issue -- subject to the MAE threshold, knowledge cutoff, and short notice periods.
4. **Scope of survey objections**: Seller should argue that survey matters (encroachments, setback issues) are **physical due diligence matters** that should be resolved during the general due diligence period, not through the title objection process. This classification ties survey resolution to the diligence contingency (which expires), rather than to an independent title objection right (which may survive).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "Survey objection period should run from receipt of the survey, not from the Title Objection Date." **Fallback**: Accept a separate survey objection deadline tied to receipt of the survey, but make it short (5 BD) and ensure that the same cure/response mechanics apply (Seller election, deemed waiver).
- **Buyer pushback**: "Remove 'shown by survey' from Permitted Exceptions." **Fallback**: Narrow to "shown on the Existing Survey" only, preserving Buyer's right to object to matters newly revealed by the Updated Survey.

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium risk** for Seller: Survey-revealed issues (particularly encroachments onto adjacent property or into easement areas) can be difficult and expensive to cure. Seller's election to cure should always be discretionary.
- **Mitigation**: Obtain an updated survey pre-marketing to identify issues. Address encroachments through title company insurance-over or negotiations with adjacent owners before marketing.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Industrial**: Truck courts and loading docks near property boundaries create encroachment risk. Pre-marketing survey update is advisable.
- **Office**: Underground parking structures near boundaries create potential encroachment issues.
- **Retail**: Outparcels and pad sites frequently have shared-access and parking easement issues visible on survey.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant jurisdictional variation. Survey objection mechanics are contract-driven.

## 9. Title Insurance Requirements

### Preferred Position
Seller should agree to deliver title at Closing subject to Permitted Exceptions and insurable by a nationally recognized title company. The specific title insurance provisions should allocate costs and risks to Buyer to the greatest extent possible.

Key positions:
- **Standard vs. extended coverage**: Seller pays the standard coverage premium only. Buyer pays the incremental cost of extended coverage and all endorsements (UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.6.2; PSA Seller income property, Section 11.3). Extended coverage is Buyer's election and Buyer's cost.
- **Owner's title affidavit**: Seller should execute a standard owner's title affidavit to enable the title company to delete the standard exceptions (required for extended coverage). This is market standard and should be conceded (UNICO Seller Side, Section 4.5). However, limit the affidavit to "customary" or "standard" forms -- do not agree to a "reasonably required" standard, which could expand the affidavit scope.
- **Endorsements are Buyer's responsibility**: Buyer's ability or inability to obtain endorsements should not be a condition to Closing and should not entitle Buyer to a purchase price reduction (ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(f)). This is critical Seller protection.
- **Closing condition**: The title company's willingness to issue the owner's policy should be a condition to Buyer's closing obligation (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 10.1.2), but this condition should be limited to issuing the policy subject to Permitted Exceptions. If the title company raises a new exception that is a Permitted Exception, Buyer should not be able to refuse to close.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Premium allocation**: Standard market is Seller pays the standard premium; Buyer pays extended coverage and endorsements. The UNICO Seller Side form follows this. Resist attempts by Buyer to shift the full premium (including extended coverage) to Seller.
2. **Endorsement conditions**: The ASB/UNICO Detailed form's provision that Buyer's obligation to close is not conditioned on endorsement availability is one of the most important Seller protections. Push for this language: "Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement shall not be conditioned upon its ability to obtain such endorsements and, if Purchaser is unable to obtain such endorsements, Purchaser shall nevertheless be obligated to proceed to close...without reduction of or set off against the Purchase Price" (Section 4.1(f)).
3. **No Closing delay for endorsements**: "The Closing shall not be delayed as a result of Purchaser's request" for endorsements (ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(f)).
4. **Owner's title affidavit scope**: Limit to "customary" forms. Do not agree to an open-ended affidavit requirement. The UNICO Seller Side form uses "customarily or reasonably requires" -- try to drop "reasonably."
5. **Title company's discretionary exceptions**: If the title company adds exceptions at its discretion (e.g., a "creditor's rights" exception or an "arbitration" exception), these should not give Buyer a termination right unless they constitute a breach of Seller's covenants.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "Seller should pay the entire title insurance premium." **Fallback**: In jurisdictions where the seller customarily pays (e.g., most Florida counties), concede. In all other jurisdictions, maintain the standard/extended split.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Title policy issuance with all requested endorsements should be a condition to closing." **Fallback**: Accept that policy issuance is a condition, but not endorsement availability. The condition should be: "The Title Company shall be irrevocably committed and ready, willing and able to issue the Title Policy [subject only to the Permitted Exceptions]."
- **Buyer pushback**: "Seller should pay for the lender's policy." **Response**: Reject. The lender's policy is a financing cost and is Buyer's responsibility.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** for Seller: Title insurance provisions are well-established and rarely create closing uncertainty for Seller. The primary risk is that the title company identifies a previously unknown issue that prevents policy issuance.
- **Mitigation**: Order a preliminary title report pre-marketing and address any issues before listing the property.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No significant variation from Seller's perspective. Premium allocation and endorsement provisions are consistent across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **Texas**: Title insurance rates are promulgated. No negotiation on premiums; focus on endorsement allocation.
- **Florida**: Seller customarily pays the owner's policy premium in most counties (Dade, Broward exceptions). Be aware of local custom.
- **New York**: Title insurance is available from major underwriters. Seller should pre-approve the title company and review the commitment form.
- **California**: CLTA forms are used alongside ALTA forms. Ensure PSA language covers both.

## 10. Voluntary Exceptions Created by Seller After the Effective Date

### Preferred Position
Seller should covenant not to create new title exceptions after the Effective Date without Buyer's consent, but this covenant should be **narrowly drafted** to preserve Seller's operational flexibility during the contract period.

Preferred formulation (from the Meadows form, Section 6.1):
- Seller will not voluntarily create new liens or encumbrances on the Property.
- Seller may continue ordinary-course operations, including entering into contracts that are terminable on 30 days' notice without penalty.
- Seller may enter into emergency contracts without Buyer's consent if necessary to protect the Property.
- Seller may continue leasing activities, subject to Buyer's consent (not unreasonably withheld) for new leases and material amendments after expiration of the Property Approval Period.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Emergency exception**: Seller needs the ability to respond to emergencies (roof collapse, pipe burst, fire damage) by entering into repair contracts without Buyer's prior consent. The Meadows form permits this if the contract is "necessary as a result of an emergency" and "terminable upon not more than thirty (30) calendar days' notice without penalty."
2. **Leasing activities**: Seller must continue leasing to maintain the property's income stream. Require Buyer's consent for new leases and material amendments, but include a deemed-approval mechanism (e.g., if Buyer does not object within 5 BD of receiving the proposed lease, consent is deemed granted -- see PSA Seller income property, Section 8(a)).
3. **Routine operations**: Seller should be able to renew existing contracts, maintain insurance, and perform routine maintenance without Buyer's consent.
4. **Consequence of violation**: If Seller breaches this covenant, the appropriate remedy is that the new exception becomes a mandatory cure item (Seller must remove it at Closing). Resist Buyer's argument that a breach gives Buyer a general termination right with cost reimbursement.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "Seller's breach of this covenant should be a default entitling Buyer to terminate with cost reimbursement." **Fallback**: Accept that a willful breach is a default, but provide Seller with a cure period (e.g., 10 BD) to remove the offending exception before Buyer may terminate.
- **Buyer pushback**: "No emergency exception -- all new contracts require Buyer's consent." **Response**: This is impractical and could expose Seller to liability if an emergency cannot be addressed promptly.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Buyer's consent required for all leasing activity from the Effective Date." **Fallback**: Accept Buyer's consent requirement but with a deemed-approval mechanism and a reasonableness standard.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** for Seller: This is a standard covenant that Seller can easily comply with. The emergency exception and deemed-approval mechanism provide necessary flexibility.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Development sites**: Seller may need to continue development activities (e.g., utility connections, easement grants to municipalities). Include a carve-out for development activities undertaken in accordance with approved plans.
- **Operating assets**: Standard covenant provisions are sufficient.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant variation. This is a contract-driven provision.

---

## 11. Title Company Selection

### Preferred Position
Seller should have meaningful input into title company selection, ideally selecting the title company or at least requiring mutual agreement. In marketed deals, the title company is often designated by Seller during the marketing process and included in the PSA.

The ASB/UNICO Detailed form designates "Fidelity National Title Insurance Company" by name, with the title company also serving as the Escrow Agent. This Seller-designated approach is preferred.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Seller designation**: If Seller has an existing relationship with a title company (and particularly if the title company holds Seller's existing title policy), designating that company provides continuity and may result in a reissue rate for Buyer.
2. **Title company as escrow agent**: Seller should prefer that the title company serve as escrow agent to streamline closing. This is standard in Western states.
3. **Buyer's lender requirements**: Buyer may insist on a different title company acceptable to its lender. A reasonable fallback is to allow Buyer's lender to designate a co-insurer or to issue a simultaneous lender's policy through a different underwriter.
4. **Avoid Buyer's counsel as escrow agent**: In New York and certain other jurisdictions, Buyer's counsel sometimes serves as escrow agent. Seller should resist this and insist on an institutional escrow agent (title company or bank).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "Buyer selects the title company." **Fallback**: Agree to mutual selection from among nationally recognized underwriters. If Buyer's lender requires a specific company, accommodate.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Buyer's attorney should hold the deposit." **Response**: Reject in favor of a title company or independent escrow agent. If Seller must concede, require the attorney to maintain the deposit in a separate escrow account and be bound by the PSA's escrow provisions.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Title company selection is rarely a deal issue. All major national underwriters provide comparable coverage.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: Deposit is often held by seller's attorney. Buyer will push for title company or buyer's attorney. Negotiate for a neutral escrow agent.
- **Western states**: Title company as escrow agent is standard.

---

## 12. Simultaneous Issue of Lender's Policy

### Preferred Position
Seller should take the position that the lender's policy is **entirely Buyer's responsibility** -- Buyer pays, Buyer arranges, and the lender's policy is not a condition to Closing.

Key provisions:
- Buyer pays for the lender's policy and all lender-required endorsements.
- The issuance of a lender's policy is **not** a condition to Seller's or Buyer's obligations to close.
- The Closing shall not be delayed to accommodate lender's policy requirements.
- Seller is not required to execute any documents solely for the benefit of Buyer's lender beyond the standard owner's title affidavit.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Not a closing condition**: Emphasize that since there is no financing contingency, all financing-related matters (including the lender's title policy) are Buyer's risk.
2. **No Seller obligation to lender**: Seller should not be required to sign additional affidavits, indemnities, or other documents required by Buyer's lender. Standard owner's title affidavit is the limit.
3. **No closing delay**: If the lender's policy requires additional underwriting time or endorsements, this should not extend the Closing Date.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "Seller should cooperate reasonably with lender's policy requirements." **Fallback**: Accept a general "reasonable cooperation" obligation but exclude any obligation to (a) incur additional cost, (b) assume additional liability, (c) execute non-standard documents, or (d) delay Closing.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Issuance of the lender's policy should be a closing condition." **Response**: Reject. If there is no financing contingency, lender-related conditions should not exist.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** for Seller: Lender's policy issues are Buyer's problem. Seller's only exposure is if the title company identifies a title defect that affects both the owner's and lender's policies.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant variation.

---

## 13. Deed Type

### Preferred Position
Seller should deliver a **special warranty deed** (or jurisdictional equivalent), which warrants title only against claims arising **by, through, or under Seller**. This is the universal institutional standard and limits Seller's ongoing liability to matters within Seller's control.

All forms reviewed use the special warranty deed:
- UNICO Seller Side, Section 11.4.1
- ASB/UNICO Detailed, Exhibit F
- Meadows, Section 4.1
- PSA Seller (income property), Section 4(c)

Key drafting elements for the deed (from the ASB/UNICO Detailed form, Exhibit F):
- "SUBJECT TO the exceptions to title described on Schedule 2 attached hereto" (Permitted Exceptions).
- "The Grantor for itself and its successors in interest does by these presents expressly limit the covenants of this Deed to those herein expressed, and excludes all covenants arising or to arise by statutory or other implication."
- Warranty limited to claims "through or under said Grantor and not otherwise."

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Special warranty, not general warranty**: Never agree to a general warranty deed. A general warranty deed creates liability for all title defects, including those pre-dating Seller's ownership.
2. **"Subject to" Permitted Exceptions**: The deed must be subject to the Permitted Exceptions as defined in the PSA. The schedule of Permitted Exceptions should be attached to the deed.
3. **No anti-merger language in deed**: From Seller's perspective, the doctrine of merger (representations and warranties merge into the deed at closing) is protective. Resist Buyer's request to include a non-merger clause in the deed itself. If a non-merger clause must be included, limit it to representations that expressly survive closing under the PSA, subject to all caps, baskets, and time limitations.
4. **Exclusion of implied covenants**: Include language expressly excluding all covenants "arising or to arise by statutory or other implication" (ASB/UNICO Detailed deed form). This prevents Buyer from arguing that the deed implies warranties beyond the special warranty.
5. **Form attached as exhibit**: The deed form should be attached as an exhibit to the PSA and negotiated at signing, not at Closing. This prevents last-minute disputes.
6. **Title company pre-approval**: Require that the deed form be reviewed and approved by the title company before signing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "Include a non-merger clause in the deed." **Fallback**: Include the non-merger clause but reference the PSA's survival limitations: "subject to all time, dollar and other limitations on Grantor's liability set forth in the Agreement" (ASB/UNICO Detailed deed form). This preserves the survival period, cap on liability, and knowledge/basket qualifiers from the PSA.
- **Buyer pushback**: "General warranty deed." **Response**: Reject. Special warranty is the institutional standard. A general warranty deed is outside market for any commercial transaction of this scale.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Deed should not include release language." **Response**: Agree -- release language belongs in the PSA's "as-is" provisions, not in the deed. However, Seller may include a reference to the PSA's release provisions as a protective measure.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: The special warranty deed is market standard. Seller's liability is limited to claims arising under Seller's ownership.
- **Medium risk**: Failure to exclude implied statutory covenants. In some jurisdictions, the use of certain words of conveyance (e.g., "grant" in California) implies statutory covenants that go beyond the special warranty.
- **Mitigation**: Use state-specific deed forms that expressly limit covenants. Have local counsel review and approve the deed form.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No significant variation. Special warranty deed is standard for all commercial asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- **New York**: Bargain and sale deed with covenants against grantor's acts. Must include a lien law clause. Title company pre-approval is required.
- **California**: Grant deed. Implied statutory covenants attach; consider including language to limit them.
- **Colorado**: Special warranty deed. The ASB/UNICO Detailed form provides a well-drafted Colorado deed form.
- **Oregon**: Special warranty deed.
- **Washington**: Special warranty deed.

---

## 14. Title Objection Response Timelines

### Preferred Position
Seller should maintain **tight response timelines** to move the process forward quickly and bring certainty to the transaction. Seller benefits from short timelines because:
- Buyer has less time to use title objections as a negotiation tactic.
- Uncured objections convert to Permitted Exceptions faster.
- The deposit goes hard sooner.

Preferred timeline from Seller's perspective:

| Step | Action | Deadline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Buyer delivers Title Objection Notice | Title Objection Date (fixed date, 10-15 BD after Effective Date) |
| 2 | Seller delivers cure election notice | 5 BD after receipt of Buyer's notice |
| 3 | Buyer elects to terminate or waive | 3 BD after Seller's election not to cure |
| 4 | For gap matters: Buyer delivers New Objection | 5 BD after receipt of updated commitment |
| 5 | Seller delivers cure election for new matters | 5 BD after receipt of Buyer's new objection |
| 6 | Buyer elects to terminate or waive (new matters) | 3 BD after Seller's election not to cure |

**Key difference from Buyer's preferred timeline**: Step 3 and Step 6 are **3 BD** (not 5 BD). This gives Buyer less time to deliberate and increases the likelihood of deemed waiver.

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Seller's response period (Step 2)**: 5 BD is standard and should be maintained. This gives Seller adequate time to evaluate each objection and determine whether to cure or not.
2. **Buyer's election period (Step 3)**: Seller prefers 3 BD. Buyer will push for 5 BD. Concede to 5 BD if necessary, but not more.
3. **Deemed election not to cure**: If Seller does not respond within the cure election period, the default should be deemed election not to cure (ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(b)). This is actually Seller-neutral -- it simply triggers Buyer's election period.
4. **Closing Date extension for cure**: If Seller elects to cure, Seller should have the right (but not the obligation) to extend the Closing Date for a reasonable period (30-60 days) to effect the cure (ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(e) / 6.1(b)). This extension should be at Seller's election, not automatic.
5. **No Closing Date extension for Buyer's elections**: If Buyer needs more time to decide whether to terminate or waive, that is not grounds for extending the Closing Date.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "5 BD for Buyer's election, not 3." **Fallback**: Concede to 5 BD. This is not a material concession.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Seller's silence should not trigger deemed election." **Response**: Deemed election not to cure upon Seller's silence is market standard. If Seller wants to cure, Seller should affirmatively say so.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Automatic Closing Date extension for all title objection timelines." **Fallback**: Accept automatic extension for gap/supplemental matters only, capped at 10 BD.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Timeline mechanics are procedural and create minimal substantive risk for Seller.
- **Mitigation**: Calendar all title deadlines at signing. Respond promptly to all title objection notices.

### Asset-Type Variations
- No variation. Timeline considerations apply equally across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant jurisdictional variation. Timelines are contract-driven.

---

## 15. Deemed Waiver Provisions

### Preferred Position
Deemed waiver provisions are one of Seller's most important protections in the title context. Seller should insist on robust deemed waiver provisions at every stage of the title review process:

1. **Initial objections**: If Buyer fails to timely deliver a Title Objection Notice, **all** Exceptions in the Title Commitment become Permitted Exceptions (UNICO Seller Side, Section 4.3; ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(b)).
2. **Cure election response**: If Buyer fails to terminate within the election period after Seller declines to cure, the uncured objections become Permitted Exceptions (all forms).
3. **Gap/supplemental matters**: If Buyer fails to timely object to new exceptions in supplemental reports, those exceptions become Permitted Exceptions (UNICO Seller Side, Section 4.4; ASB/UNICO Detailed, Section 4.1(c)).
4. **Due diligence expiration**: If Buyer waives its due diligence contingency (or fails to terminate during the diligence period), all uncured Title Objections become Permitted Exceptions (UNICO Buyer Side, Section 4.3).

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **No carve-outs from deemed waiver**: Buyer will try to carve out mandatory cure items (monetary liens, Seller-created encumbrances) from the deemed waiver mechanism. Concede this for truly mandatory items (Seller's own mortgages) but resist broad carve-outs.
2. **Affirmative termination required**: Structure the PSA so that Buyer must **affirmatively terminate** to exit -- silence or inaction results in the transaction proceeding and objections being waived. This is the "opt-out" model, which is preferred by Seller. The "opt-in" model (where Buyer must affirmatively approve to proceed) is less favorable.
3. **Clear triggering events**: Ensure each deemed waiver provision is triggered by a clearly defined event (delivery of the commitment, expiration of the objection period, delivery of Seller's cure election). Ambiguous triggers create disputes.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "Monetary liens should never be deemed waived." **Fallback**: Concede that Seller's own mortgages and deeds of trust are never deemed waived. But limit this carve-out to Voluntary Liens (as defined in the ASB/UNICO Detailed form).
- **Buyer pushback**: "Buyer should be required to affirmatively approve, not be deemed to approve through silence." **Response**: Reject. The "opt-out" model (silence = waiver) is the market standard for institutional deals and provides Seller with closing certainty.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk** for Seller: Deemed waiver provisions protect Seller from Buyer's delay tactics and inadvertent failure to object.
- **Mitigation**: Ensure all notices and deliveries are properly documented with evidence of receipt (email delivery confirmations, overnight courier tracking).

### Asset-Type Variations
- No variation. Deemed waiver provisions are procedural and apply equally across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant variation. Deemed waiver is a contractual construct applicable in all jurisdictions.

---

## 16. Right to Update Title and Survey Pre-Closing

### Preferred Position
Seller should **not resist** Buyer's right to obtain pre-closing title updates (this is standard practice and the title company will perform a gap search regardless). However, Seller should ensure that pre-closing updates are governed by the gap/supplemental objection framework (with MAE thresholds, knowledge cutoffs, and short notice periods) rather than providing Buyer with open-ended objection rights.

Key provisions:
- Seller will cooperate with reasonable requests for title updates, including executing updated affidavits if required by the title company.
- Pre-closing updates do not extend the Closing Date (unless the gap objection provisions expressly provide for extension).
- Buyer's objection rights to pre-closing updates are limited by the gap/supplemental objection provisions (Section 5 above).
- Seller is not required to pay for pre-closing title updates (these are part of the title company's standard service).

### Key Negotiation Points
1. **Cooperation limited**: Seller's cooperation should be limited to executing "customary" documents (affidavits, certifications). Seller should not be required to provide documents beyond the standard owner's title affidavit.
2. **No new diligence**: Pre-closing updates should not reopen the due diligence period. The update is limited to the title commitment -- Buyer has no right to re-inspect the Property or re-request due diligence materials.
3. **Cost allocation**: Pre-closing title commitment updates are typically at no additional cost (included in the title company's standard service). If additional searches are required (construction lien search, UCC search), Buyer pays.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks
- **Buyer pushback**: "Seller must affirmatively cause the title company to issue pre-closing updates." **Fallback**: Agree, but make clear this is a ministerial obligation and does not create substantive rights beyond the gap objection framework.
- **Buyer pushback**: "Pre-closing updates should automatically extend the Closing Date." **Response**: Reject. Only gap objections (new matters revealed by the update) should potentially extend the Closing Date, and only through the mechanisms described in Section 5.

### Risk Assessment
- **Low risk**: Pre-closing updates are standard practice. Seller's risk is that a new exception appears, but this is managed through the gap objection framework.

### Asset-Type Variations
- **Development/construction**: Higher risk of new mechanic's liens appearing in pre-closing updates. Consider including a Seller representation that no construction work has been performed during the contract period (or, if it has, that all contractors have been paid in full).
- **Operating assets**: Low risk. Standard gap search is typically sufficient.

### Jurisdictional Notes
- No significant variation.
