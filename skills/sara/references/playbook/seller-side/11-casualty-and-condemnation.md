# Casualty and Condemnation (Risk of Loss) — Seller Playbook

This playbook addresses the Casualty and Condemnation (Risk of Loss) provisions of a commercial real estate purchase and sale agreement from the **seller** perspective. It is designed for use by AI agents conducting contract review on behalf of institutional sellers disposing of income-producing commercial real estate ($50M+ transactions).

---

## Risk of Loss Allocation (Pre-Closing Responsibility)

### Preferred Position

Seller's preferred position is that risk of loss shifts to Buyer as early as possible — ideally upon expiration of the diligence period or, at minimum, that the contractual framework limits Seller's exposure by establishing high materiality thresholds and short election periods. While market practice in institutional deals places risk on Seller through Closing, the Seller should ensure the allocation is implemented through a structured framework (material/immaterial distinction with mandatory proceed) rather than an unqualified statement that "Seller bears all risk."

**Preferred framework (Seller-favorable):**

> "Risk of loss for damage to or condemnation of the Property shall be governed exclusively by this Article. The provisions of the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act (or equivalent state statute) shall not apply to this Agreement. If a casualty or condemnation event occurs prior to Closing that does not constitute a Material Casualty or Material Taking (as defined herein), Buyer shall proceed to Closing without reduction in the Purchase Price (except for the credits and assignments expressly provided herein). If a Material Casualty or Material Taking occurs, Buyer shall have a limited election right as set forth below."

The Seller's goal is not to avoid all risk but to ensure that: (a) only truly material events give Buyer a termination right, (b) for immaterial events Buyer must proceed to Closing, and (c) the credit/assignment mechanics fully discharge Seller's obligations.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Accept that risk allocation through Closing is market standard, but ensure the framework is structured (material vs. immaterial distinction) rather than giving Buyer a blanket termination right for any loss.
- The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 12) and the Detailed Seller Side form (Sections 6.3-6.5) both establish a structured material/immaterial framework — this is the model to follow.
- Resist Buyer's attempt to insert language stating that "Seller bears all risk of loss" without the material/immaterial framework. Such language could be interpreted to give Buyer a termination right for any loss, no matter how trivial.
- Agree to UVPRA waiver only if the contractual framework is comprehensive and replaces the statute entirely. The waiver is neutral — it benefits both parties by removing ambiguity.
- Ensure Seller's obligation to maintain insurance is framed as "substantially as currently insured" (per the Detailed Seller Side form at Section 6.6(c)) — not as an obligation to maintain specific minimum coverage levels dictated by Buyer.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Risk should be entirely on Seller through Closing, with Buyer retaining a broad termination right for any material event and full control over the materiality determination.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept that Seller bears risk of loss through Closing, implemented through the material/immaterial framework with a commercially reasonable materiality threshold (see next section).
2. Accept UVPRA waiver as a reciprocal provision.
3. Resist any language giving Buyer a termination right for immaterial events — the mandatory proceed with credit/assignment is Seller's key protection.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — If the risk allocation provision is drafted too broadly, Buyer can use a minor casualty (a broken window, a small water leak) as a pretext to terminate a deal that has become uneconomic for other reasons. The material/immaterial framework prevents this.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Class A office buildings have higher per-SF improvement values, so Seller should push for a higher dollar materiality threshold to reflect the building's overall value.
- **Industrial:** Warehouse properties have lower improvement values per SF. Seller should accept a lower absolute dollar threshold that still represents a meaningful percentage of value.
- **Retail:** Multi-tenant retail properties face cascading co-tenancy risk. Seller should resist any provision that ties materiality to tenant lease termination rights, as this amplifies a minor physical event into a deal-termination trigger.
- **Multifamily:** Seller should resist unit-count-based materiality triggers (e.g., "damage to more than X% of units") because temporary displacement is easily managed with rental insurance.
- **Data Center:** The extreme value density of data centers means that even low dollar thresholds capture significant physical events. Seller should push for a threshold calibrated as a percentage of purchase price, not a fixed dollar amount.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York:** Section 5-1311 GOL waiver is standard. Agree to this without resistance.
- **California:** Cal. Civ. Code Section 1662 favors buyer under equitable conversion. Agree to waive but ensure the contractual framework is the exclusive risk allocation mechanism.
- **Illinois:** 765 ILCS 65/1 (UVPRA). The IL Pro-Buyer form's override language is acceptable as long as Seller's contractual protections (high threshold, short election period, deemed waiver) are preserved.

## Material vs. Immaterial Casualty Threshold

### Preferred Position

Seller should negotiate for the highest possible materiality threshold, defined as a fixed dollar amount determined by Seller or Seller's designated contractor. Below the threshold, Buyer must proceed to Closing with only a credit/assignment of proceeds. Above the threshold, Buyer gets a limited, time-bound election right.

**Preferred thresholds for institutional deals ($50M+):**

- Fixed dollar amount: $2,500,000 (per the Detailed Seller Side form) — representing approximately 2.5-5% of a $50M-$100M purchase price
- Alternatively: 5% of the Purchase Price
- Determination by: "a third party contractor selected by Seller" (per the Detailed Seller Side form at the definition of "Material Casualty")

**Precedent comparison:**

| Form | Threshold | Who Determines |
|---|---|---|
| UNICO Buyer Side (Section 12) | $500,000 | "Insured cost to repair" |
| UNICO Seller Side (Section 12) | $1,000,000 | "Insured cost to repair" |
| Detailed Seller Side (Section 6.3) | $2,500,000 | "Third party contractor selected by Seller" |
| Meadows/Seller-Skewed (Section 6.3) | Blank/TBD | "Reasonably determined by Seller" |
| Seller (Income Property) (Section 9) | Blank/TBD | Not specified |
| IL Pro-Buyer (Section 17.01) | [__]% of Purchase Price | Arbitration for disputes |

### Key Negotiation Points

- **The dollar amount is the most important negotiation point in the entire casualty section.** Every dollar below the threshold forces Buyer to close; every dollar above gives Buyer a walk-away right. Seller should set the threshold as high as commercially defensible.
- **Determination methodology should favor Seller.** The Detailed Seller Side form uses "a third party contractor selected by Seller" — this is the preferred approach because Seller controls the selection of the estimator. At minimum, resist Buyer's demand for a mutually selected contractor.
- **Use "insured cost to repair" as the metric, not "cost to repair."** The "insured cost to repair" metric (used in both UNICO forms) favors Seller because it is limited to what insurance covers — if the property is underinsured for a particular peril, the insured cost may be lower than the actual cost. If Buyer pushes for "cost to repair," counter with "estimated cost to repair as determined by Seller's contractor."
- **Resist GLA-based, tenant-impact-based, or temporal triggers.** Buyer will push for alternative materiality triggers based on percentage of GLA affected, impact on Major Tenants, or estimated restoration timeline. These alternative triggers are unpredictable and can convert a modest physical event into a "material" casualty. Seller should insist that materiality is measured solely by the dollar cost to repair.
- **Resist access-impairment triggers or limit their scope.** Both UNICO forms include access impairment as an independent materiality trigger. If Seller must accept this, define "access impairment" narrowly: "permanent and complete impairment of all vehicular access to the Property" — not temporary lane closures, partial access restrictions, or pedestrian access limitations.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The threshold should be low ($500K-$1M) and measured by the full cost to restore (not insured cost), with alternative triggers for GLA impact, tenant impact, and access impairment.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Reduce the threshold from $2.5M to $1.5M-$2M, but retain Seller's contractor as the determination methodology and reject alternative triggers.
2. Accept a percentage-based threshold (2-3% of Purchase Price) instead of a fixed dollar amount if it produces a higher effective threshold for the specific deal.
3. Accept access impairment as an independent trigger, but define it narrowly (permanent, complete vehicular access impairment only).
4. If Buyer insists on a tenant-impact trigger, limit it to: (a) actual delivery of a lease termination notice (not mere existence of a termination right) by (b) a Major Tenant representing more than 50% of the Property's gross rental income, within (c) the Buyer's election period.
5. Accept "cost to repair" (instead of "insured cost to repair") if the determination is still made by Seller's contractor.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — The materiality threshold is Seller's primary defense against deal retrade or termination following a casualty event. A low threshold gives Buyer a free option to walk away from a deal that may have become unattractive for reasons unrelated to the casualty. Seller should defend a high threshold aggressively.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Push for $2.5M+ threshold. Office restoration costs are well-documented and estimable, supporting a higher fixed-dollar threshold.
- **Industrial:** A $1.5M-$2M threshold is defensible for most industrial properties given lower per-SF improvement costs. Push for a higher threshold for cold storage, R&D, or specialized manufacturing facilities.
- **Retail:** Push for $2M+ threshold. Resist co-tenancy-based triggers.
- **Multifamily:** Push for $1.5M-$2M threshold. Resist unit-count triggers.
- **Data Center:** Push for a percentage-based threshold (3-5% of Purchase Price) rather than a fixed dollar amount, given the extreme value density.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** The materiality threshold is entirely negotiated. No statute defines it.

---

## Material vs. Immaterial Condemnation Threshold

### Preferred Position

Seller should negotiate for a high condemnation materiality threshold, determined by Seller's reasonable judgment, measured by diminution in property value (not by the amount of the condemnation award, which may be higher than the actual diminution in value to Seller).

**Preferred threshold:**

- Dollar diminution in value exceeding $2,500,000, as determined in "Seller's reasonable judgment" (per the Detailed Seller Side form definition of "Material Taking")
- Alternatively: diminution in value exceeding 5% of the Purchase Price

**Precedent comparison:**

| Form | Threshold | Who Determines |
|---|---|---|
| UNICO Buyer Side (Section 12) | $500,000 | Not specified |
| UNICO Seller Side (Section 12) | $1,000,000 | Not specified |
| Detailed Seller Side (Section 6.4) | $2,500,000 diminution in value | "Seller's reasonable judgment" |
| Meadows/Seller-Skewed (Section 6.4) | $3,000,000 decrease in value | "Reasonably determined by Buyer" |
| Seller (Income Property) (Section 9) | "Material portion" rendering unsuitable | "Reasonably determined by Buyer" |
| IL Pro-Buyer (Section 17.01) | [__]% of Purchase Price | Arbitration for access disputes |

### Key Negotiation Points

- **"Seller's reasonable judgment" is the preferred determination standard.** The Detailed Seller Side form uses this standard for the Material Taking definition. If Seller loses the determination, the worst outcome is a fact-finder reviewing the reasonableness of Seller's judgment — a high bar for Buyer to overcome.
- Note that the Meadows form gives the determination to Buyer: "reasonably determined by Buyer." Seller should never accept this framing. Push for Seller's determination or, at worst, mutual determination.
- **Diminution in value (not area affected) should be the metric.** A road-widening taking of 500 SF from a 200,000 SF industrial site may have negligible value impact. Seller should resist area-based triggers.
- **Resist parking, utility, and access triggers.** Buyer will push for independent triggers based on loss of parking, utility access, or vehicular access. Seller should fold these into the dollar diminution test rather than allowing them as standalone triggers. If Seller must accept an access trigger, define it as narrowly as possible: "permanent loss of all vehicular access from a public road."
- **Exclude "threatened" condemnation.** Seller should resist Buyer's attempt to trigger termination rights based on mere threats or preliminary governmental inquiries. Require actual filing of formal condemnation proceedings.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The condemnation threshold should be measured by multiple metrics (area, access, parking, value) and determined by Buyer or a neutral party.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Reduce the dollar threshold to $1.5M-$2M but retain "Seller's reasonable judgment" as the determination standard.
2. Accept "mutual reasonable determination" (with disputes resolved by an independent MAI appraiser at shared cost) instead of Seller's sole determination.
3. Accept an access impairment trigger (narrowly defined) as an independent trigger alongside the dollar threshold.
4. If Buyer insists on a low dollar threshold, negotiate for a reciprocal provision: if a condemnation occurs that gives Buyer a termination right and Buyer terminates, Seller retains all condemnation award proceeds.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Similar to casualty, the condemnation threshold controls whether Buyer gets a walk-away right. Additionally, condemnation takings are permanent and may affect the property's highest-and-best use. Seller needs a high threshold to prevent Buyer from using a minor taking (utility easement, sidewalk widening) as a deal exit.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Partial takings affecting the building footprint are rare; partial takings affecting parking or setbacks are more common. Seller should resist area-based triggers.
- **Industrial:** Road-widening and utility easement takings are common for industrial properties. Seller should push for a high threshold because these minor takings often have minimal value impact.
- **Retail:** Pad site and outparcel takings can have disproportionate value impact. Seller should consider whether a percentage-of-value threshold is more defensible than a fixed dollar amount.
- **Multifamily:** Amenity area takings (pool, parking) are the primary risk. Seller should push for a high dollar threshold.
- **Data Center:** Any taking affecting utility infrastructure is existential. Seller may need to accept a lower threshold for utility-related takings.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Condemnation materiality is entirely contractual. State eminent domain statutes govern the taking itself but not the PSA allocation.

## Buyer's Termination Right — Seller's Defensive Provisions

### Preferred Position

If Seller must concede a termination right for material events, the right should be: (a) time-limited with a short election period, (b) subject to a deemed-waiver mechanism, (c) conditioned on Buyer's compliance with procedural requirements, and (d) the exclusive remedy (precluding damages claims or specific performance related to the casualty).

**Preferred framework:**

1. Seller provides notice of the casualty/condemnation event.
2. Buyer has 10 days (calendar days, not business days) to deliver a written termination election.
3. If Buyer does not deliver written notice of termination within 10 days, Buyer is **deemed to have irrevocably elected to proceed** to Closing.
4. If Buyer terminates, the Earnest Money Deposit is returned (but Seller has no other obligations — no cost reimbursement, no breakage fee).
5. If Buyer proceeds, Seller assigns proceeds/credits deductible and has no further obligations regarding the casualty.

**Precedent comparison:**

| Form | Election Period | Deemed Waiver? | Calendar or Business Days? |
|---|---|---|---|
| UNICO Buyer Side (Section 12.2) | 10 Business Days | Yes | Business Days |
| UNICO Seller Side (Section 12.2) | 10 Business Days | Yes | Business Days |
| Detailed Seller Side (Section 6.3-6.4) | 10 days | Yes | Calendar (implied) |
| Meadows (Section 6.4) | 10 Business Days | Implied | Business Days |
| IL Pro-Buyer (Section 17.01) | [__] days | Yes | TBD |

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Calendar days vs. business days:** Push for calendar days. Ten calendar days is approximately 7 business days — a meaningful acceleration. The Detailed Seller Side form uses "ten (10) days" without specifying "business days," which should be interpreted as calendar days.
- **Deemed waiver is non-negotiable from Seller's perspective.** If Buyer does not timely elect, Buyer must close. This prevents Buyer from "running out the clock" while deciding whether to proceed. All precedent forms include this mechanism.
- **Resist Buyer's attempt to condition the election period on receipt of a "complete" notice.** Buyer will argue that the election period should not commence until Seller delivers a notice containing detailed cost estimates, insurance information, and tenant impact analysis. Seller should resist — the notice should be a simple factual description of the event, and the clock should start running immediately upon delivery.
- **Resist cost reimbursement upon termination.** No precedent form provides for Buyer cost reimbursement upon casualty/condemnation termination. This is not market, and Seller should reject it firmly.
- **Resist any "re-opener" mechanism.** Buyer may request a second election period if subsequent information reveals greater damage. Seller should reject this — the deemed-waiver must be final and irrevocable.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** 10 days is insufficient to evaluate complex casualties, especially for large or specialized properties. Buyer needs time to consult with engineers, insurers, and lenders. The election period should not commence until Seller delivers detailed notice.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Extend the election period from 10 to 15 days (calendar days), but retain the deemed-waiver mechanism.
2. Accept 10 business days (approximately 14 calendar days) as a compromise, consistent with the UNICO forms.
3. Accept that Seller's notice must be "reasonably detailed" (per the Detailed Seller Side form at Section 6.6(e)), but reject Buyer's demand for a laundry list of required notice contents as a condition to starting the clock.
4. If Buyer insists on a "complete notice" requirement, define "complete notice" narrowly: (a) description of the event, (b) Seller's good-faith estimate of the cost to repair or diminution in value, and (c) identification of the affected area.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — The election period and deemed-waiver mechanism are Seller's most important procedural protections. Without a deemed waiver, Buyer can hold Seller hostage indefinitely by neither proceeding nor terminating. Seller must defend these provisions.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The election mechanics are structurally identical across asset types. Seller may accept slightly longer election periods for data centers and specialized properties due to the complexity of damage assessment.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Courts enforce deemed-waiver provisions as written. There is no equitable exception to a contractual deemed-waiver.

## Seller's Notice Obligations — Limiting Exposure

### Preferred Position

Seller should accept a notice obligation but ensure it is: (a) triggered by actual knowledge only (not constructive or imputed knowledge), (b) limited to material events, (c) defined by a "promptly" or "reasonably promptly" standard (no specific day count), and (d) not burdened with detailed content requirements that could be used to argue the notice was deficient.

**Preferred sample language:**

> "Seller shall promptly give Buyer a reasonably detailed written notice of: (a) any material fire, material flood or other material casualty with respect to the Property of which Seller obtains actual knowledge; and (b) any condemnation proceeding affecting the Property of which Seller obtains actual knowledge."

This language is drawn directly from the Detailed Seller Side form (Section 6.6(e)).

### Key Negotiation Points

- **"Actual knowledge" qualifier is essential.** Seller should not be responsible for events it has not learned about. The Detailed Seller Side form limits notice to events "of which Seller obtains actual knowledge." Resist Buyer's demand for constructive knowledge ("knew or should have known") or imputed knowledge from property managers.
- **"Promptly" is preferable to a specific day count.** "Promptly" gives Seller reasonable flexibility and avoids arguments that a notice was "late." Resist Buyer's demand for "within 2 business days" — this creates a bright-line default risk.
- **"Reasonably detailed" is preferable to a specific content checklist.** The Detailed Seller Side form uses "reasonably detailed" — this is the right standard. Resist Buyer's demand for a checklist (cost estimates, insurance details, tenant impact analysis) because each required element creates a potential argument that the notice was deficient and the election period has not commenced.
- **Limit the notice obligation to "material" events.** The Detailed Seller Side form limits notice to "material fire, material flood or other material casualty." This avoids Seller having to notify Buyer of every minor maintenance issue.
- **Resist any obligation to provide ongoing updates.** Buyer may request continuing disclosure of revised damage estimates, insurance adjuster reports, and tenant correspondence. Seller's obligation should be limited to a single initial notice.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Seller must provide prompt, detailed notice of all casualty and condemnation events (not just "material" ones) because the buyer cannot exercise its rights without information. Buyer will also argue the election period should not commence until "complete" notice is delivered.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept notice of all casualties (not just material ones) but retain the "promptly" standard and "reasonably detailed" content requirement.
2. Accept a specific timing requirement (e.g., "within 5 business days") if Seller's notice can be preliminary and need not include cost estimates. Seller can provide a supplemental notice with estimates later, but the election period clock starts with the initial notice.
3. If Buyer insists on tying the election period to a "complete" notice, define "completeness" very narrowly and include a cure mechanism: if Seller's notice is incomplete, Buyer must notify Seller of the deficiency within 3 days, and Seller has 3 days to supplement.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — An overly burdensome notice obligation creates two risks for Seller: (1) Seller may inadvertently trigger notice obligations by disclosing minor events, giving Buyer information to manufacture a termination argument; and (2) if the notice is deemed "deficient," Buyer may argue the election period never commenced, extending Buyer's termination window indefinitely.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The notice framework is structurally identical across asset types.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **No jurisdiction-specific rules govern PSA notice obligations for casualty/condemnation.** This is entirely contractual.

---

## Insurance Assignment/Credit Mechanics — Protecting Seller

### Preferred Position

When Buyer elects to proceed following a casualty (or is required to proceed for an immaterial casualty), Seller's obligation should be limited to providing a credit for proceeds actually received and an assignment of claims for proceeds not yet received. Seller should retain the right to deduct all reasonable pre-Closing expenditures from the credit.

**Preferred framework:**

1. **Proceeds already received:** Credit to Buyer equal to proceeds received, **less** all amounts reasonably expended by Seller for (a) emergency and permanent repairs, (b) barricades and temporary protections, (c) insurance claim prosecution costs, and (d) business interruption losses suffered by Seller during the pre-Closing period. The Detailed Seller Side form uses "Seller-Allocated Amounts" — Seller should define this term to capture all legitimate deductions.
2. **Proceeds not yet received:** Assignment to Buyer of the insurance claim, with Buyer obligated to reimburse Seller for Seller-Allocated Amounts within 3 business days of receipt of the proceeds. The Detailed Seller Side form (Section 6.5(b)) establishes this mechanism.
3. **No Purchase Price reduction.** The credit/assignment is the exclusive remedy — Buyer does not receive a separate Purchase Price reduction. The Detailed Seller Side form expressly states: "without a reduction in the Purchase Price except as provided for in Section 6.5."

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Maximize the "Seller-Allocated Amounts" deduction.** This is Seller's vehicle for recovering all pre-Closing costs associated with the casualty. Define it to include: (a) all repair and restoration costs (not just emergency repairs), (b) temporary relocation costs for displaced tenants, (c) insurance claim prosecution costs (adjusters, attorneys, engineers), (d) business interruption losses for the pre-Closing period, and (e) any other costs reasonably incurred in connection with the casualty.
- **Business interruption proceeds for the pre-Closing period belong to Seller.** Seller suffered the loss of income during its ownership period and is entitled to retain BI proceeds for that period. The apportionment should be on a per diem basis as of the Closing Date.
- **Deductible credit should be limited to "net of amounts recoverable from tenants."** Both UNICO forms include this limitation: "the amount of any insurance deductible not recoverable under the Leases." If tenants are responsible for deductibles under NNN leases, Seller should not have to credit the full deductible amount to Buyer.
- **Resist Buyer's demand for Seller to bear the full deductible regardless of tenant recovery.** Seller's exposure should be limited to the unrecoverable portion.
- **Assignment of claims (not just proceeds) is acceptable if Seller is released from further liability.** Once Seller assigns the insurance claim to Buyer, Seller should have no continuing obligation regarding the claim and no liability for Buyer's failure to prosecute or collect.
- **Require Buyer to reimburse Seller-Allocated Amounts from assigned proceeds.** The Detailed Seller Side form requires this reimbursement within 3 business days of receipt. This is essential.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Seller's deductions should be limited to documented emergency repairs only. BI proceeds for the pre-Closing period should be separately accounted and not deducted from the property damage credit. The full deductible should be credited regardless of tenant recovery.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept limiting deductions to "documented, out-of-pocket costs" but include all categories listed above (not just emergency repairs). Require Buyer to provide Seller with copies of receipts.
2. Accept a separate accounting of BI proceeds (Seller retains pre-Closing BI; Buyer receives post-Closing BI) rather than a general deduction from the property damage credit.
3. Accept full deductible credit if the deductible is modest (under $100,000). For high-deductible policies (earthquake, named storm), insist on the "net of tenant recovery" limitation.
4. Accept a mutual cooperation framework for post-Closing insurance claims rather than a clean assignment with reimbursement.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — The credit/assignment mechanics determine how much of the insurance recovery Seller must share with Buyer. If Seller-Allocated Amounts are defined too narrowly, Seller may be forced to absorb significant pre-Closing costs that should properly reduce the credit to Buyer. If the post-Closing reimbursement mechanism is not enforceable, Seller may never recover its costs from assigned proceeds.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** BI/rent loss proceeds for office properties can be substantial. Seller should aggressively protect its right to retain pre-Closing BI proceeds.
- **Industrial:** NNN lease structures mean tenants often bear deductible and certain repair costs. Seller should ensure the "net of tenant recovery" deductible limitation is included.
- **Retail:** Percentage rent BI coverage may not exist. Seller should not be credited for uncovered BI losses.
- **Multifamily:** Tenant relocation costs mandated by local ordinances may be significant. Include these in Seller-Allocated Amounts.
- **Data Center:** Equipment replacement costs can be enormous and time-consuming to settle with insurers. Seller should ensure it is not penalized for pending claims.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Insurance policy anti-assignment clauses may require insurer consent for assignment of claims. The PSA should address responsibility for obtaining consent (Seller should require Buyer to bear the cost and effort, with Seller cooperating).

---

## Condemnation Proceeding Management

### Preferred Position

Seller should retain sole control over all condemnation proceedings affecting the Property through Closing, including the right to settle, negotiate, and compromise condemnation awards without Buyer's consent. Seller is the fee owner and the party-in-interest in the condemnation proceeding.

**Preferred framework:**

> "Prior to Closing, Seller shall have the sole right to manage, negotiate, and settle any condemnation proceedings affecting the Property. Seller shall have no obligation to obtain Buyer's consent to any settlement, compromise, or negotiation of any condemnation award. At Closing, Seller shall assign to Buyer all of Seller's right, title, and interest in any pending condemnation proceedings and any awards not yet received, subject to the Seller-Allocated Amounts."

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Resist Buyer's demand for consent over settlements.** If Seller must obtain Buyer's consent to settle, Buyer can effectively hold the condemnation award hostage by withholding consent, delaying settlement, and creating pressure on Seller to concede price reductions.
- **Resist Buyer's demand for "participation rights" in condemnation proceedings.** Buyer's participation adds complexity, delay, and cost without benefit to Seller. Before Closing, Buyer is not the property owner and has no standing in the condemnation proceeding.
- **If Seller must concede some Buyer involvement, limit it to:** (a) copies of material filings and correspondence (information rights only), and (b) a right to provide written input that Seller will "consider in good faith" (but not a consent right).
- **Seller should retain all condemnation awards for any taking that is below the materiality threshold** — these immaterial takings are Seller's responsibility, and Seller should not have to share immaterial condemnation awards with Buyer.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer is the party that will own the property after Closing and has the most at stake in the condemnation outcome. Buyer should have consent rights over settlements and the right to participate in proceedings.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept a "right to participate" (attend hearings, review filings) without consent rights over settlements. This gives Buyer information without control.
2. Accept a consent right for settlements, but only for settlements below a specified percentage of the appraised diminution in value (e.g., Buyer's consent required only for settlements at less than 75% of the appraised value). This prevents lowball settlements while preserving Seller's flexibility.
3. Accept Buyer's consent "not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed" for material takings, while retaining sole discretion for immaterial takings.
4. Accept Buyer's sole and absolute consent only if the condemnation proceeding was initiated after the Effective Date (not for pre-existing proceedings disclosed during diligence).

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — The practical risk is limited because most condemnation proceedings take years to resolve, and the Property will likely close long before any award is finalized. The assignment-at-Closing mechanism addresses post-Closing awards. The primary risk is delay: if Buyer has consent rights, it may use them strategically to delay Closing or extract price concessions.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The condemnation management framework is structurally identical. Seller should adjust its settlement flexibility based on the property type and the nature of the taking.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** State eminent domain statutes govern who has standing in condemnation proceedings. Generally, only the fee owner (Seller, pre-Closing) has standing. Buyer's participation rights are contractual and do not create statutory standing.

## Seller's Restoration Option

### Preferred Position

Seller should retain the option (but not the obligation) to restore the Property following a casualty. This option is valuable because it allows Seller to manage minor damage and present a "clean" property at Closing, avoiding the credit/assignment mechanics altogether.

**Preferred framework:**

> "Seller shall have the option, but not the obligation, to restore or repair any damage to the Property arising from any casualty event. If Seller elects to restore, Seller shall notify Buyer of such election and shall complete restoration prior to the Closing Date (as such date may be extended by Seller pursuant to this Section). Seller shall have the right to extend the Closing Date for a period of up to [90] days to accommodate such restoration. If Seller substantially completes restoration prior to the extended Closing Date, Buyer shall proceed to Closing at the full Purchase Price without any credit for insurance proceeds or deductibles. If Seller does not substantially complete restoration prior to the extended Closing Date, Buyer shall have the option to (a) waive the restoration condition and close, or (b) terminate this Agreement."

### Key Negotiation Points

- **The restoration option gives Seller control over the post-casualty process.** Instead of crediting insurance proceeds and losing deal value, Seller can restore and close at the full Purchase Price.
- **Closing extension for restoration is essential.** Seller needs time to complete the work. A 60-90 day extension is reasonable for most casualties.
- **"Substantial completion" should be defined by Seller's architect or contractor** — not by Buyer's standards. "Substantial completion" means the work is sufficiently complete for occupancy, with only punch-list items remaining.
- **Seller should retain the insurance proceeds during restoration.** If Seller is bearing the cost of restoration, Seller collects and uses the insurance proceeds directly — no credit to Buyer is needed.
- **Resist Buyer's demand for approval over contractor, scope, or standards.** This is Seller's property until Closing, and Seller should control the restoration process.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Seller-managed restoration is risky for Buyer because Seller has diminishing incentives to do quality work. Buyer should approve the contractor, scope, and quality standards. Alternatively, Buyer should receive the proceeds and manage restoration itself.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept Buyer's right to inspect restoration progress and provide written comments that Seller will "consider in good faith" — but Seller retains final authority over all restoration decisions.
2. Accept a holdback mechanism: if restoration is substantially but not fully complete at Closing, Seller deposits 150% of the estimated cost to complete into escrow, which is released to Seller upon completion (with excess released to Buyer if Seller does not complete within a specified period).
3. Accept Buyer's right to approve the general contractor (approval not to be unreasonably withheld) but Seller controls scope and timeline.
4. If Buyer refuses to accept Seller-managed restoration, fall back to the standard credit/assignment framework — but negotiate the Seller-Allocated Amounts aggressively.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — The restoration option is valuable when Seller expects to complete restoration before Closing (or within a short extension), particularly for minor to moderate damage. The risk is that restoration takes longer or costs more than expected, potentially triggering the Closing extension or creating disputes over "substantial completion."

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Seller-managed restoration of office buildings is feasible for most casualty types. TI restoration should be excluded — Seller restores base building only.
- **Industrial:** Straightforward restoration (roof replacement, exterior wall repair) is well-suited for Seller management.
- **Retail:** Multi-tenant retail restoration involving individual tenant spaces is complex. Seller should limit its restoration obligation to common areas and base building.
- **Data Center:** Seller should not attempt data center restoration due to the specialized nature of the infrastructure. Fall back to credit/assignment framework.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Building permit requirements vary by jurisdiction.** Seller should confirm that permits can be obtained and restoration completed within the extension period. In some jurisdictions (NYC, SF, Chicago), permit processing times can extend restoration timelines significantly.

## Deductible Responsibility — Seller's Position

### Preferred Position

Seller should credit Buyer for the insurance deductible only to the extent the deductible is not recoverable from tenants under the Leases. This is the standard in the UNICO forms and is the market position.

**Preferred language:**

> "The amount of any insurance deductible not recoverable under the Leases" (from UNICO Buyer and Seller Side forms, Section 12.1).

### Key Negotiation Points

- **The "not recoverable under the Leases" limitation is critical for NNN properties.** In NNN and modified gross leases, tenants are often responsible for insurance deductibles. Seller should not credit Buyer for deductibles that Buyer can collect from tenants post-Closing.
- **For high-deductible policies (earthquake, named storm), resist crediting the full deductible.** These deductibles can be 5-15% of insured value. Seller should argue that (a) Buyer accepted the property's insurance profile during diligence, (b) the high-deductible policy was a deliberate cost-saving measure that lowered Seller's insurance premiums (benefiting Buyer through lower operating expenses), and (c) the deductible risk is inherent in the property's risk profile.
- **If Seller must credit the full deductible, cap it at the standard property insurance deductible.** Named storm, earthquake, and flood deductibles should be treated as separate risks.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The full deductible should be credited regardless of tenant recovery, because: (a) tenant recovery is uncertain, (b) pursuing tenants for deductible reimbursement post-Closing creates adversarial landlord-tenant relationships, and (c) risk of loss is on Seller.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept full deductible credit for the standard property insurance deductible (typically $25,000-$100,000) but cap the credit at that amount. Catastrophic peril deductibles are excluded.
2. Accept full deductible credit for all deductibles but require Buyer to credit back to Seller any amounts subsequently collected from tenants (with a surviving obligation).
3. Accept full deductible credit for all deductibles if the total deductible exposure is modest (under $250,000).

### Risk Assessment

**LOW-MEDIUM** — For standard deductibles ($25K-$100K), the financial exposure is manageable. For catastrophic peril deductibles, the exposure can be enormous, and Seller should resist bearing this cost.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Industrial (NNN):** Tenant deductible responsibility is common. Insist on the "net of tenant recovery" limitation.
- **Retail (NNN):** Same as industrial.
- **Office (gross lease):** Tenant deductible recovery is uncommon. Seller should expect to credit the full standard deductible.
- **Multifamily:** No tenant deductible recovery. Seller should expect to credit the full deductible.
- **Data Center:** Equipment breakdown deductibles can be high. Negotiate carefully.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **No jurisdiction-specific rules apply.**

## Uninsured Casualty — Seller's Defensive Provisions

### Preferred Position

Seller should limit its exposure for uninsured casualties. The Seller's preferred position is that if damage is not covered by insurance and does not exceed the materiality threshold, Buyer must proceed to Closing — and Seller's credit obligation should be limited to the actual cost of emergency repairs (not the full cost to restore).

**Preferred framework:**

> "If the Property suffers damage from an uninsured casualty that does not exceed the Material Casualty threshold, Buyer shall proceed to Closing at the full Purchase Price. Seller shall have no obligation to credit Buyer for uninsured loss, and Buyer's sole remedy shall be the credit for insurance proceeds (if any) and the deductible credit as provided herein."

For material uninsured casualties, Seller may concede Buyer's termination right but should resist providing a Purchase Price credit for the uninsured loss if Buyer elects to proceed.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Resist treating uninsured casualty as an independent termination trigger below the materiality threshold.** The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 12.2) treats uninsured damage as independently triggering the Major Loss termination right regardless of dollar amount — this is aggressive and Seller should push back.
- **If Seller must concede a termination right for uninsured casualties, establish a separate (higher) threshold.** For example: Buyer has a termination right for uninsured casualties exceeding $500,000 (separate from the $2.5M threshold for insured casualties).
- **Seller should NOT represent that insurance coverage is "adequate."** Buyer conducts its own insurance diligence and should assess adequacy itself. Seller's covenant should be limited to maintaining insurance "substantially as currently insured" — not guaranteeing coverage adequacy.
- **Include a "Seller nullification election" for uninsured casualties.** The IL Pro-Buyer form (Section 17.02) allows Seller to elect not to provide a credit for uninsured loss, which re-triggers Buyer's termination right. While this mechanism comes from a pro-buyer form, it actually protects Seller by giving Seller the choice: either credit the uninsured amount and keep the deal alive, or let Buyer terminate and avoid bearing the uninsured loss.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Any uninsured loss should give Buyer a termination right because Buyer receives no insurance offset. Seller chose its insurance program and should bear the consequences of gaps in coverage.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept that uninsured casualties exceeding the Material Casualty threshold give Buyer a termination right (this is consistent with the UNICO forms).
2. Accept that uninsured casualties below the threshold give Buyer a Purchase Price credit equal to the estimated cost of repair, but cap the credit at the Material Casualty threshold amount.
3. Accept the IL Pro-Buyer "Seller nullification election" — Seller retains the choice of whether to credit Buyer or allow termination.
4. If Buyer insists on a termination right for all uninsured casualties regardless of amount, require a de minimis exception ($100,000-$250,000).

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — Uninsured casualty is Seller's greatest financial exposure in the casualty section because there are no insurance proceeds to offset the loss. If Seller must provide a Purchase Price credit for the full uninsured amount, the credit comes directly out of Seller's proceeds. The financial impact can be substantial for perils with common coverage gaps (earthquake, flood, terrorism, mold).

### Asset-Type Variations

- **California (earthquake):** Earthquake insurance deductibles (10-15% of insured value) and the high cost of earthquake premiums mean many institutional sellers decline earthquake coverage or carry very high deductibles. This is a known market condition that Buyer should accept through diligence.
- **Coastal (flood/wind):** Similarly, flood and named-storm exclusions create coverage gaps that are market-standard in coastal areas.
- **Industrial (pollution):** Pollution liability arising from a fire or structural collapse is typically excluded from standard property policies. Seller should not be required to credit Buyer for environmental cleanup costs triggered by a casualty.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **No state law requires Seller to maintain specific insurance coverage types.** Seller's insurance obligation is entirely contractual.

## Business Interruption and Rent Loss Proceeds — Seller's Retention Rights

### Preferred Position

Seller should retain all business interruption and rent loss insurance proceeds allocable to the pre-Closing period. This is axiomatic: Seller suffered the loss of income and paid the premiums for the coverage period.

**Preferred framework:**

> "All business interruption and rent loss insurance proceeds shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer on a per diem basis as of the Closing Date. Proceeds allocable to the period prior to the Closing Date shall belong exclusively to Seller. Seller-Allocated Amounts (as defined herein) shall include business interruption and rent loss proceeds attributable to the pre-Closing period."

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Include BI/rent loss proceeds in the Seller-Allocated Amounts definition.** This is the cleanest way to protect Seller's rights.
- **The apportionment should be per diem, not based on actual rent collections.** Per diem is simpler and prevents disputes about whether specific rent collections are pre- or post-Closing.
- **Seller should retain BI proceeds even if the restoration period extends beyond Closing.** The pre-Closing BI proceeds represent Seller's actual loss of income during its ownership period — the fact that the restoration period extends past Closing does not change the allocation.
- **Resist Buyer's demand for all BI proceeds if Buyer is paying full Purchase Price.** Buyer may argue that since it is paying full price (without a reduction for the casualty), it should receive all BI proceeds. Respond that the credit/assignment mechanics already compensate Buyer for the property damage, and the BI proceeds are a separate compensation for Seller's income loss.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** If Buyer pays full Purchase Price and takes title to a damaged property, Buyer should receive all BI proceeds (including pre-Closing) because the BI proceeds compensate for the reduced income stream that Buyer is purchasing.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept per diem apportionment as of the Closing Date (market standard). Pre-Closing to Seller; post-Closing to Buyer.
2. If Buyer insists on retaining all BI proceeds, require a corresponding increase in the Seller-Allocated Amounts deducted from the property damage credit.
3. Accept a hybrid: BI proceeds for the first 60 days post-casualty belong to Seller; BI proceeds for the remainder of the restoration period are apportioned per diem based on the Closing Date.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — The financial impact depends on the length of the restoration period and the amount of rent loss. For a fully-leased office building, 3 months of rent loss can represent 2-3% of property value. Seller should ensure this allocation is express rather than leaving it to inference.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office/Retail:** BI proceeds are typically substantial due to high per-SF rents. Aggressive protection warranted.
- **Industrial (NNN):** Tenant may carry its own BI insurance. Seller's BI policy may provide limited coverage. Lower financial exposure for Seller.
- **Multifamily:** BI policies cover "fair rental value." Seller should ensure the apportionment captures this.
- **Data Center:** BI exposure is extreme. Seller should verify its BI coverage limits and ensure the PSA protects its share.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **No state law governs BI proceeds apportionment.** Entirely contractual.

## Tenant Lease Termination Rights — Seller's Defensive Provisions

### Preferred Position

Seller should resist any provision that ties PSA materiality to tenant lease termination rights. Tenant termination rights are a function of the Lease terms, which Buyer reviewed during diligence. A tenant's contractual right to terminate should not independently trigger a PSA termination right.

**Preferred framework:**

> "The existence or exercise of any tenant's right to terminate its Lease in connection with a casualty or condemnation event shall not independently constitute a Material Casualty or Material Taking and shall not give Buyer any right to terminate this Agreement except as expressly provided in this Article."

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Buyer accepted the Lease terms during diligence.** Tenant casualty termination provisions are disclosed in the Leases, which Buyer reviewed and accepted by waiving the diligence contingency. Seller should not bear additional risk for provisions that Buyer knowingly accepted.
- **Tenant termination rights are speculative.** The existence of a termination right does not mean the tenant will exercise it. Many tenants with termination rights choose to stay, especially if they have favorable below-market rents or have made significant leasehold improvements.
- **If Seller must concede a tenant-termination trigger, limit it significantly:**
  - Only actual delivery of a termination notice (not mere existence of a right) by the tenant
  - Only for Major Tenants (not all tenants)
  - Only if the terminating tenant represents more than 50% of the Property's gross rental income
  - The termination notice must be irrevocable (not subject to withdrawal)
- **None of the Seller-side precedent forms include a tenant-termination trigger.** The NY Negotiation Checklist recommends this from the buyer perspective, but no actual form includes it.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The loss of a major tenant destroys the value of the acquisition. A tenant termination triggered by a pre-Closing casualty is a material change in the Property's economic profile.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Reject the tenant-termination trigger entirely. This is a legitimate negotiating position — no precedent form includes it, and the credit/assignment mechanics already compensate Buyer for the damage.
2. Accept the trigger only for a single-tenant property where the sole tenant's termination would leave Buyer with a vacant, damaged building.
3. Accept the trigger only if: (a) the tenant has actually delivered an irrevocable termination notice, (b) the tenant represents more than 50% of gross rental income, and (c) the casualty independently exceeds the Material Casualty threshold.
4. Accept the trigger but convert it from a termination right to a Purchase Price reduction right — Buyer proceeds to Closing at a reduced price based on the capitalized value of the lost income.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — A tenant-termination trigger can convert a minor physical event (that does not independently exceed the materiality threshold) into a deal-killing event. This effectively gives Buyer a lower, hidden materiality threshold based on Lease provisions that Seller cannot control. For diversified multi-tenant properties, this risk is manageable; for single-tenant or anchor-dependent properties, it is significant.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Single-tenant NNN:** The tenant IS the deal. Seller may need to accept some form of tenant-termination trigger for single-tenant properties, but should negotiate the most restrictive formulation possible.
- **Office/Retail with Major Tenant:** Resist the trigger. If the Major Tenant represents less than 50% of income, the property retains substantial value even if the Major Tenant terminates.
- **Multifamily:** Not applicable (no single tenant drives value).
- **Data Center:** Single-tenant data center leases often have aggressive termination provisions. Seller should resist the trigger or limit it to situations where the tenant has irrevocably terminated and the property cannot be re-leased within a reasonable timeframe.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Tenant termination rights are governed by the Lease terms and applicable landlord-tenant law. No state law independently creates a PSA termination right based on tenant actions.

## Closing Extension — Seller's Defensive Provisions

### Preferred Position

Seller should resist automatic closing extensions for casualty/condemnation events. Extensions create uncertainty, may jeopardize Seller's 1031 exchange timelines, loan payoff commitments, and reinvestment plans. If an extension must be conceded, it should be (a) Seller's election (not automatic), (b) limited in duration, and (c) conditioned on Buyer's continued obligation to close.

**Preferred framework (if Seller must concede some extension):**

> "Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation), exercisable by written notice to Buyer, to extend the Closing Date for one or more periods of up to sixty (60) days in total to provide additional time for the fulfillment of casualty- or condemnation-related conditions."

This language is drawn from the Detailed Seller Side form (Section 6.1), which gives Seller (not Buyer) the extension right.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **The extension should be Seller's right, not Buyer's.** The Detailed Seller Side form gives Seller the right to extend for up to 60 days. This protects Seller's option to restore and close at full price, while preventing Buyer from using extensions to delay closing.
- **Resist automatic extensions.** Buyer will push for automatic extensions upon any casualty/condemnation event. This is unnecessary — if the event is immaterial, Buyer must close on schedule; if material, Buyer can terminate. There is no scenario (from Seller's perspective) where an automatic extension benefits Seller.
- **If Buyer receives any extension right, cap it strictly.** Maximum 15-30 days, and only to the extent necessary to accommodate the election period (i.e., if the casualty occurs within the election period of the Closing Date).
- **Extensions should not trigger additional interest on Buyer's deposit or penalty to Seller.** Seller should not bear a financial cost for exercising a legitimate extension right.
- **Seller's 1031 exchange timeline must be protected.** If Seller is conducting a 1031 exchange, the PSA should provide that the extension right does not operate to extend the Closing Date beyond Seller's exchange identification deadline (45 days) or exchange completion deadline (180 days) without Seller's consent.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The Closing Date must be automatically extended upon any casualty/condemnation event to give Buyer time to evaluate the situation, consult with its lender, and restructure the closing.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept a Buyer closing extension of up to 15 days, but only if the casualty/condemnation occurs within 15 days of the scheduled Closing Date and only to accommodate the election period.
2. Accept the Meadows approach: "If necessary, the Closing Date shall be postponed until Seller has given any notice to Buyer required by this Section and the period of [10] business days described in this Section has expired." This limits the extension to the notice + election period.
3. Accept an automatic extension of 30 days for material events only, with an outside date beyond which either party may terminate.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM** — Closing extensions create uncertainty and may interfere with Seller's reinvestment or exchange timelines. However, a modest extension to accommodate the election mechanics is reasonable and can prevent a mechanical default by Buyer that leads to costly litigation.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The extension framework is structurally identical. Seller should calibrate the maximum extension period based on its own reinvestment timeline, not the property type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **1031 exchange deadlines are federal tax requirements (26 U.S.C. Section 1031)** that cannot be extended by agreement. Seller must ensure the PSA extension provision does not override its exchange deadlines.

---

## Seller's Covenant to Maintain Insurance — Scope Limitation

### Preferred Position

Seller should accept a covenant to maintain insurance but limit it to maintaining coverage "substantially as currently insured" — not to any minimum coverage specifications dictated by Buyer.

**Preferred language:**

> "At all times prior to Closing, Seller shall insure the Property substantially as it is currently insured." (From the Detailed Seller Side form, Section 6.6(c).)

Alternatively:

> "Seller shall maintain all casualty and liability insurance currently in force with respect to the Property." (From the Seller (Income Property) form, Section 7(d).)

### Key Negotiation Points

- **"Substantially as currently insured" is the correct standard.** This allows for normal policy renewals, carrier changes, and minor coverage adjustments while maintaining the general insurance profile.
- **Resist Buyer's demand for minimum coverage specifications.** Buyer may request that Seller maintain specific coverage types (earthquake, terrorism, cyber), specific limits, or specific deductible levels. This is overreaching — Seller maintains its standard insurance program, and Buyer assesses adequacy during diligence.
- **Resist "additional insured" or "loss payee" requirements.** Buyer (or Buyer's lender) may request to be added as an additional insured or loss payee on Seller's policies before Closing. This is uncommon in arm's-length sales and creates complications with Seller's carrier.
- **Resist any obligation to carry insurance Seller does not currently carry.** If Seller does not carry earthquake insurance (common in California), the covenant to maintain "as currently insured" properly excludes earthquake coverage.
- **The Seller (Income Property) form includes a Seller-favorable disclaimer:** "Nothing in this Section 6.3 shall be deemed to constitute an obligation on the part of Seller to carry or maintain any insurance of any kind whatsoever pertaining to the Property." This is aggressive but reflects a legitimate position: Seller's insurance maintenance is a business decision, and the PSA credit/assignment mechanics function regardless of coverage levels.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Seller must maintain specific minimum coverages and cannot reduce coverage or increase deductibles without consent. Buyer should be added as additional insured.

**Acceptable fallback positions (in priority order):**

1. Accept "substantially as currently insured" with a requirement to notify Buyer of any material changes in coverage, carrier, or deductible.
2. Accept a covenant not to "materially reduce" coverage or "materially increase" deductibles without Buyer's consent (consent not to be unreasonably withheld).
3. Provide Buyer with a certificate of insurance upon request but resist adding Buyer as additional insured or loss payee.
4. Accept the "additional insured" request only if Buyer bears the cost of any additional premium.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — This is a standard covenant that Seller would comply with in the ordinary course of business regardless of the PSA. The risk arises only if Buyer attempts to use the covenant to impose new insurance requirements or control Seller's insurance program.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The insurance maintenance covenant is structurally identical across property types.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **No state law requires Seller to maintain specific insurance coverage.** This is entirely contractual.
