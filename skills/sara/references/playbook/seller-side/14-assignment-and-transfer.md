# Assignment and Transfer -- Seller Playbook

This section governs the buyer's ability to assign or transfer its rights and obligations under the PSA before closing, the seller's corresponding rights, and the structural constraints that protect the seller's deal certainty and post-closing recourse. In institutional commercial real estate dispositions ($50M+), the assignment clause is the seller's primary tool for maintaining control over who the counterparty is at closing, ensuring the buyer's deposit remains at risk, preserving post-closing indemnification recourse, and preventing the buyer from flipping the contract or introducing unknown parties into the transaction. A permissive assignment clause undermines the seller's bargained-for protections throughout the entire PSA.

## Buyer's Right to Assign the PSA

### Preferred Position

Impose the tightest possible restrictions on buyer's right to assign:

- Buyer shall not, directly or indirectly, assign this Agreement or any of its rights hereunder without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be granted or withheld in Seller's sole and absolute discretion.
- Any attempted assignment in violation of this restriction shall, at Seller's election, be of no force or effect and shall constitute a default by Buyer under this Agreement.
- Narrow carve-out for Affiliate assignments only, subject to strict conditions (see Conditions on Permitted Assignments below).

The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3) provides the gold-standard seller formulation: sole discretion as the default, with a narrow carve-out requiring (a) 51% direct or indirect ownership and control by the original Purchaser or its owners as of the Effective Date, (b) written assumption of all obligations and joint and several liability, (c) ERISA and AML compliance, (d) no purchase price mark-up, (e) the study period has ended, and (f) 5 days' advance notice with supporting documentation. This comprehensive set of conditions should be the starting point for every seller-side negotiation.

The Meadows form (Section 9.11) takes an even harder line: "Buyer shall not assign or transfer this Agreement, or any interest in or part of this Agreement, without the prior consent of Seller, which Seller may withhold." No carve-outs at all. While this is the strongest possible position, sophisticated institutional buyers will resist a complete prohibition.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 16.6) permits assignment to Affiliates without consent after the due diligence period, but the Affiliate definition (Section 16.4) is a standard control-based definition without the UNICO Buyer Side form's low-threshold qualifier. This is the seller-favorable version of the UNICO standard.
- Resist any buyer request for consent-free assignment to non-Affiliates, including TIC co-investors, 1031 exchange entities, or unrelated third parties. The buyer chose to sign the PSA -- the seller is entitled to close with the entity it underwrote.
- Resist any buyer request for a "reasonableness" standard on consent. Sole discretion is the seller's standard and is universally enforceable in commercial contracts between sophisticated parties.
- Resist any "deemed consent" provisions (where failure to respond to an assignment request within a specified period constitutes consent). These create traps for the seller and shift the burden of action from the assigning party to the non-assigning party.
- Condition the Affiliate carve-out on the expiration of the due diligence period. This prevents the buyer from executing the PSA solely to tie up the property and then assigning to a different buyer during due diligence -- effectively using the PSA as an option.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Consent-free assignment to Affiliates, SPEs, 1031 exchange entities, and TIC co-investors. Reasonableness standard for non-Affiliate assignments. Broad Affiliate definition.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If buyer insists on some consent-free assignment right, concede Affiliate assignments only, subject to all conditions in the Detailed Seller PSA formulation (51% ownership, assumption, joint and several liability, ERISA/AML compliance, no mark-up, post-due-diligence, 5 days' notice).
2. If buyer pushes to lower the ownership threshold below 51%, concede to 25% but add a requirement that the same individual(s) who control Buyer as of the Effective Date must control the assignee (a "Key Person" test), and require the assignee to deliver organizational documents demonstrating compliance.
3. If buyer insists on TIC or 1031 carve-outs, accept a limited carve-out conditioned on (a) an Affiliate of Buyer serving as managing co-tenant or property manager, (b) the number of co-tenants not exceeding [5-7] without seller consent, and (c) buyer coordinating all additional closing documentation at buyer's sole cost.
4. If buyer demands a reasonableness standard for non-Affiliate assignments, concede only if (a) seller has 15 business days to review the assignment request and assignee credentials, (b) seller may consider the financial capacity, reputation, experience, and litigation history of the proposed assignee, and (c) seller's determination of reasonableness is conclusive absent fraud or bad faith.

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical risk if assignment is unrestricted**: The buyer can flip the contract for a profit, introducing an unknown counterparty with unknown creditworthiness. The seller loses control over who holds its deposit, who makes closing representations, and who bears post-closing obligations.
- **High risk if the Affiliate definition is too broad**: A broad Affiliate definition (e.g., any entity managed by the same platform, regardless of ownership) converts the "Affiliate only" carve-out into an open assignment right. The seller's protections become illusory.
- **Moderate risk if TIC assignments are unrestricted**: Multiple TIC co-tenants increase closing complexity, multiply the number of entities the seller must chase for post-closing claims, and may delay closing.
- **Low risk with the Detailed Seller PSA standard**: The 51% ownership, joint-and-several-liability, and post-due-diligence conditions provide robust protection while accommodating legitimate institutional structuring.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office**: Standard restrictions are appropriate. Institutional office buyers typically close through a single SPE.
- **Industrial/logistics**: In portfolio transactions, buyer may request the right to assign individual properties to separate SPEs. If accepted, require each SPE to independently satisfy all assignment conditions and require a creditworthy parent guaranty for each.
- **Multifamily**: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac borrower requirements may force the buyer into a specific entity structure. If the buyer raises this, require documentary evidence from the lender and condition the accommodation on the assignee meeting all PSA conditions.
- **Retail**: In ground-lease transactions, the ground lessor's consent to assignment may provide an additional layer of protection for the seller. Coordinate the PSA assignment clause with the ground lease assignment provisions.
- **Data centers**: The buyer may be a data center operator seeking to assign to a REIT or infrastructure fund. Require that any assignee have demonstrated experience operating data center assets.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions**: Sole-discretion consent provisions are universally enforceable in commercial contracts between sophisticated parties. No U.S. jurisdiction implies a reasonableness standard in arm's-length commercial real estate transactions (unlike residential landlord-tenant contexts in some states).
- **New York**: New York courts enforce anti-assignment provisions as written. See, e.g., Pravin Banker Assocs., Ltd. v. Banco Popular del Peru, 109 F.3d 850 (2d Cir. 1997) (enforcing contractual prohibition on assignment).
- **California**: California courts generally enforce anti-assignment provisions in commercial contracts, though California Civil Code Section 1671 may affect liquidated damages consequences of a prohibited assignment (see Prohibited Assignment Consequences below).
- **Delaware**: Delaware courts strictly enforce anti-assignment provisions in LLC and LP agreements and in commercial contracts.

## Definition of "Affiliate" for Assignment Purposes

### Preferred Position

Define "Affiliate" as narrowly as possible to limit the scope of consent-free assignments:

- "Affiliate" means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Buyer. "Control" means (a) the ownership, directly or indirectly, of at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the beneficial interest in the controlled entity, AND (b) the right to direct the management and policies of the controlled entity.
- The definition should require BOTH an ownership threshold (51%) and management control. The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 16.4) uses only a control test without an ownership threshold -- this is too permissive for the seller.
- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3(a)) requires the assignee to be "controlled by Purchaser or the owners of Purchaser as of the Effective Date" with "at least a fifty-one percent (51%) interest." This dual requirement (control + ownership, measured as of the Effective Date) is the ideal seller formulation.
- Resist buyer's attempts to include management platforms, fund advisors, or sub-advisors in the Affiliate definition. The Affiliate test should be entity-specific, not platform-specific.
- Resist the UNICO Buyer Side form's low-threshold qualifier that deems an entity an Affiliate if the buyer's management company holds as little as 2.5% of total interests. This converts the Affiliate carve-out into a near-universal assignment right.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The "as of the Effective Date" qualifier in the Detailed Seller PSA is critical: it prevents the buyer from restructuring its ownership post-signing to expand the universe of Affiliates. The seller underwrote a specific counterparty, and the Affiliate definition should be anchored to that counterparty.
- Require that the assignee deliver organizational documents (certificate of formation, operating agreement, or partnership agreement) demonstrating compliance with the Affiliate definition. The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3(f)) requires "evidence that the foregoing conditions are satisfied" -- this should include organizational documents.
- If the buyer requests that fund vehicles or co-investment vehicles be included in the Affiliate definition, resist this on the basis that fund investors are unknown to the seller and the seller cannot evaluate the creditworthiness or character of the ultimate beneficial owners.
- The ownership threshold should be measured by "beneficial interest" (economic ownership), not "voting interest" or "governance rights." This prevents structuring around the threshold through non-economic governance interests.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Control-based definition without an ownership threshold, or with a low threshold (10-25%). Include fund vehicles, management platforms, and co-investment entities.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If buyer resists the 51% ownership threshold, concede to 35% but require that the same individual(s) named in the PSA (or an exhibit thereto) retain day-to-day management authority over the assignee.
2. If buyer insists on including fund vehicles, accept this only for funds where (a) the named buyer or its principals serve as general partner or investment manager, AND (b) the fund has net assets of at least $[amount] (e.g., $100M).
3. If buyer insists on a platform-based definition, accept this but require seller to approve the specific management platform entity by name in the PSA (i.e., the definition references "[Buyer Management Co.]" by name rather than a generic platform definition).
4. As a final fallback, accept a broader Affiliate definition but add compensating protections: require a guaranty from the buyer's parent or principal for all PSA obligations, so the seller's recourse is not diminished by the assignment.

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical risk if the Affiliate definition is purely control-based without an ownership threshold**: The buyer's management company may control dozens of entities with no meaningful economic connection to the buyer. Assignment to any of these entities would be consent-free, defeating the purpose of the restriction.
- **High risk if fund vehicles are included without financial covenants**: A co-investment vehicle or sidecar fund may be thinly capitalized with no independent creditworthiness.
- **Moderate risk with the 51% ownership + control formulation**: This captures only entities with a genuine economic and governance connection to the buyer. It is the strongest defensible position.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types**: The Affiliate definition is asset-type agnostic. The seller's concern is counterparty risk, which is a function of the buyer's organizational structure, not the property type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Delaware**: Delaware LLC agreements commonly define "affiliate" using a control-based test. If the buyer's operating agreement uses a broader definition, the seller should insist that the PSA definition controls, not the operating agreement definition.
- **All jurisdictions**: The Affiliate definition is a contractual construct. No jurisdiction imposes a statutory definition of "affiliate" on commercial real estate PSAs. The seller has full freedom to negotiate the definition.

## Seller Consent Requirements for Assignment

### Preferred Position

Maintain sole and absolute discretion over all non-Affiliate assignments:

- Seller's consent may be granted or withheld in Seller's sole and absolute discretion, for any reason or no reason.
- No deemed-consent provisions. Silence is not consent.
- No requirement that seller respond within any specified time period. (However, as a practical matter, seller should respond promptly to avoid claims of bad faith.)
- Seller may condition consent on any requirements seller deems appropriate, including (a) additional earnest money, (b) a guaranty from the assignee's parent or principal, (c) evidence of the assignee's financial capacity, (d) the assignee's assumption of all buyer obligations, (e) the assignee's organizational documents, and (f) payment of seller's legal fees for reviewing the assignment.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Buyer will push for a reasonableness standard. Resist this. In the institutional market, sole discretion is the accepted standard for non-Affiliate assignments. The buyer's remedy is to negotiate a broader Affiliate definition, not to weaken the consent standard.
- Buyer may argue that sole discretion is "unconscionable" or violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In arm's-length commercial transactions between sophisticated parties, this argument fails in virtually every U.S. jurisdiction. The implied covenant does not override express contractual terms granting sole discretion.
- If seller concedes any ground on the consent standard, the minimum fallback is "not to be unreasonably withheld" with an express list of factors seller may consider in determining reasonableness, including: (a) assignee's net worth (not less than Buyer's net worth as of the Effective Date), (b) assignee's real estate experience, (c) assignee's litigation and regulatory history, (d) assignee's ability to close on the scheduled date, and (e) seller's reasonable business judgment regarding the character and reputation of the assignee.
- Require the buyer to pay seller's reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including attorney fees) incurred in reviewing any assignment request, regardless of whether consent is granted.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Reasonableness standard with deemed consent if seller fails to respond within 5 business days.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If buyer insists on a response deadline, concede a 10-business-day response period, but provide that seller's failure to respond is deemed a denial (not consent).
2. If buyer insists on a reasonableness standard, accept "not unreasonably withheld" but add the enumerated factors above and provide that seller's determination "shall be conclusive absent fraud or manifest bad faith."
3. If buyer insists on deemed consent, concede deemed consent only after 15 business days AND only if buyer has delivered all required documentation (organizational docs, financial statements, ERISA/AML certifications) AND buyer sends a second notice expressly stating "IF SELLER DOES NOT RESPOND WITHIN [5] BUSINESS DAYS, CONSENT SHALL BE DEEMED GRANTED."
4. As a final fallback, if seller must concede a reasonableness standard with deemed consent, add a right to revoke deemed consent within 5 business days if seller identifies a legitimate objection, and require the buyer to indemnify seller for any costs or liabilities arising from the assignment.

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk with sole discretion**: Seller has complete control over counterparty identity.
- **Moderate risk with reasonableness standard**: Disputes over reasonableness may arise, but the enumerated-factors approach limits buyer's ability to challenge seller's decision.
- **High risk with deemed consent**: Seller may lose control over counterparty identity through administrative oversight (failure to respond to a notice buried in a stack of correspondence).

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types**: Consent standards are generally asset-type agnostic. The seller's concern is counterparty control, which is universal.
- **Data centers**: In data center dispositions, the seller-operator may have legitimate competitive concerns about the identity of the assignee. Sole discretion is particularly important to prevent assignment to a competitor.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions**: Sole-discretion consent provisions are enforceable in commercial real estate contracts in every U.S. jurisdiction. The implied covenant of good faith does not override express sole-discretion language.
- **California**: While California courts recognize the implied covenant of good faith, they have consistently held that express sole-discretion provisions in commercial contracts are enforceable. See Carma Developers, Inc. v. Marathon Dev. Cal., Inc., 2 Cal. 4th 342 (1992).
- **New York**: New York does not imply a duty of good faith to override express contractual terms granting sole discretion. See 511 West 232nd Owners Corp. v. Jennifer Realty Co., 98 N.Y.2d 144 (2002).

## Conditions on Permitted Assignments (Original Buyer Liability and Assignee Assumption)

### Preferred Position

Impose the most stringent conditions possible on every permitted assignment:

1. **Written assumption**: The assignee must execute a written assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, assuming all of Buyer's obligations under this Agreement, jointly and severally with Buyer.
2. **Joint and several liability**: The original Buyer shall remain jointly and severally liable with the assignee for all obligations under this Agreement, including post-closing indemnification, representation and warranty survival claims, proration true-ups, and any liability for deposit forfeiture. No assignment shall release Buyer from any obligation. This is the universal market standard -- every reviewed precedent requires ongoing original buyer liability (UNICO Buyer Side Section 16.6; UNICO Seller Side Section 16.6; Detailed Seller PSA Section 11.3(b); Meadows Section 9.11).
3. **ERISA and AML compliance**: The assignee must be able to truthfully make the ERISA representations (not an employee benefit plan, not using plan assets) and anti-money-laundering/anti-terrorism representations set forth in the PSA. The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3(c)) includes this requirement -- it is non-negotiable for institutional sellers.
4. **No purchase price mark-up**: There shall be no mark-up or increase in the purchase price in connection with any assignment. The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3(d)) includes this protection. This prevents the buyer from flipping the contract at a profit without the seller's knowledge.
5. **Post-due-diligence only**: No assignment shall be effective until after the expiration of the study/due diligence period. The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3(e)) includes this requirement.
6. **Advance notice with documentation**: At least 5 business days before the proposed assignment, Buyer shall provide Seller with (a) the full legal name and signature block of the assignee, (b) the organizational documents of the assignee, (c) evidence of compliance with the Affiliate definition, and (d) the executed assumption agreement. The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3(f)) requires notice and "evidence that the foregoing conditions are satisfied."
7. **Seller's legal fees**: Buyer shall reimburse Seller for reasonable legal fees incurred in reviewing the assignment and related documentation.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Joint and several liability is the most important protection. If buyer resists, frame it this way: the seller agreed to sell to this specific buyer based on the buyer's financial capacity, reputation, and track record. If the buyer assigns to a different entity, the seller should not bear the risk that the assignee is less creditworthy. Joint and several liability ensures the seller's recourse is not diminished.
- The no-mark-up requirement prevents contract flipping. Institutional sellers should also consider adding an express anti-assignment-for-profit provision: "Buyer shall not receive, directly or indirectly, any profit, premium, or other compensation in connection with any assignment of this Agreement."
- The ERISA requirement is critical for institutional sellers that are themselves ERISA-regulated or that have ERISA-regulated investors. A "prohibited transaction" under ERISA Section 406 could impose excise taxes and rescission liability.
- Resist any buyer request for a release upon closing. The seller needs post-closing recourse against both the original buyer and the assignee. If the original buyer dissolves or distributes its assets after closing, the seller needs the assignee as an additional source of recovery.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Assignee assumes all obligations; original buyer seeks release at closing or a sunset on liability. Buyer resists post-due-diligence requirement and legal-fee reimbursement.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If buyer demands a release at closing, concede only a partial release: original buyer remains liable for (a) pre-closing defaults, (b) deposit forfeiture claims, (c) any representation or warranty claim noticed within the survival period, and (d) any indemnification obligation arising from pre-closing acts or omissions. Original buyer is released only from purely post-closing operating obligations of the assignee.
2. If buyer demands a sunset on liability, concede a sunset that expires on the later of (a) the expiration of the representation and warranty survival period, (b) 24 months after closing, or (c) the final resolution of any claim noticed within the survival period.
3. If buyer resists the post-due-diligence requirement, concede pre-due-diligence Affiliate assignments but require that any pre-due-diligence assignee also satisfy all conditions (assumption, joint liability, ERISA, AML, notice).
4. If buyer resists legal-fee reimbursement, concede this point but cap the buyer's notice obligations at a level that minimizes seller's review costs (e.g., a standardized assumption form attached to the PSA as an exhibit).

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical risk if original buyer is released upon assignment**: The seller's post-closing recourse depends entirely on the creditworthiness of an entity the seller did not select and may not have evaluated.
- **High risk if ERISA/AML representations are not required of the assignee**: A prohibited transaction or anti-money-laundering violation could expose the seller to regulatory liability.
- **Moderate risk if assignment occurs pre-due-diligence**: The buyer may assign the PSA to a straw entity during due diligence and then terminate, leaving the seller with a deposit claim against an empty shell.
- **Low risk with the full Detailed Seller PSA condition set**: Comprehensive conditions preserve the seller's protections.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily**: If the buyer is assuming a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loan, the lender will independently evaluate the assignee. This provides an additional layer of protection, but the seller should not rely on it -- lender approval and seller approval are independent requirements.
- **Industrial/logistics**: In portfolio dispositions, each assignee SPE should independently satisfy all conditions. Do not accept a blanket assumption by a parent entity unless that parent also provides a guaranty.
- **Office**: In build-to-suit or development transactions, ensure the assignee has the development experience and financial capacity to complete the project. Add a specific condition requiring evidence of the assignee's development track record.
- **Data centers**: Operational expertise is critical. Add a condition that the assignee (or its property manager) has experience operating data center assets of comparable size and classification.
- **Retail**: In multi-tenant retail, the buyer's property management track record is relevant to the ongoing value of the tenant relationships the seller has built. Add a condition regarding the assignee's retail property management experience.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions**: Joint and several liability provisions are universally enforceable. The seller should ensure the assumption agreement is governed by the same law as the PSA.
- **Delaware**: Delaware LLC members are generally not liable for the LLC's obligations absent a guaranty or veil-piercing. Joint and several liability must therefore be imposed contractually on the entity level, not the member level.
- **New York**: New York courts enforce no-release-upon-assignment provisions strictly. The seller should not rely on common law principles but should include express contractual language.

---

## Seller's Right to Assign

### Preferred Position

Preserve seller's maximum flexibility to assign:

- Seller may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any Affiliate of Seller without Buyer's prior consent, provided the assignee assumes all of Seller's obligations hereunder.
- In the alternative, silence on seller's assignment right is acceptable -- under the common law of most jurisdictions, contract rights are assignable unless the contract provides otherwise. If the seller drafts the PSA and omits any restriction on seller assignment, the seller retains the right to assign.
- None of the reviewed precedent forms contain restrictions on seller assignment. This silence benefits the seller.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Buyer will push for restrictions on seller assignment, arguing that the buyer underwrote the seller's creditworthiness for post-closing obligations. This is a legitimate concern, but the seller should resist on the basis that (a) the seller's post-closing obligations are typically limited and capped, (b) the seller's representations and warranties are subject to short survival periods and monetary caps, and (c) the seller needs flexibility to restructure its entity post-signing (e.g., to accommodate a Section 1031 exchange, a partnership dissolution, or a fund wind-down).
- If buyer insists on restricting seller assignment, concede a notice requirement (seller gives buyer 5 business days' notice of any assignment) but resist any consent requirement.
- If buyer insists on consent, resist sole discretion and negotiate for a "not to be unreasonably withheld" standard, with seller's obligation to ensure the assignee has sufficient assets to honor post-closing obligations.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Seller shall not assign without buyer's prior written consent. No carve-out for Affiliates.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If buyer insists on a consent requirement, concede "not to be unreasonably withheld" consent for non-Affiliate assignments, with consent-free Affiliate assignments.
2. If buyer insists on consent even for Affiliates, concede notice-only for Affiliates (no consent), with "not to be unreasonably withheld" consent for non-Affiliates.
3. If buyer insists on sole discretion over all seller assignments, concede this but carve out (a) assignments required by court order, (b) assignments to a successor entity in a merger or reorganization, and (c) assignments in connection with seller's 1031 exchange.
4. As a final fallback, accept buyer's consent requirement but ensure the PSA permits seller to designate the grantor on the deed (as a closing mechanic rather than an assignment) without triggering the consent requirement.

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk if seller retains unrestricted assignment right**: Seller has maximum flexibility.
- **Moderate risk with notice requirement only**: Buyer is informed but cannot block the assignment. This is a reasonable middle ground.
- **High risk if buyer has sole discretion over seller assignment**: Seller may be unable to close if its entity structure changes post-signing (e.g., due to a fund dissolution or regulatory requirement).

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types**: Seller assignment flexibility is a function of the seller's organizational structure, not the asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions**: Under the common law, contract rights are generally assignable unless the contract provides otherwise. Seller benefits from the common law default.

---

## 1031 Exchange Cooperation

### Preferred Position

Include mutual 1031 cooperation language, but ensure the seller's exchange does not impose burdens on the buyer:

- Either party may structure the transaction as part of a like-kind exchange under IRC Section 1031. The other party shall cooperate, including executing such documents as may be reasonably necessary.
- The cooperating party shall not incur any additional cost, expense, or liability, and the closing date shall not be extended or accelerated.
- The seller's 1031 exchange structure shall not affect the buyer's rights under the PSA, including the buyer's right to receive a deed and title insurance.
- If seller is the exchanging party, seller may direct the deed from a qualified intermediary or exchange accommodation titleholder, but the deed must be in recordable form and must satisfy the title company's requirements.

This is the universal market standard. The UNICO forms (Buyer Side Section 16.7; Seller Side Section 16.7) and the Seller Income Property form (Section 20) all use substantially identical language.

### Key Negotiation Points

- From the seller's perspective, the 1031 cooperation clause should be mutual -- the seller may also need to structure the disposition as a 1031 exchange (or the seller's upstream investors may require it).
- Ensure the clause does not permit the buyer to extend the closing date for 1031 purposes. Every precedent form includes this protection, and it is non-negotiable.
- Ensure the cooperating party's indemnification is mutual: each party indemnifies the other for any costs or liabilities arising from the exchanging party's 1031 structure.
- If the seller is the exchanging party, ensure the PSA permits the seller to assign the Agreement (or the right to receive the purchase price) to a qualified intermediary without triggering any buyer consent requirement.
- Consider adding an express acknowledgment that the cooperating party is not a party to the exchange, does not take title to any exchange property, and has no liability to the exchanging party if the exchange fails to qualify under Section 1031.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Cooperation is acceptable, but buyer may push for the right to extend closing for its own 1031 exchange (if buyer is the exchanging party).

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If buyer requests a closing extension for 1031 purposes, deny this but offer a compromise: buyer may delay its QI's release of funds by up to 3 business days after closing without affecting the closing date itself.
2. If buyer insists on a closing extension, cap the extension at 5 business days, with a per-diem extension fee of $[amount] per day (calculated as the daily interest rate on the purchase price).
3. If buyer requests that seller take "additional actions" beyond document execution, limit cooperation to "executing such documents as are customary in 1031 exchanges and as do not impose any additional cost or liability on Seller."
4. Do not concede any provision that requires seller to take title to replacement property, guarantee the exchanging party's obligations, or advance funds.

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk with standard mutual cooperation**: The seller's obligations are limited to document execution and cooperation. No financial exposure.
- **Moderate risk if closing is extended for 1031 purposes**: Each day of delay exposes the seller to market risk, interest cost on bridge financing, and the risk of a material adverse change.
- **Negligible risk if cooperating party is fully indemnified**: The indemnification protects against any costs arising from the exchange structure.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types**: 1031 cooperation is universal and asset-type agnostic.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Federal (IRC)**: Section 1031 permits like-kind exchanges of real property only (personal property was excluded by the 2017 TCJA). Ensure the PSA's purchase price allocation is consistent with the exchanging party's 1031 planning.
- **All states**: State income tax conformity to Section 1031 varies. The PSA cooperation clause should not be affected by state non-conformity, but the exchanging party bears the risk of state tax consequences.

## TIC/DST Structure Accommodations

### Preferred Position

Resist TIC and DST accommodations unless the buyer provides significant compensating protections:

- The default position is that buyer may not assign to multiple TIC co-tenants or a DST without seller's prior written consent, which may be withheld in seller's sole and absolute discretion.
- If consent is granted, impose strict conditions: (a) total number of TIC co-tenants shall not exceed [5] without seller's consent, (b) each TIC co-tenant must independently satisfy all assignment conditions (assumption, joint and several liability, ERISA, AML), (c) an Affiliate of buyer must serve as managing co-tenant with authority to make all decisions regarding post-closing obligations under the PSA, (d) buyer bears all incremental closing costs, including seller's legal fees for reviewing multiple document sets, and (e) the TIC/DST structure shall not delay closing.
- For DST structures, require that the signatory trustee (an Affiliate of buyer's sponsor) independently guarantee all post-closing buyer obligations under the PSA.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The seller's primary concern with TIC structures is post-closing enforcement: if there are 35 TIC co-tenants and the seller has a representation and warranty claim, the seller must pursue 35 individual entities across potentially 35 jurisdictions. Require joint and several liability among all co-tenants and designate the managing co-tenant as the agent for service of process and notices.
- The seller's primary concern with DST structures is the passivity requirement: DST trustees cannot negotiate new leases, make non-routine capital expenditures, or restructure debt. This limits the DST's ability to fulfill certain post-closing obligations (e.g., cooperation with proration true-ups, delivery of tenant estoppels). Require the sponsor entity to guaranty all such obligations independently of the DST.
- Closing complexity is a legitimate concern. Multiple document sets (separate deeds, assignments, closing statements for each TIC) multiply the risk of error and delay. Require buyer to deliver all TIC/DST closing documents in final form at least 3 business days before closing.
- The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 16.6) permits TIC structures with an Affiliate property manager requirement. If this language is accepted, ensure the property management agreement is subject to seller's review and that the property manager has independent liability for post-closing PSA obligations.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: TIC/DST is a standard institutional structure; seller should accommodate it without additional conditions or costs.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If buyer insists on TIC/DST accommodation, accept it but cap the number of TIC co-tenants at 7 and require each co-tenant to execute a joint-and-several-liability agreement with the managing co-tenant.
2. If buyer resists the cap on co-tenants, accept up to 15 co-tenants but require a creditworthy parent guaranty (net worth of at least $[10M]) for all post-closing obligations.
3. If buyer resists a parent guaranty, require the buyer to maintain a post-closing escrow (funded from the purchase price) in the amount of the seller's potential post-closing exposure (e.g., the rep and warranty liability cap) for the duration of the survival period.
4. As a final fallback, accept the TIC/DST structure without additional conditions but negotiate for an accelerated survival period (e.g., 3 months instead of 6 months) to limit the seller's exposure to the fragmented counterparty structure.

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk if TIC co-tenants are not jointly and severally liable**: The seller's post-closing claim is fragmented across multiple entities, some of which may be thinly capitalized.
- **High risk if DST trustee is the sole counterparty for post-closing obligations**: The DST's passivity limitations may prevent the trustee from cooperating with post-closing obligations.
- **Moderate risk if closing is complex**: Document errors in multi-TIC closings can create title defects and delay recording.
- **Low risk with full conditions (joint liability, guaranty, managing co-tenant, document delivery deadline)**: Seller's protections are preserved despite the structural complexity.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily**: DST accommodations are most frequently requested for stabilized multifamily assets. Seller should be prepared for this request and have pre-drafted conditions.
- **Industrial/logistics (NNN)**: Single-tenant NNN industrial properties are prime DST candidates. The simplicity of the lease structure mitigates some of the seller's concerns about post-closing enforcement.
- **Office**: TIC/DST requests are less common for office but may arise for stabilized, credit-tenant-leased office. Apply standard conditions.
- **Retail (NNN single-tenant)**: Similar to NNN industrial -- a common DST asset class. Standard conditions apply.
- **Data centers**: TIC/DST is uncommon. Resist accommodation absent extraordinary circumstances.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Delaware**: DSTs are formed under 12 Del. C. Section 3801 et seq. The trust agreement limits the trustee's authority. Seller should review the trust agreement to confirm the trustee has authority to fulfill post-closing PSA obligations; if not, require a sponsor guaranty.
- **Federal (SEC)**: DST interests are securities. The seller has no obligation under the PSA to facilitate the buyer's securities offering, and the cooperation clause should expressly disclaim any such obligation.
- **All jurisdictions**: Joint and several liability among TIC co-tenants must be established by contract (the default rule for tenants in common is several, not joint, liability). Ensure the assumption agreement expressly imposes joint and several liability.

## Restrictions on Change of Control of Buyer Entity

### Preferred Position

Include an express provision restricting changes in the direct or indirect ownership or control of the Buyer entity:

- Any transfer, directly or indirectly, of a controlling interest in Buyer (or in any entity that directly or indirectly controls Buyer) shall be deemed an assignment of this Agreement and shall require Seller's prior written consent under Section [Assignment].
- "Controlling interest" means (a) more than 49% of the direct or indirect ownership interests in Buyer, or (b) the right to direct the management and policies of Buyer (e.g., a change in the managing member or general partner).
- Transfers among existing owners as of the Effective Date, and transfers to Affiliates of existing owners, are excluded from this restriction.
- Any change of control in violation of this provision shall constitute a default by Buyer.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3(a)) implicitly addresses change of control by anchoring the Affiliate definition to "the owners of Purchaser as of the Effective Date." A change in ownership would alter who qualifies as an Affiliate, thereby restricting the buyer's assignment rights. Make this implication explicit.
- The Meadows form's broad prohibition on assignment of "any interest in or part of this Agreement" arguably covers indirect transfers. Rather than relying on this ambiguity, include express change-of-control language.
- Change-of-control provisions protect the seller against the buyer signing the PSA and then selling a controlling interest to an unknown third party -- effectively an end-run around the assignment restrictions.
- If buyer resists, frame the argument in terms of the seller's title insurance: the title company underwrote the buyer (or its principals) for the owner's policy. A change in control may affect the title company's willingness to issue the policy or require a new underwriting review.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Changes in indirect ownership should not be restricted. The PSA is between the entities, not the individuals.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If buyer resists a full change-of-control provision, limit the restriction to changes in the "managing member," "general partner," or "investment manager" of Buyer (i.e., governance control rather than economic ownership).
2. If buyer resists any change-of-control restriction, negotiate for a "Key Person" provision: if [named individual] ceases to be actively involved in managing Buyer's obligations under this Agreement, Seller may terminate the Agreement.
3. If buyer resists the Key Person provision, negotiate for a notification requirement: Buyer shall notify Seller within 5 business days of any change in the direct ownership of Buyer. This gives the seller information without consent rights.
4. As a final fallback, accept silence on change of control but tighten the Affiliate definition to be anchored to specific individuals and ownership percentages as of the Effective Date, creating a de facto change-of-control protection for the Affiliate assignment carve-out.

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk without any change-of-control protection**: The buyer can effectively sell the deal by transferring its ownership interests, circumventing the assignment restrictions.
- **Moderate risk with a governance-only restriction**: Changes in economic ownership without a change in governance are less likely to affect the seller's position, but the seller loses visibility into the buyer's financial backing.
- **Low risk with a comprehensive change-of-control provision**: The seller maintains full control over counterparty identity.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types**: Change-of-control risk is buyer-structural, not asset-specific. However, in sale-leaseback transactions (industrial, office), a change in control of the buyer-landlord may affect the seller-tenant's comfort level. Coordinate the PSA change-of-control provision with any change-of-control provisions in the lease.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **New York**: New York courts have held that anti-assignment clauses do not automatically apply to changes of control of the contracting entity unless the clause expressly covers such changes. See Brause v. Goldman, 10 A.D.2d 328 (1st Dep't 1960). Express language is essential.
- **Delaware**: Delaware courts distinguish between transfers of LLC membership interests (which may or may not constitute an assignment of the LLC's contracts) and transfers of governance rights. The PSA must expressly address both to close the loophole.
- **California**: California courts generally follow the same approach -- anti-assignment clauses apply to direct assignments, not to changes of control, unless the clause expressly covers changes of control.

## Delaware Statutory Trust Considerations

### Preferred Position

From the seller's perspective, DST-specific protections are necessary to address the unique risks of DST counterparties:

- If Buyer assigns this Agreement to a DST, the signatory trustee of the DST and [Buyer Sponsor Entity] shall jointly and severally guarantee all of Buyer's post-closing obligations under this Agreement, including indemnification obligations, proration true-up obligations, and any other obligation that survives Closing.
- The DST trust agreement shall not limit the signatory trustee's authority to perform any obligation under this Agreement without requiring the consent of the DST beneficial owners or any third party.
- The DST shall maintain at minimum $[amount] in reserve funds for a period of not less than [24] months following Closing to satisfy potential post-closing claims by Seller.
- Seller shall have no obligation to provide information, execute documents, or otherwise cooperate with the DST's securities offering (Regulation D or otherwise), and Seller shall not be named in any offering memorandum or private placement document without Seller's prior written consent.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The critical issue with DST counterparties is the passivity requirement: under Revenue Ruling 2004-86 and Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4, the DST trustee cannot take actions beyond those permitted in the trust agreement without risking the DST's tax-advantaged status. This means the trustee may be unable to cooperate with post-closing obligations that require active decision-making (e.g., negotiating proration disputes, responding to indemnification claims, cooperating with audits).
- Require the buyer's sponsor to provide a separate guaranty at closing. The guaranty should cover all post-closing PSA obligations and should not be subject to the DST trust agreement's limitations.
- Require the buyer to deliver a copy of the DST trust agreement to seller for review. Seller should confirm that the trust agreement grants the signatory trustee sufficient authority to comply with the PSA's post-closing obligations.
- Ensure the master-lease structure (if used) does not create a subordination issue: if the DST enters into a master lease at closing, the master tenant's sublease to the operating tenants must be subject to and subordinate to the direct leases that the seller is assigning at closing. The seller does not want to be drawn into a dispute between the master tenant and the subtenants over lease priority.
- Seller should not agree to any representations regarding the property that would be included in the DST's private placement memorandum. Include an express disclaimer: "Seller makes no representation or warranty to any DST beneficial owner or prospective beneficial owner."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: DST is a standard 1031 replacement property structure; seller should not impose additional conditions beyond those applicable to any other assignee.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If buyer resists a sponsor guaranty, require the signatory trustee to maintain a post-closing reserve funded from the purchase price proceeds, held in escrow for the duration of the survival period.
2. If buyer resists a reserve, require the DST trust agreement to expressly authorize the signatory trustee to resolve post-closing claims and cooperate with the seller on proration true-ups and indemnification matters, without requiring approval of beneficial owners.
3. If buyer resists providing the trust agreement, require the buyer's counsel to deliver an opinion letter confirming that the signatory trustee has authority to perform all post-closing obligations under the PSA.
4. As a final fallback, accept the DST assignment without additional conditions but negotiate for an accelerated and shortened survival period (e.g., 3 months) and a monetary cap on post-closing claims (e.g., 1% of the purchase price) to limit the seller's need for post-closing recourse.

### Risk Assessment

- **Critical risk if no sponsor guaranty or reserve**: The seller's post-closing recourse is limited to a passive trust entity that may lack the authority, liquidity, or willingness to respond to claims.
- **High risk if the trust agreement limits trustee authority**: The trustee may be unable to cooperate with legitimate post-closing claims without jeopardizing the DST's tax status.
- **Moderate risk if the master-lease structure creates lease priority issues**: Confusion over lease subordination can affect tenant relationships and property value post-closing.
- **Low risk with comprehensive protections (guaranty, reserve, trust agreement review)**: The seller's position is adequately protected despite the DST structure.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Multifamily**: DSTs are extremely common for stabilized multifamily. Sellers should have standardized DST conditions pre-drafted.
- **Industrial/logistics (NNN)**: Long-term, single-tenant NNN leases are ideal for DST structures due to limited management requirements. Seller's post-closing exposure is lower, so conditions may be relaxed.
- **Office**: DSTs are less common. Apply standard conditions if requested.
- **Retail (NNN)**: Similar to NNN industrial. Standard conditions apply.
- **Data centers**: DSTs are rare for data centers. If requested, impose heightened conditions due to operational complexity.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Delaware**: 12 Del. C. Section 3801 et seq. governs DST formation and operation. The statute is permissive regarding trust agreement terms, so the trust agreement (not the statute) controls the trustee's authority.
- **Federal (IRS)**: Revenue Ruling 2004-86 sets forth the conditions for DST treatment as real property for 1031 purposes. Violations of these conditions (e.g., the trustee exceeding its authority) can cause all DST interests to be recharacterized as securities rather than real property, with adverse tax consequences to the DST investors. This is the buyer's risk, not the seller's, but seller should be aware of it in case it affects the buyer's willingness to cooperate post-closing.

## Prohibited Assignment Consequences

### Preferred Position

Impose the most severe consequences for any prohibited assignment:

- Any attempted assignment in violation of Section [Assignment] shall, at Seller's election, be of no force or effect.
- Any such attempted assignment shall constitute a default by Buyer under this Agreement, entitling Seller to exercise all remedies available under Section [Default], including retention of the Deposit as liquidated damages.
- Seller's election to void the assignment shall not waive Seller's right to pursue default remedies. These rights are cumulative, not alternative.
- If Buyer makes a prohibited assignment, Seller may also, at Seller's option, terminate this Agreement and retain the Deposit.

The Detailed Seller PSA (Section 11.3) provides the model language: "Any attempted assignment in violation hereof shall, at the election of Seller, be of no force or effect and shall constitute a default by Purchaser."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The critical element is that the assignment is "voidable at Seller's election" (not automatically void). This gives the seller the option to ratify the assignment if the assignee is acceptable, or to void it and pursue default remedies if the assignee is not.
- Resist any buyer request for a cure period before a prohibited assignment constitutes a default. The buyer had clear notice of the restriction and chose to violate it. A cure period rewards non-compliance.
- Resist any buyer request to decouple the voiding of the assignment from the default consequences. From the seller's perspective, a prohibited assignment is a serious breach that undermines the seller's bargained-for protections. It should trigger the full range of default remedies.
- Ensure the prohibited-assignment-as-default provision is cross-referenced in the default and remedies section so there is no ambiguity about available remedies.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: Prohibited assignment should be voidable but should not constitute an automatic default. Cure period of 10 business days. No deposit forfeiture for a technical violation.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If buyer insists on a cure period, concede 5 business days (not 10) to reverse the prohibited assignment. If the assignment is reversed within the cure period, no default occurs.
2. If buyer insists that deposit forfeiture is disproportionate, concede that the prohibited-assignment default is subject to the same liquidated damages limitation as other buyer defaults (typically the deposit), rather than an independent forfeiture right.
3. If buyer insists on decoupling voiding from default, concede that voiding the assignment does not automatically constitute a default, BUT seller may declare a default if the buyer does not reverse the assignment within the cure period.
4. Do not concede the elimination of default consequences entirely. A prohibited assignment with no consequences is not a prohibition -- it is a suggestion.

### Risk Assessment

- **Low risk with strong consequences**: The deterrent effect is high. Buyers with competent counsel will not violate a clearly drafted assignment restriction with deposit-forfeiture consequences.
- **Moderate risk with a cure period**: The buyer can attempt a prohibited assignment, observe the seller's reaction, and reverse it if the seller objects -- effectively testing the assignment without consequences.
- **High risk with no default consequences**: The assignment restriction is unenforceable in practice. The buyer can assign at will, knowing the seller's only remedy is to void the assignment (which may be impractical if the assignee has already begun performing).

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types**: Prohibited assignment consequences are contractual and asset-type agnostic.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions**: Courts universally enforce voidable-at-election provisions. The seller's election to void does not require a judicial determination -- the seller's notice to the buyer is sufficient.
- **California**: Under Cal. Civ. Code Section 1671, liquidated damages in non-residential real estate transactions are presumed valid. Deposit forfeiture as a consequence of prohibited assignment should be enforceable.
- **New York**: New York courts enforce liquidated damages provisions if the amount is reasonable in light of anticipated harm and actual damages are difficult to ascertain. The deposit amount in a $50M+ transaction is generally upheld as reasonable.

## Timing of Assignment Notice

### Preferred Position

Require the longest practicable notice period to give the seller maximum time to evaluate the assignee and update closing documents:

- Notice of any proposed assignment shall be given at least 10 business days before the proposed effective date of the assignment (or before closing, whichever is earlier).
- The notice shall include: (a) the full legal name of the assignee, (b) the assignee's state of organization, (c) the assignee's principal office address, (d) the assignee's signature block, (e) the executed assumption agreement, (f) the assignee's organizational documents (certificate of formation, operating agreement), (g) evidence of compliance with the Affiliate definition (including ownership charts and management structure), and (h) the assignee's ERISA and AML certifications.
- Seller shall have no obligation to close until at least 5 business days after receipt of a complete assignment notice (i.e., the notice period effectively extends the closing date if the notice is given too close to closing).
- An incomplete notice shall not satisfy the notice requirement. Seller may request additional information, and the notice period shall not begin to run until all requested information is provided.

The UNICO forms require only 2 business days' notice, which is insufficient for the seller to review organizational documents and update closing deliverables. The Detailed Seller PSA requires 5 days, which is better but still tight for complex structures.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Push for 10 business days as the starting point. In complex transactions with multiple closing documents (deed, bill of sale, lease assignment, contract assignment, FIRPTA certificate, closing statement), the seller's counsel needs time to review the assignee's documents, update all closing deliverables, and coordinate with the title company.
- Require a complete notice package, not merely a name and address. The UNICO forms require only "the full legal name and signature block" of the assignee -- this is insufficient for the seller to evaluate the assignee's compliance with the Affiliate definition and assignment conditions.
- If the buyer provides late notice, the seller should have the right to delay closing -- not the obligation to accept the assignment despite late notice. The closing delay should be at the seller's option, not automatic.
- Require the buyer to deliver the assumption agreement in executed form with the notice, not after the notice. This prevents the buyer from providing notice at the deadline and then negotiating the assumption agreement during the notice period.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer's likely position**: 2-3 business days' notice with minimal documentation (name and signature block only). Late notice should not void the assignment.

**Fallback sequence**:
1. If buyer insists on fewer than 10 business days, concede 5 business days but require the full documentation package at the time of notice.
2. If buyer resists the documentation requirement, concede to name, signature block, organizational chart, and an officer's certificate confirming Affiliate status. Reserve the right to request additional documentation if compliance is not evident from the certificate.
3. If buyer insists that late notice should not void the assignment, concede this but preserve the seller's right to delay closing by the number of business days the notice was late, plus 3 additional business days for review.
4. If buyer insists on 2 business days (the UNICO standard), accept this only if the buyer provides a preliminary notice at least 10 business days before closing identifying the anticipated assignee, with the formal notice (including executed assumption agreement) due 2 business days before closing.

### Risk Assessment

- **High risk with short notice periods (2-3 business days)**: Seller's counsel may not have time to review the assignee's organizational documents, confirm Affiliate status, update closing deliverables, or coordinate with the title company. Errors at closing are more likely.
- **Moderate risk with 5 business days**: Generally sufficient for straightforward Affiliate assignments, but tight for complex structures (TIC, DST, multi-entity).
- **Low risk with 10 business days**: Ample time for review and document preparation. The seller is fully protected.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Portfolio deals**: In multi-property dispositions with staggered closings, the notice period should run separately for each property closing. The buyer may assign different properties to different entities.
- **Complex structures (TIC/DST)**: Longer notice periods are essential. A 35-co-tenant TIC assignment requires review of 35 sets of organizational documents and execution of 35 assumption agreements.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions**: Notice provisions are contractual and are enforced as written. There is no default notice period for assignment under the common law of any jurisdiction.
- **States with document recording requirements**: In states where the deed and assignment documents must be recorded, the notice period must account for document preparation time. Title companies typically require final closing documents 24-48 hours before the scheduled recording time.

---

## Cross-Referencing Notes

- **Default and Remedies (Section 12)**: Ensure the default provisions expressly list a prohibited assignment as a buyer default, cross-referencing the assignment section. The liquidated damages/deposit forfeiture provision should apply to prohibited-assignment defaults.
- **Representations and Warranties (Section 5)**: Require the assignee to make the same representations as the original buyer (organizational authority, ERISA, AML, no litigation, financial capacity). Include an express provision that the seller may rely on the original buyer's representations until receipt of a valid assignment notice with the assignee's updated representations.
- **Closing Mechanics (Section 9)**: The closing deliverables section should require seller to update closing documents to reflect the assignee only upon receipt of a valid, timely, and complete assignment notice. If notice is late or incomplete, seller is entitled to prepare closing documents in the name of the original buyer.
- **Definitions (Section 1)**: The Affiliate definition should be in the definitions section and should be cross-referenced in the assignment clause. Anchor the definition to the Effective Date to prevent post-signing manipulation.
- **Conditions Precedent (Section 7)**: Include as a condition precedent to seller's obligation to close that "Buyer has not made a prohibited assignment." This gives the seller an affirmative right to refuse to close if a prohibited assignment has occurred, independent of the default remedies.
- **Indemnification and Survival (Section 13)**: Ensure that post-closing indemnification obligations run against both the original buyer and any assignee, jointly and severally. The survival period should not be shortened or otherwise affected by an assignment.
