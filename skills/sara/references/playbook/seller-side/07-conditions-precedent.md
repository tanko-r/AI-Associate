# Conditions Precedent to Closing — Seller Playbook

This playbook addresses the Conditions Precedent to Closing provisions of a commercial real estate purchase and sale agreement from the **seller** perspective. It is designed for use by AI agents conducting contract review on behalf of institutional sellers disposing of income-producing commercial real estate ($50M+ deals). The conditions precedent section defines the circumstances under which seller can be compelled to close -- and the circumstances under which buyer can walk away with its deposit. From seller's perspective, the overriding objective is to minimize buyer's termination rights after the due diligence period has expired, while preserving seller's own conditions and ensuring deal certainty.

## Buyer Representations and Warranties True at Closing

### Preferred Position

Seller should require, as a condition precedent to seller's obligation to close, that all of buyer's representations and warranties be true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date. Buyer should be required to deliver a closing certificate reaffirming its representations. This is seller's counterpart to buyer's "bring-down" condition, and it ensures buyer has the authority, capacity, and legal standing to close.

**Preferred language:**

> As a condition precedent to Seller's obligation to close, the representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in Section [X] shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date, as though made at and as of the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall have delivered to Seller a certificate certifying to the foregoing.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 10.2.2) provides: "There shall be no material breach of any representations and warranties made by Purchaser in Article 6, above, and such representations, warranties or covenants shall have remained true and correct in all material respects." The Meadows form (Section 7.1) requires that "all representations and warranties made by Buyer in Section 5.2 hereof shall be true and correct in all material respects as if made on and as of the Closing Date" and requires delivery of a Buyer's Closing Certificate. The ASB/Hardware Block form (Section 6.2) requires buyer's representations to be "true, complete and accurate subject to changes that: (y) are caused by the acts or omissions of Seller or its agents or affiliates; or (z) cannot reasonably be expected, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on Seller."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Seller's bring-down condition should mirror (and be no less protective than) buyer's bring-down condition. If buyer's bring-down includes a "dual date" requirement (true as of both the Effective Date and the Closing Date), seller's should as well.
- Key buyer representations to bring down include: authority to transact, no litigation affecting buyer's performance, compliance with anti-money laundering laws, OFAC compliance, non-ERISA status (if applicable), and source of funds representations.
- Require delivery of a Buyer's Closing Certificate. This creates an independent document delivery condition and provides evidentiary support for post-closing claims.
- The "material respects" qualifier is standard for buyer's bring-down. Seller should not agree to bring buyer's representations down "in all respects" (which would give seller a trivial termination right and invite bad-faith behavior).
- The ASB/Hardware Block form includes a useful carve-out from buyer's bring-down for changes "caused by the acts or omissions of Seller." This is reasonable -- seller should not be able to engineer a condition failure by its own conduct.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer's representations are limited in scope (authority, capacity, OFAC) and are unlikely to become untrue between signing and closing. The bring-down condition is unnecessary.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Insist on the bring-down condition and closing certificate as non-negotiable. These are standard in all institutional transactions.
2. Accept the "material respects" qualifier.
3. Accept a carve-out for changes caused by seller's own conduct.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Buyer's representations are narrower in scope than seller's, and the risk that buyer's representations become untrue is lower. However, this condition is essential protection against buyer fraud, insolvency, or loss of authority between signing and closing.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Buyer's representations are substantially identical across asset classes. The bring-down condition does not vary by asset type.
- **Data Center / Life Sciences:** Buyer may be a specialized operator with regulatory requirements. Ensure buyer's representations cover any required governmental approvals for ownership.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** No material jurisdictional variation for buyer's bring-down condition.

## Buyer Delivery of Purchase Price

### Preferred Position

Seller should require, as a condition precedent to seller's obligation to close, that buyer shall have deposited the balance of the Purchase Price into escrow in immediately available funds, together with all other amounts due from buyer at Closing. This is the most fundamental seller condition.

**Preferred language:**

> As a condition precedent to Seller's obligation to close, Seller shall have received confirmation from Escrow Agent that it has received the payment of the Purchase Price in accordance with Section [X] (subject to the adjustments, apportionments and credits as provided for herein) and all other amounts due to Seller from Purchaser hereunder, and that Escrow Agent is in possession of written authorization from Purchaser to disburse such funds at the direction of Seller at Closing.

**Cross-reference:** The ASB/Hardware Block form (Section 6.2(c)) includes the most protective version: seller requires "confirmation from Escrow Agent that it has received the payment of the Purchase Price... and that Escrow Agent is in possession of written authorization from Purchaser to disburse such funds at the direction of Seller at Closing." The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 10.2.4) conditions seller's obligation on "Purchaser's delivery to escrow of the funds, documents and items specified in Section 11.5." The Seller-Side Income Property form (Section 5.5(a)) states: "Buyer shall have deposited the Closing Payment into escrow."

### Key Negotiation Points

- The condition should require not merely that buyer has "deposited" funds, but that the Escrow Agent has confirmed receipt of immediately available, cleared funds. Wire transfers should be verified as "good funds" before seller authorizes recording.
- Include a requirement that buyer has authorized the Escrow Agent to disburse funds to seller upon closing. This prevents buyer from depositing funds but then instructing the Escrow Agent to hold or return them.
- The Purchase Price should be "subject to adjustments, apportionments and credits" -- not a fixed dollar amount. This prevents disputes over prorations from blocking closing.
- If the transaction involves a loan assumption, the condition should include buyer's delivery of all assumption-related funds (assumption fees, escrow deposits, reserve replenishments).
- Seller should also require that buyer deposit any additional funds necessary to close (transfer taxes payable by buyer, buyer's share of closing costs, etc.).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer should be required to deliver funds "on or before the Closing Date" but should not be required to pre-fund. Buyer may also argue that the condition should be limited to the Purchase Price, not "all other amounts."

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept that buyer must deposit funds by a specified time on the Closing Date (e.g., "no later than 1:00 p.m. local time").
2. Accept that "all other amounts" is limited to amounts that are ascertainable under the Closing Statement.
3. Never waive the purchase price delivery condition. This is non-negotiable.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — Without confirmation of good funds, seller risks recording the deed and transferring title without receiving payment. This condition should never be waived and should be verified by the Escrow Agent before any closing documents are released for recording.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** No material variation. The purchase price delivery condition is universal.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** "Good funds" requirements vary by state. Many states have good funds statutes that require the title company to verify receipt of wire-transferred funds before disbursing. Seller should confirm that the escrow instructions are consistent with applicable good funds requirements.
- **New York:** New York City transactions involve the NYC Real Property Transfer Tax (RPTT) and New York State transfer tax. Confirm that buyer's deposit includes all transfer tax amounts payable by buyer (if allocated to buyer).

## Buyer Delivery of Closing Documents

### Preferred Position

Seller should require, as a condition precedent to seller's obligation to close, that buyer shall have delivered all documents required to be delivered by buyer at Closing. While buyer's closing document obligations are typically lighter than seller's, they are nonetheless essential.

**Preferred language:**

> As a condition precedent to Seller's obligation to close, Purchaser shall have executed and delivered to Seller (or deposited into escrow) all the documents required to be delivered by Purchaser at the Closing, including: (i) counterpart assignments; (ii) transfer tax declarations; (iii) entity authorization documents; and (iv) such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Title Company, Escrow Agent, or applicable law.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 10.2.4) conditions seller's obligation on "Purchaser's delivery to escrow of the funds, documents and items specified in Section 11.5." The Seller-Side Income Property form (Section 5.5(b)) requires: "Buyer shall have delivered those items described in Section 11.4 hereof." The Pro-Buyer IL form (Section 14.01) requires that "Purchaser shall have: (i) executed and delivered to Seller all the documents required to be delivered by Purchaser at the Closing."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Buyer's required closing documents typically include:
  - Counterpart Assignment and Assumption of Leases
  - Counterpart Assignment and Assumption of Contracts and Intangibles
  - Counterpart Bill of Sale
  - Transfer tax declarations/affidavits (to the extent required of buyer)
  - Real Estate Excise Tax Affidavit (Washington) or equivalent
  - Entity authorization documents (resolutions, incumbency certificates, certificates of good standing)
  - Buyer's Closing Certificate (bring-down)
  - Loan assumption documents (if applicable)
  - Such other documents as the Title Company or Escrow Agent may reasonably require
- Each document form should be attached as an exhibit to the PSA, negotiated at signing, and not left open for closing.
- Seller should resist buyer's attempts to add extensive "reasonably required" language that could allow buyer to demand unanticipated documents at closing.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer's closing documents are ministerial and should not be elevated to a condition precedent. Buyer may argue that seller's sole remedy for buyer's failure to deliver documents is buyer default (not condition failure).

**Fallback chain:**

1. Insist that buyer's document delivery is a condition. This is standard in all institutional transactions and should not be controversial.
2. Accept that documents need only be "substantially" in the forms attached as exhibits.
3. Accept that Title Company requirements are limited to "customary" requirements (not open-ended).

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — Buyer's document delivery failure is typically a symptom of a larger problem (buyer's inability or unwillingness to close). The condition provides seller with a clean termination right if buyer fails to cooperate.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Buyer's closing document list is substantially consistent. Asset-specific additions may include utility transfer authorization forms (data center), Housing Authority transfer documents (multifamily with Section 8), or liquor license transfer applications (hospitality/retail).

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** No material jurisdictional variation in the condition itself. The specific documents required vary by jurisdiction (transfer tax forms, recording requirements, etc.).

## Seller's Conditions Precedent — Limiting Buyer's Closing Conditions

### Preferred Position

From seller's perspective, the most important negotiation regarding conditions precedent is **limiting the scope and number of buyer's closing conditions.** Every buyer condition is a potential termination right that threatens deal certainty. Seller's overriding objective is to push as much risk as possible into the due diligence period (where buyer has a free look) and minimize conditions that survive into the post-diligence period.

**Seller's preferred structure for buyer conditions (limited to):**

1. Seller's representations and warranties true at Closing (with carve-outs -- see below)
2. Seller's compliance with covenants
3. Title Company committed to issue Title Policy
4. Seller's delivery of closing documents
5. Estoppel delivery (with seller estoppel substitution rights)

**Conditions seller should resist:**

- Material Adverse Change (MAC) conditions
- No-tenant-default conditions (standalone)
- Tenant occupancy conditions
- Financing contingency
- Regulatory approval conditions (beyond title)
- No-injunction conditions (buyer benefit)

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 10.1) includes only four buyer conditions: (1) seller covenant compliance and truth of representations, (2) title policy issuance, (3) estoppel delivery, and (4) seller's delivery of closing documents. Notably, it does not include a standalone MAC condition, no-tenant-default condition, no-injunction condition, or tenant occupancy condition. The Seller-Side Income Property form (Section 5.4) is even more limited: (1) seller's delivery of closing items, (2) title policy, and (3) truth of seller's representations.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **MAC Condition:** Resist vigorously. Seller should argue that buyer had a full due diligence period to evaluate the property and that the bring-down condition and casualty/condemnation provisions provide adequate protection against changes between signing and closing. If buyer insists, see the fallback chain below.
- **No-Tenant-Default Condition:** Resist. Seller cannot control tenant behavior. Buyer's protection comes from the estoppel certificates and the bring-down of seller's representations regarding tenant defaults.
- **Tenant Occupancy Condition:** Resist. This is a buyer overreach that seller should not accept in institutional transactions.
- **No-Injunction Condition (for buyer's benefit):** Resist as a standalone buyer condition. If included, it should be mutual.
- **Financing Contingency:** Absolutely resist. Institutional commercial real estate transactions do not include financing contingencies. The UNICO forms expressly state: "It is understood and agreed, however, that Purchaser's ability to obtain financing for the acquisition of the Property is not a condition to Purchaser's obligation to close."

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer needs adequate conditions to protect its investment between signing and closing. The conditions are standard in institutional transactions.

**Fallback chain for MAC condition:**

1. Refuse the MAC condition entirely and rely on bring-down, casualty/condemnation, and estoppel provisions.
2. If buyer insists, accept a MAC condition with a high dollar threshold (e.g., 10% of Purchase Price) and a narrow definition that excludes general market conditions, changes in law, and force majeure events.
3. Accept a MAC condition limited to specific, objective triggers (e.g., bankruptcy of a Major Tenant) rather than a subjective "material adverse change" standard.
4. Accept a MAC condition with a specific rent roll test (e.g., diminution of more than 10% in aggregate base rent), but resist qualitative catch-alls.
5. If the MAC condition is accepted, ensure that it does not give buyer damages -- only a termination right with deposit return.

**Fallback chain for no-tenant-default condition:**

1. Refuse the standalone condition and rely on estoppels and bring-down.
2. If buyer insists, limit the condition to Major Tenants with monetary defaults exceeding a stated threshold.
3. Accept the condition but include a seller cure right (seller may cure the default before closing, with a closing extension if necessary).
4. Accept the condition but provide that it is deemed satisfied if the applicable tenant estoppel does not disclose the default.

**Fallback chain for tenant occupancy condition:**

1. Refuse entirely.
2. If buyer insists, limit to specifically named anchor tenants (retail only).
3. Accept that the condition is satisfied if the tenant is paying rent, regardless of physical occupancy.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — Each additional buyer condition is a termination right that reduces deal certainty. In a market with rising interest rates or declining values, buyer may be economically motivated to invoke a condition (even marginal) to exit a transaction at above-market pricing. Seller must treat each buyer condition as a potential escape hatch and negotiate accordingly.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Buyer's conditions are typically limited to the standard five listed above. Resist MAC and tenant occupancy conditions.
- **Industrial:** Single-tenant deals may warrant a limited occupancy condition for the sole tenant. Multi-tenant deals should follow the office framework.
- **Retail:** Anchor tenant occupancy may be a legitimate buyer concern. Seller may need to concede a limited occupancy condition for named anchors, but should negotiate a rent-payment test rather than a physical-occupancy test.
- **Multifamily:** Buyer conditions should be minimal beyond the standard five. Resist any condition tied to occupancy rates or effective rents.
- **Data Center:** Buyer may argue for conditions related to power availability and utility infrastructure. Resist these as standalone conditions and address them through representations and covenants.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** The number and scope of buyer conditions is a function of deal negotiation, not statutory requirements. Seller's leverage determines the outcome.
- **New York:** The NY Checklist (buyer-side resource) recommends extensive buyer conditions. Seller should be prepared to resist the NY Checklist framework, which is aspirational from buyer's perspective.

## Estoppel Delivery — Seller's Perspective

### Preferred Position

Seller should accept an estoppel delivery condition but negotiate maximum flexibility in satisfying it. Seller's preferred structure includes: (a) a reasonable percentage threshold (no more than 70-75% of leased NRA), (b) the right to substitute seller estoppel certificates for tenant estoppels (including for a portion of Major Tenants), (c) a commercially reasonable efforts obligation (not an absolute obligation), (d) acceptance of lease-form estoppels, and (e) deemed approval of estoppels delivered during the due diligence period.

**Preferred language:**

> Seller shall use good faith efforts to obtain estoppel certificates confirming the accuracy in all material respects of the Lease Schedule from Tenants covering at least seventy percent (70%) of the leased square footage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller is unable to obtain sufficient estoppel certificates from Tenants to meet the requirement, Seller may, at its sole option, substitute Seller's Estoppel Certificates for (y) up to one-half (by number) of the Major Tenants and (z) Non-Major Tenants to the extent necessary. Purchaser agrees that in no event shall the failure of Seller to obtain sufficient estoppel certificates constitute a default by Seller under this Agreement.

**Cross-reference:** The ASB/Hardware Block form (Section 6.1(a)(iv)) sets the threshold at 70% and permits seller estoppel substitution for up to one-half of Major Tenants. The UNICO Buyer Side form (Section 10.1.3) sets the threshold at 80%, which is buyer-favorable. The Seller-Side Income Property form (Section 7.3(d)) uses bracketed percentages and requires Minimum Tenant Estoppels. The Pro-Buyer IL form (Section 21.01) requires estoppels from "each and every Tenant" -- the most aggressive buyer position, which seller should resist.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Percentage threshold:** Seller should target 65-75% of leased NRA. The ASB/Hardware Block form's 70% threshold is a reasonable seller position. Resist 80% or higher.
- **Major Tenant estoppels:** Seller should retain the right to substitute seller estoppel certificates for a portion of Major Tenants. The ASB/Hardware Block form permits substitution for up to one-half of Major Tenants (by number). This is seller's preferred position.
- **Effort standard:** "Good faith efforts" or "commercially reasonable efforts" -- not an absolute obligation. Seller cannot compel tenants to execute estoppels.
- **No default for estoppel failure:** Expressly provide that failure to obtain estoppels does not constitute a seller default. The ASB/Hardware Block form states this explicitly. This is critical -- it means buyer's remedy for estoppel failure is limited to termination with deposit return, not damages or specific performance.
- **Deemed approval:** Estoppels delivered to buyer before the end of the study period should "conclusively" count toward the requirement. Buyer should not be able to re-litigate estoppels it reviewed during diligence. The ASB/Hardware Block form includes this provision.
- **Short objection periods:** Buyer should have only 2-3 business days to object to post-diligence estoppels, with deemed approval for non-response.
- **Lease-form estoppels:** If the tenant's lease prescribes a specific estoppel form, delivery of an estoppel in that form should satisfy the requirement regardless of buyer's preferred form.
- **Knowledge qualifiers:** Estoppels that limit statements to "tenant's knowledge" or include general reservations ("subject to audit rights") should count toward the threshold. The ASB/Hardware Block form expressly provides that buyer cannot reject estoppels solely for these reasons.
- **Seller's right to extend Closing for estoppels:** Seller should have the right to extend the Closing Date (e.g., by 30-60 days) to provide additional time to obtain estoppels. The ASB/Hardware Block form grants seller extensions of up to 60 days in total.
- **Post-closing estoppel substitution:** After closing, seller should be entitled to continue pursuing tenant estoppels and should be released from liability under seller estoppel certificates to the extent a subsequently obtained tenant estoppel is consistent with the seller estoppel.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer needs estoppels from all Major Tenants (no substitution) and from a high percentage of total tenants (80-90%). Buyer may argue that seller estoppel certificates provide weaker protection.

**Fallback chain (seller concessions):**

1. Increase the percentage threshold to 75%, but retain seller estoppel substitution rights for at least one-quarter of Major Tenants.
2. Eliminate seller estoppel substitution for Major Tenants, but retain substitution rights for Non-Major Tenants.
3. Increase the threshold to 80%, but only if seller retains the right to extend closing for up to 30 days to obtain additional estoppels.
4. Accept buyer's preferred estoppel form, but with a fallback to the lease-form estoppel if the tenant refuses to sign buyer's form.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — The estoppel condition is one of the most common sources of closing delays and deal failures. Seller cannot control tenant cooperation. Aggressive estoppel conditions give buyer an easy exit right that is difficult for seller to prevent. Seller must negotiate maximum flexibility in the estoppel provisions to preserve deal certainty.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Major Tenants are typically sophisticated and will negotiate estoppel forms. Allow adequate time for tenant-landlord negotiation on estoppel content.
- **Industrial:** Single-tenant deals require a single estoppel. If the sole tenant refuses, seller may need to postpone closing or deliver a seller estoppel certificate.
- **Retail:** Anchor tenants often have lease-prescribed estoppel forms and extended response periods. National retail tenants (e.g., Target, Walmart, Home Depot) use their own corporate forms and may take 30-60 days to respond. Build adequate lead time into the closing schedule.
- **Multifamily:** Estoppels are not customary for residential tenants. If the property has commercial tenants, those estoppels should follow the office framework.
- **Data Center:** Data center tenants may require extended review periods for estoppels due to the complexity of the lease terms (power, cooling, SLAs).

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** No statutory estoppel obligation for commercial tenants. The obligation is contractual and flows from the lease.
- **New York:** The NY Checklist recommends buyer require estoppels from "each and every" tenant. This is the most aggressive position and is routinely negotiated down in practice.

---

## Bring-Down of Seller Representations — Seller's Perspective

### Preferred Position

Seller should accept a bring-down condition for its representations but negotiate maximum flexibility in the bring-down mechanics. Seller's preferred structure includes: (a) a "material respects" qualifier, (b) carve-outs for changes in the ordinary course of business, (c) carve-outs for changes caused by buyer, (d) deemed modification of representations by information in due diligence materials and estoppels, and (e) a robust anti-sandbagging provision.

**Preferred language:**

> On the Closing Date, the Seller Representations shall be true, complete and accurate, subject to: (A) changes that: (x) are caused by the acts or omissions of Purchaser or its agents or affiliates; (y) cannot reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect from and after the Closing; or (z) are a result of the ownership, operation, management and/or leasing of the Property in the normal course of business in compliance with [pre-closing covenants]; and (B) any modification (or deemed modification) to any Seller Representation pursuant to [anti-sandbagging provisions]; provided, however, that with respect to any Seller Representation that is made as of the Effective Date (or another specified date), this condition shall be satisfied so long as such Seller Representation was true, complete and accurate in all material respects as of the Effective Date or such other specified date.

**Cross-reference:** The ASB/Hardware Block form (Section 6.1(a)(ii)) uses this precise structure. The Meadows form (Section 7.2) requires truth "in all material respects as if made on and as of the Closing Date" with a seller right to postpone closing for up to 7 days to cure.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **MAE qualifier on bring-down:** Changes between signing and closing that do not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect should not trigger the condition. This is seller's most important protection against trivial bring-down failures.
- **Ordinary course carve-out:** Changes resulting from normal property operations (leasing, maintenance, contract administration) conducted in compliance with pre-closing covenants should not trigger the condition.
- **Buyer-caused changes:** Changes caused by buyer's acts or omissions (e.g., buyer's inspections causing damage, buyer's personnel creating disruption) should not trigger the condition.
- **Anti-sandbagging:** All seller representations should be automatically deemed modified to reflect buyer's knowledge as of the end of the study period. The ASB/Hardware Block form (Section 7.4(a)) achieves this result directly. This prevents buyer from closing with knowledge of a representation breach and then asserting a post-closing claim.
- **Deemed modification by estoppels:** If a tenant estoppel contains information inconsistent with a seller representation, the representation should be deemed modified by the estoppel. The ASB/Hardware Block form (Section 6.1(a)(iv)) includes this provision.
- **Date-specific representations:** Representations made "as of the Effective Date" should be judged as of the Effective Date only -- they should not be brought down to the Closing Date. This is important for representations regarding existing conditions (e.g., rent roll accuracy, existing litigation) that may naturally change over time.
- **Seller's right to update/cure:** If seller discovers that a representation has become untrue between signing and closing, seller should have the right (but not the obligation) to notify buyer and cure the misrepresentation, with a closing extension if necessary. The Seller-Side Income Property form (Section 7.3(f)) provides a detailed update-and-cure mechanism, including seller's right to extend closing for cure and buyer's termination right (but no damages claim) if seller cannot cure.
- **Buyer's sole remedy for bring-down failure:** If seller cannot cure a bring-down failure, buyer's sole remedy should be termination with deposit return. Buyer should not have a damages claim for bring-down failure unless it constitutes an intentional or willful breach.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The bring-down should be clean and unqualified. Buyer needs assurance that the property is substantially the same asset at closing as it was at signing. Anti-sandbagging provisions unfairly shift diligence risk to buyer.

**Fallback chain (seller concessions):**

1. Accept a "material respects" qualifier without the MAE overlay (i.e., the representation must be true in "all material respects" rather than subject only to changes that do not have an MAE).
2. Accept a narrower ordinary course carve-out (limited to leasing activities conducted with buyer's consent).
3. Accept a modified anti-sandbagging provision that deems representations modified only by information "expressly" contained in written due diligence materials delivered to buyer (not constructive knowledge).
4. Accept that the bring-down applies to all representations, including date-specific ones, but with a materiality qualifier.
5. Accept that buyer retains a termination right for bring-down failure, but seller retains a cure right (with closing extension).

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — The bring-down condition is buyer's most powerful closing condition. An unqualified bring-down exposes seller to termination risk from any change in circumstances, no matter how minor. Seller must negotiate robust carve-outs to protect deal certainty.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Lease-related representations (tenant defaults, rent roll accuracy) are most likely to change between signing and closing. The ordinary course carve-out is essential.
- **Industrial:** Environmental representations are the highest risk. Include a specific carve-out for environmental conditions discovered after the study period that were not caused by seller.
- **Retail:** Tenant turnover and co-tenancy triggers can cause representation changes. The MAE qualifier is essential for retail transactions.
- **Multifamily:** Occupancy and rent roll representations change daily. Seller should insist on date-specific representations ("as of the Effective Date") for these items.
- **Data Center:** Power and utility representations should be date-specific.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** The bring-down mechanics are contractual. No statutory framework governs the bring-down condition.
- **Delaware:** Anti-sandbagging provisions are generally enforceable under Delaware law. Some states (e.g., New York) have less clarity on the enforceability of pro-sandbagging provisions.

---

## Waiver Mechanics — Seller's Perspective

### Preferred Position

Seller's conditions should be for the exclusive benefit of seller, waivable only by seller in writing. Buyer's conditions should be for the exclusive benefit of buyer, waivable only by buyer. Seller should insist on a "deemed waiver" provision at Closing, whereby any unsatisfied condition is deemed waived upon consummation of the transaction.

**Preferred language:**

> The conditions set forth in Section [Buyer's Conditions] are for the exclusive benefit of Purchaser. The conditions set forth in Section [Seller's Conditions] are for the exclusive benefit of Seller. If any condition has not been satisfied or waived within the period provided, this Agreement may be terminated by the party for whose benefit such condition exists, by written notice to the other party. After the Closing, any such condition that has not been satisfied shall be treated as having been waived in writing.

**Cross-reference:** The Meadows form (Sections 7.1 and 7.2) includes both the "exclusive benefit" language and the deemed waiver provision. The Seller-Side Income Property form (Section 5.6) provides: "The conditions set forth in Sections 5.1 through 5.4 are for the exclusive benefit of Buyer and the conditions set forth in Section 5.5 are for the exclusive benefit of Seller."

### Key Negotiation Points

- Seller should insist on the "deemed waiver at Closing" provision. This forecloses buyer from asserting condition-based termination rights after closing has occurred. It forces buyer to raise condition failures before closing or lose them forever.
- The deemed waiver should be broad: "any condition that has not been satisfied shall be treated as having been waived in writing." This covers all conditions, not just a subset.
- The deemed waiver should explicitly state that it constitutes a "waiver in writing" to satisfy any contractual requirement that waivers be in writing.
- Seller should also insist that a waiver of one condition does not constitute a waiver of seller's remedies for buyer's default. The Meadows form (Section 7.1) includes this protection: "No such waiver shall constitute a waiver by Seller of any of its rights or remedies if Buyer defaults."
- Resist any provision that gives buyer the right to waive seller's conditions. Each party's conditions should be waivable only by that party.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** The deemed waiver at closing should not extinguish post-closing claims for breach of representations and warranties.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept that the deemed waiver does not affect claims under representations and warranties that expressly survive closing (within the stated survival period).
2. Accept that the deemed waiver does not affect claims based on seller's fraud or intentional misrepresentation.
3. Resist any expansion of the deemed waiver exception beyond representations/warranties and fraud. The deemed waiver should extinguish all other condition-based claims.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — The waiver mechanics are procedural, but they determine whether buyer can attempt to unwind the transaction after closing based on unsatisfied conditions. The deemed waiver provision is seller's primary protection against post-closing condition-based claims.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** No material variation.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Courts enforce contractual waiver provisions, including deemed waivers, as written. The parol evidence rule generally prevents parties from contradicting written waiver provisions.

## Failure of Condition Consequences — Seller's Perspective

### Preferred Position

Seller should structure the consequences of condition failure to maximize seller's recovery and minimize buyer's exits. Seller's preferred structure:

1. **Failure of seller's condition (buyer's breach):** Seller retains the Earnest Money Deposit as liquidated damages. Seller may also pursue specific performance or actual damages (depending on the form).
2. **Failure of buyer's condition (not due to seller's breach):** Buyer may terminate with deposit return, but seller has no liability for damages or costs. The condition failure does not constitute a seller default.
3. **Failure of buyer's condition (due to seller's breach):** Buyer may terminate with deposit return and may pursue remedies under the default provisions, but seller should negotiate caps on liability.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 10.1) provides: "Purchaser shall not terminate this Agreement without giving Seller notice of the failure of such condition and a period of 5 Business Days after delivery of such notice for Seller to cause such condition to be satisfied." This cure period is critical for seller. The Pro-Buyer IL form (Section 14.03) expressly provides: "The failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Section 14.02 that is not reasonably susceptible of being satisfied within the time allotted... shall not constitute a default, breach of a covenant, or other failure to perform by Seller hereunder unless the non-satisfaction of such condition is a result of a breach or default by Seller."

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Cure period:** Seller should always have a cure period (5 business days is market) before buyer can terminate for a failed condition. The cure period should be measured from seller's receipt of buyer's written notice specifying the failed condition.
- **No default for condition failure:** Failure of a buyer condition should not automatically constitute a seller default. This distinction is critical -- it means buyer's remedy is limited to termination with deposit return, not damages or specific performance. The Pro-Buyer IL form makes this distinction explicitly, and seller should adopt it.
- **Seller's closing extension right:** Seller should have the right to extend the Closing Date to provide additional time to satisfy conditions (e.g., obtain estoppels, cure representation breaches). The ASB/Hardware Block form grants seller extensions of up to 60 days in total.
- **No buyer cost reimbursement:** Seller should resist any provision requiring seller to reimburse buyer's out-of-pocket due diligence costs upon termination for failed conditions. The Pro-Buyer IL form includes "Purchaser's Costs" in the termination refund, but this is an aggressive buyer position that seller should resist.
- **Deposit forfeiture for buyer's condition failure:** The Meadows form (Section 7.1) provides that if seller's conditions are not satisfied, the Deposit "shall be paid to Seller." This is the most seller-favorable structure -- it treats any failure of seller's conditions as a buyer default with automatic deposit forfeiture. While aggressive, this is a useful bargaining position.
- **Escrow dispute provisions:** Include an interpleader provision allowing the Escrow Agent to deposit disputed funds with a court, relieving seller of the need to resolve deposit disputes directly with buyer.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer is entitled to a full deposit return upon termination for any failed buyer condition, regardless of fault. Buyer may also argue for cost reimbursement and damages if the failure is seller's fault.

**Fallback chain (seller concessions):**

1. Accept that buyer receives a full deposit return upon termination for a failed buyer condition not caused by seller's breach (this is market).
2. Accept that buyer may pursue remedies under the default provisions if the condition failure is caused by seller's breach, but subject to the liability caps and limitations in the default provisions.
3. Accept a reasonable cure period (5 business days) before buyer can terminate.
4. Resist cost reimbursement in all cases.
5. Resist any provision that converts a condition failure into a seller default.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — The consequence of condition failure determines seller's economic exposure. If buyer can terminate with a full deposit return for any reason, the earnest money deposit provides no deal certainty. Seller must ensure that condition failures not caused by seller's breach are treated as no-fault terminations, and that condition failures caused by buyer's breach are treated as buyer defaults with deposit forfeiture.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** No material variation in the consequence framework.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Courts enforce liquidated damages provisions in commercial real estate transactions if the amount is a "reasonable estimate of actual damages" at the time of contracting. Seller should ensure the liquidated damages provision satisfies this standard.
- **California:** Cal. Civ. Code Section 1671(b) provides that liquidated damages provisions in commercial contracts are valid unless the party seeking to invalidate the provision establishes that it was unreasonable at the time of contracting.
- **New York:** New York courts enforce liquidated damages provisions in commercial contracts unless the amount is "plainly or grossly disproportionate" to probable loss.

## Mutual Conditions

### Preferred Position

Seller should limit mutual conditions to items that genuinely require both parties' cooperation and that neither party can unilaterally control. True mutual conditions are rare in institutional commercial real estate transactions. The most common mutual condition is the approval of an existing loan assumption.

**Preferred language:**

> [If applicable:] As a condition precedent to the obligations of both Seller and Purchaser, the Existing Loan Assumption Approval shall have been obtained.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO forms (both Buyer Side and Seller Side) include optional text for an "Existing Loan Assumption Approval" as a mutual condition. No other mutual conditions appear in the precedent forms.

### Key Negotiation Points

- Loan assumption approval is the paradigmatic mutual condition. Neither party controls the lender's decision, and both parties should have the right to terminate if approval is not obtained.
- Seller should resist buyer's attempts to characterize other conditions as "mutual" (e.g., no-injunction, regulatory approvals). These conditions, if included at all, should be classified as buyer conditions (for buyer's benefit) or seller conditions (for seller's benefit).
- If a mutual condition fails, the consequence should be termination with deposit return, regardless of which party invokes the termination right. Neither party should be entitled to damages for failure of a mutual condition.
- The mutual condition should include an obligation for both parties to use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy it (e.g., both parties cooperate with the lender's assumption process).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Several conditions should be mutual, including no-injunction and regulatory approvals.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a no-injunction mutual condition, but only for orders that specifically prohibit the sale/purchase transaction.
2. Resist all other mutual conditions.
3. If a condition is truly mutual, ensure that the consequence is termination with deposit return and that neither party has a damages claim.

### Risk Assessment

**LOW** — Mutual conditions are relatively rare and typically non-controversial. The primary risk is that buyer uses the mutual classification to expand its termination rights.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** Mutual conditions are rare and do not vary by asset type. Loan assumption is the primary example.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** No material jurisdictional variation.

## Title Policy Condition — Seller's Perspective

### Preferred Position

Seller should accept the title policy issuance condition (this is universal and non-negotiable) but negotiate the scope of the condition to ensure that seller is not responsible for title defects created by buyer or third parties after the Effective Date.

**Preferred language:**

> As a condition precedent to Purchaser's obligation to close, the Title Company shall be irrevocably committed to issue the Title Policy insuring Purchaser's title to the Property subject only to the Permitted Exceptions.

### Key Negotiation Points

- "Permitted Exceptions" should be a defined term established through the title review process during diligence. Seller should resist any expansion of the Permitted Exceptions definition after the diligence period.
- Seller should not be responsible for endorsement costs beyond the standard owner's policy premium. Extended coverage premiums and endorsement costs should be allocated to buyer.
- Seller should be obligated to remove "Mandatory Title Removal Items" -- typically defined as: (a) monetary liens (mortgages, tax liens, judgment liens) created by or through seller, (b) mechanic's liens arising from seller's work, and (c) any other encumbrances voluntarily created by seller. Seller should not be required to remove title defects that exist as of the Effective Date and were disclosed in the title commitment, except for monetary liens.
- The Pro-Buyer IL form (Section 7.02(b)) includes a "Monetary Lien Cap" -- the maximum amount seller is required to spend to remove monetary liens. If the cost of removal exceeds the cap, seller may elect not to remove, and buyer may terminate. This is a useful seller protection.
- Seller should not be required to commence litigation or spend more than a stated amount to cure title objections (other than monetary liens).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Seller should cure all title defects, including those existing as of the Effective Date, as a condition to closing.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept an obligation to remove all monetary liens (including existing mortgages) at or before closing. This is non-negotiable.
2. Accept an obligation to remove new encumbrances created by seller between signing and closing.
3. Resist any obligation to cure title defects that existed as of the Effective Date and were disclosed in the title commitment (buyer had the opportunity to object during diligence).
4. Accept a Monetary Lien Cap to limit seller's out-of-pocket exposure for removing monetary liens (appropriate only for liens created by third parties, not seller's own mortgages).

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — The title policy condition is universal and non-controversial. Seller's risk is primarily related to undisclosed liens or encumbrances that emerge between signing and closing. Seller should maintain its insurance, pay its debts, and avoid creating new encumbrances during the gap period.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The title policy condition does not vary materially by asset type. Data center and industrial properties may have more complex easement structures (fiber routes, utility corridors, rail spurs) that require careful title review.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **Texas:** Title insurance rates are regulated. Seller should be aware that certain endorsements may not be available or may have regulated pricing.
- **Iowa:** No private title insurance. Title guaranty certificates are issued through the Iowa Finance Authority.
- **New York:** Customary to use bargain and sale deed with covenants against grantor's acts. The title company's requirements for the owner's title affidavit and gap indemnity vary.

## Casualty and Condemnation — Seller's Perspective

### Preferred Position

Seller should negotiate the casualty and condemnation provisions to minimize buyer's termination rights and maximize the likelihood of closing. Seller's preferred structure: (a) high dollar threshold for "Material Casualty" (requiring buyer to close for minor events), (b) buyer must elect to terminate within a short period or be deemed to have elected to proceed, (c) seller retains the right to repair before closing, and (d) seller retains insurance proceeds for pre-closing repairs.

**Preferred language:**

> Purchaser shall be bound to purchase the Property for the full Purchase Price, without regard to any damage or condemnation, provided that: (a) the cost to repair such damage, or the diminution in value from a partial condemnation, equals $[threshold] or less; (b) any condemnation does not impair access to the Property; and (c) upon Closing, there shall be a credit against the Purchase Price equal to insurance proceeds or condemnation awards collected by Seller, plus the deductible amount, less sums expended by Seller toward restoration.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO Seller Side form (Section 12.1) uses a $1,000,000 threshold (compared to $500,000 in the Buyer Side form). The ASB/Hardware Block form uses the defined term "Material Casualty." The Meadows form (Section 6.3) ties the threshold to Seller's determination of restoration cost, which is seller-favorable. The Pro-Buyer IL form (Section 17.01) gives buyer the right to terminate for any "material portion" casualty, with a default to termination if buyer fails to elect.

### Key Negotiation Points

- **Dollar threshold:** Seller should set the threshold as high as possible relative to the Purchase Price. A threshold of 2-5% of Purchase Price is market. The UNICO Seller Side form uses a fixed $1,000,000 threshold.
- **Deemed election to proceed:** If buyer does not elect to terminate within the specified period (typically 10 business days), buyer should be deemed to have elected to proceed. All precedent forms include this "deemed election to proceed" provision. The Pro-Buyer IL form is an exception -- it defaults to termination if buyer fails to elect, which is buyer-favorable and should be resisted.
- **Seller's right to repair:** Seller should retain the right (but not the obligation) to repair damage before Closing. If seller repairs, buyer should not have a termination right.
- **Insurance proceeds allocation:** For minor casualties, buyer should receive a credit equal to insurance proceeds collected, plus the deductible, less seller's repair costs. For major casualties where buyer elects to proceed, buyer should receive the same credit plus an assignment of rights to uncollected proceeds.
- **Condemnation participation:** If condemnation proceedings are pending, seller should retain the right to participate in settlement negotiations (at least through Closing).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Buyer should have a termination right for any material casualty or condemnation, and the threshold should be low.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a threshold at 2% of Purchase Price (rather than 5%).
2. Accept that the threshold applies to both physical damage and diminution in value.
3. Accept that buyer's election period is 10 business days (rather than 5).
4. Accept that buyer receives a credit for uninsured losses as well as insured losses (if buyer elects to proceed).
5. Resist the Pro-Buyer IL form's default-to-termination structure.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH** — A casualty or condemnation between signing and closing can give buyer a free exit from the transaction. In a declining market, buyer may use a minor casualty as a pretext to renegotiate or terminate. Seller must set the threshold high enough to prevent this behavior while still providing buyer with a legitimate exit for truly material events.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **Office:** Water damage is the most common casualty. Set threshold to account for typical water damage repair costs.
- **Industrial:** Environmental spills from tenant operations can constitute both a casualty and an environmental event. Ensure the casualty provisions are coordinated with environmental representations.
- **Retail:** Casualty to an anchor space can cascade through co-tenancy provisions. The economic impact may far exceed the physical repair cost. Seller should argue that the threshold is measured by physical repair cost, not economic impact.
- **Multifamily:** Fire damage to individual units can be repaired relatively quickly. Seller should argue for a higher threshold relative to purchase price.
- **Data Center:** Data center casualties (power failures, cooling system failures) can be uniquely destructive. Seller should ensure that equipment failures that do not damage the building are not treated as "casualties" under the PSA.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **UVPRA states:** In states that have adopted the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act, risk of loss generally remains with seller until title passes. The contractual provisions typically supersede the statutory framework.
- **New York:** N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law Section 5-1311 (UVPRA) provides that risk of loss remains with seller for material destruction but passes to buyer for immaterial destruction. The contractual provisions should be consistent with (and typically supersede) this statute.

## Seller's Closing Extension Rights

### Preferred Position

Seller should negotiate the right to extend the Closing Date, at seller's sole option, if buyer's conditions cannot be satisfied by the original Closing Date. This is one of seller's most valuable tools for preserving deal certainty.

**Preferred language:**

> Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the conditions set forth in this Section or any other condition of Closing shall not have been fulfilled on or before the Closing Date, Seller shall have the right (in its sole discretion), exercisable by written notice to Purchaser at or before the Closing, to extend the Closing Date for one or more periods of up to sixty (60) days in total to provide additional time for the fulfillment of such conditions.

**Cross-reference:** The ASB/Hardware Block form (Section 6.1(b)) grants seller the right to extend the Closing Date for up to 60 days in total. The Meadows form (Section 7.2) grants seller the right to postpone closing for up to 7 days to cure representation breaches.

### Key Negotiation Points

- The extension right should be at seller's sole discretion -- not subject to buyer's consent.
- The extension period should be meaningful (at least 30 days, preferably up to 60 days).
- The extension should not require seller to post additional consideration or make any payment.
- The extension should apply to all buyer conditions, not just specific conditions.
- Buyer should not be able to terminate during the extension period (seller's extension tolls buyer's termination right).

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** Seller should not have an open-ended right to delay closing. Buyer may argue for a shorter extension period or a requirement that seller demonstrate good faith efforts to cure.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Accept a shorter extension period (30 days instead of 60).
2. Accept that the extension right is available only once (no multiple extensions).
3. Accept that buyer may terminate if the condition remains unsatisfied at the end of the extension period.
4. Accept that buyer retains the right to earn interest on the deposit during the extension period.

### Risk Assessment

**MODERATE** — The closing extension right is seller's insurance policy against condition failures. Without it, seller faces the choice of closing with unsatisfied conditions or losing the deal. The extension right provides a middle ground.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The extension right is most commonly invoked for estoppel delivery delays. No material variation by asset type.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** Closing extension rights are contractual and universally enforceable. "Time is of the essence" provisions in the PSA may need to be reconciled with the extension right.

## Financing as a Non-Condition — Seller's Position

### Preferred Position

Seller should insist that buyer's ability to obtain financing is expressly disclaimed as a condition to buyer's obligation to close. This is standard in institutional commercial real estate transactions and reflects the principle that buyer bears the financing risk.

**Preferred language:**

> It is understood and agreed, however, that Purchaser's ability to obtain financing for the acquisition of the Property is not a condition to Purchaser's obligation to close on the purchase of the Property hereunder.

**Cross-reference:** The UNICO forms (both Buyer Side, Section 9.3, and Seller Side, Section 9.3) include this language verbatim. The ASB/Hardware Block form (Section 6.1(c)) includes a similar disclaimer: "Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to perform under this Agreement is not contingent upon Purchaser's ability to obtain any... debt or equity financing for acquisition of the Property." The Pro-Buyer IL form (Section 3.04) includes a "Financing Contingency" provision, but this is unusual for institutional deals and should be deleted.

### Key Negotiation Points

- This provision should be non-negotiable in institutional transactions. If buyer requires a financing contingency, the deal structure is more akin to a residential or small commercial transaction.
- Seller should cooperate with buyer's financing efforts (providing access for lender inspections, requesting estoppels/SNDAs, providing financial information), but none of these cooperation obligations should be conditions to closing.
- If buyer's lender requires certain conditions (e.g., environmental reports, zoning confirmations, specific endorsements), those should be addressed during the due diligence period, not as closing conditions.

### Counterparty Pushback and Fallbacks

**Buyer will argue:** In certain market conditions (rising rates, credit tightening), buyer may legitimately need a financing contingency.

**Fallback chain:**

1. Refuse the financing contingency entirely. This is the market standard for institutional deals.
2. If buyer insists (in extraordinary circumstances), limit the financing contingency to the due diligence period only. After the due diligence period expires, buyer's obligation to close becomes unconditional regardless of financing.
3. If a financing contingency must be extended beyond diligence, require buyer to post additional earnest money (e.g., 5% of Purchase Price, going hard upon waiver of financing contingency) to compensate seller for the additional optionality.
4. Never accept an open-ended financing contingency that runs through the Closing Date.

### Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL** — A financing contingency gives buyer a free exit right that seller cannot control. In a rising-rate environment, buyer may be unable to obtain financing at underwritten returns and may invoke the contingency to terminate. Seller loses deal certainty and may need to re-market the property at a lower price.

### Asset-Type Variations

- **All asset types:** The no-financing-contingency principle applies uniformly. Data center and life science transactions may involve specialized financing that takes longer to arrange, but this does not justify a financing contingency -- buyer should have its financing committed before signing.

### Jurisdictional Notes

- **All jurisdictions:** No statutory requirement for a financing contingency in commercial transactions. The no-financing-contingency principle is market standard nationwide for institutional deals.
