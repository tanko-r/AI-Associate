<objective>
Define the closing document drafting workflow in deal-workflows.md, add closing document quality standards to work-product-standards.md, and enhance document-drafter.md and delegation-model.md with deal document drafting patterns.

Purpose: Enables Sara to extract deal terms from a PSA and SARA.md and draft standard closing documents (deed, assignment and assumption, estoppel certificates, escrow holdback agreement) with jurisdiction-specific adjustments, producing separate files with a cover note that flags items requiring partner review.

Output: Completed Workflow 3 in deal-workflows.md, closing document standards in work-product-standards.md, enhanced document-drafter.md with deal document patterns, updated delegation-model.md with closing document briefing template.

Replace the Workflow 3 stub in deal-workflows.md with a complete behavioral specification. Follow the same level of detail and tone as Workflows 1 and 2. The workflow must implement all locked decisions from the phase context.

**Workflow 3: Closing Documents from PSA**

### Purpose
Draft standard closing documents from a finalized PSA: deed, assignment and assumption of leases, estoppel certificates, and escrow holdback agreement -- to the extent called for in the PSA.

### Input
- PSA (required)
- SARA.md (if it exists from prior workflows -- strongly preferred, as it contains extracted deal terms)
- Jurisdiction/state (optional -- Sara asks if not provided and cannot be inferred from the PSA or SARA.md)

### Output
- Separate document files per type, with deal-specific naming:
  - deed-[property-shortname].docx
  - assignment-[property-shortname].docx
  - estoppel-[tenant-name].docx (one per tenant)
  - holdback-[property-shortname].docx
- Cover note (markdown)
- Updated SARA.md

### Steps

#### Step 1: Read PSA/SARA.md and Identify Required Documents
1. Read SARA.md if it exists (strongly preferred -- contains extracted deal terms from prior workflows)
2. If no SARA.md: read PSA using read_docx and extract deal terms
3. Determine which closing documents the PSA requires:
   - Deed: required in virtually all PSA transactions (type depends on PSA -- special warranty deed is standard for commercial)
   - Assignment and assumption of leases: required if property has tenants
   - Estoppel certificates: required if PSA has estoppel requirements (identify which tenants, thresholds)
   - Escrow holdback agreement: required only if PSA provides for a holdback (identify amount, purpose, conditions)
   - Other documents: identify any additional closing deliverables called for in the PSA (e.g., FIRPTA affidavit, authority certificates, bill of sale for personal property)
4. Confirm jurisdiction: check SARA.md, PSA governing law provision, property location. If ambiguous, ask the partner.
5. Extract deal terms needed for each document type (see Pattern 4 in research for detail):
   - Parties (full legal names), property description (legal description from exhibits if available), purchase price, closing date, permitted exceptions, lease schedule, tenant information, holdback terms

#### Step 2: Milestone Check-in (Document List and Key Terms)
Present the document plan to the partner:
> "Based on the PSA, I'll draft the following closing documents: [list]. Key terms I'll use: [buyer], [seller], [property address], [purchase price], [closing date], [jurisdiction]. Any adjustments?"

Also flag:
- Documents the PSA calls for that Sara cannot draft (e.g., lender-specific documents)
- Terms Sara could not determine from available documents (will use placeholders)
- Jurisdiction-specific requirements Sara plans to include

Wait for confirmation or corrections.

#### Step 3: Draft Each Document
Sara drafts closing documents from scratch (no template). For delegation: Sara extracts deal terms and provides precise specifications, then delegates individual document drafting to document-drafter if doing so improves quality. Sara reviews each draft before finalizing.

**Deed (Special Warranty Deed -- standard for commercial RE unless PSA specifies otherwise):**
- Grantor/Grantee (from PSA parties)
- Consideration (purchase price)
- Property description (legal description from PSA exhibits; use [LEGAL DESCRIPTION] placeholder if not available)
- Warranty covenants limited to grantor's period of ownership
- Subject to permitted exceptions (from PSA definition)
- State-specific requirements:
  - Witness/notary blocks (varies by state)
  - Transfer tax language (where required)
  - Recording information block
  - Any state-specific statutory form language
- Sara flags: jurisdiction requirements she cannot verify, unusual permitted exceptions

**Assignment and Assumption of Leases:**
- Assignor (seller) / Assignee (buyer)
- Property description
- Effective date (closing date)
- Lease schedule (from PSA exhibits or tenant information; use [LEASE SCHEDULE] placeholder if not available)
- Assignor assigns and assignee assumes all rights and obligations under the leases
- Indemnification: assignor indemnifies for pre-closing breaches; assignee indemnifies for post-closing breaches
- Prorations reference (rent prorations per PSA closing adjustment provisions)
- Sara flags: leases requiring consent to assignment, leases with transfer restrictions

**Estoppel Certificate (one per tenant, batched):**
- Landlord name (buyer entity, post-closing; or current landlord name with assignment reference)
- Tenant name, lease date, amendment dates
- Premises description
- Current base rent, percentage rent (if applicable), additional rent
- Security deposit amount
- Lease term (commencement, expiration, renewal options)
- Prepaid rent
- Tenant improvements or allowances outstanding
- Defaults by landlord or tenant (certify none, or specify)
- Options (renewal, expansion, ROFR, purchase option)
- Sara extracts tenant information from PSA lease schedule and rent roll (if available); uses [TENANT NAME], [LEASE DATE], etc. placeholders for information not available
- Produce separate files: estoppel-[tenant-name-kebab].docx
- Process all tenants in one pass for efficiency

**Escrow Holdback Agreement (only if PSA provides for holdback):**
- Parties: buyer, seller, escrow agent (from PSA)
- Holdback amount and source (typically portion of purchase price held in escrow)
- Purpose of holdback (specific items: repairs, tenant improvements, title cure, etc.)
- Release conditions (what must happen for funds to be released, to whom, in what amounts)
- Timeline for completion of holdback items
- Default provisions (what happens if conditions are not met within the timeline)
- Dispute resolution for holdback disputes
- Escrow agent provisions (liability limitation, resignation, fees)
- Sara flags: holdback triggers she cannot determine from PSA alone

For each document, Sara tracks:
- Placeholders used (for cover note)
- Provisions requiring partner review (for cover note)
- Provisions populated from PSA that need verification (for cover note)
- Issues noticed during drafting (for cover note and SARA.md)

#### Step 4: Generate Cover Note
Compile the cover note from items tracked during drafting. Structure the cover note with one section per document:

```
## Cover Note: Closing Documents -- [Property Name]

### General Notes
- Jurisdiction: [state] -- jurisdiction-specific provisions (deed formalities, transfer tax, notary requirements) included based on general legal knowledge. **Partner should verify compliance with current [state] requirements.**
- [Any other cross-cutting notes]

### Deed
**Populated from PSA:** [list provisions successfully populated]
**Requires partner review:**
- [List specific provisions needing review]
**Needs factual verification:**
- [List items populated but needing confirmation]
**Placeholders (unfilled):**
- [List all [BRACKETED] placeholders in the deed]

### Assignment and Assumption
[Same structure]

### Estoppel Certificates ([N] tenants)
[Same structure]

### Escrow Holdback Agreement
[Same structure]

### Issues Flagged
- [Any concerning provisions noticed during extraction/drafting]
```

Every closing document set MUST have a cover note. A closing document without a cover note is an incomplete deliverable.

#### Step 5: Update SARA.md
- Update Deal Summary if new information was extracted
- Append to Work Product Log: date, "Closing Documents", output file names, document count
- Append to Issues Flagged: any new issues identified during drafting

**document-drafter.md updates:**

Add a new section after "Transmittal Package Assembly" called "Closing Document Drafting". This section tells the document-drafter how to handle closing document assignments from Sara:

```
## Closing Document Drafting

When Sara delegates closing document drafting, she provides extracted deal terms and precise document specifications. Your job is to produce a complete, professional draft of each assigned document.

### Document Types

**Deed (Special Warranty Deed):**
- Use the deal terms Sara provides: grantor, grantee, property description, consideration, permitted exceptions
- Include state-specific formalities if Sara specifies the jurisdiction (witness blocks, notary jurat, transfer tax language, recording information)
- If jurisdiction not specified, use generic formalities with a note
- Standard special warranty deed structure: granting clause, habendum, warranty covenants (limited to grantor's period), subject-to clause, execution block

**Assignment and Assumption of Leases:**
- Use Sara's provided lease schedule and party information
- Standard structure: recitals, assignment clause, assumption clause, indemnification (pre/post-closing), prorations reference, general provisions
- If lease schedule not provided, use [LEASE SCHEDULE] placeholder

**Estoppel Certificate:**
- Sara provides tenant information for each estoppel
- Standard certification format: lease identification, rent amounts, term, security deposit, defaults, options
- Tenant certifies to buyer and buyer's lender (if applicable)
- Use [BRACKETED] placeholders for any information Sara did not provide

**Escrow Holdback Agreement:**
- Sara provides holdback terms: amount, purpose, conditions, timeline
- Standard structure: recitals, holdback terms, release conditions, timeline, default, escrow agent provisions, general provisions

### Quality Standards for Closing Documents
- Complete drafts -- every section fully written, no outline sections
- Use defined terms consistently (match PSA defined terms where applicable)
- [BRACKETED] placeholders for missing information -- never invent facts
- Cross-references to PSA provisions where appropriate
- Professional formatting: numbered sections, signature blocks, notary blocks where needed
- Each document is self-contained and independently executable
```

Also update the skill description in the frontmatter to add closing document examples:
- Add an example for closing document delegation (Sara provides deal terms, drafter produces deed/assignment/estoppel/holdback)

**delegation-model.md updates:**

Add to the "Delegate to `document-drafter`:" section:
- Closing document drafting from Sara's extracted deal terms (deeds, assignments, estoppels, holdbacks)

Add a closing document briefing template variant to the Document-Drafter Briefing Template section:
```markdown
### Closing Document Briefing Template (Document-Drafter)

## Delegation Briefing -- Closing Document Drafting

**Matter:** [matter name]
**Document type:** [deed / assignment / estoppel / holdback]
**Jurisdiction:** [state, if applicable]

### Deal Terms
[Extracted deal terms relevant to this document: parties, property, purchase price, closing date, etc.]

### Document-Specific Terms
[Terms specific to this document type: permitted exceptions for deed, lease schedule for assignment, tenant info for estoppel, holdback terms for holdback]

### Jurisdiction Notes
[State-specific requirements Sara has identified, or "Use generic formalities -- jurisdiction TBD"]

### Output Requirements
- Save to: [path]
- File name: [deal-specific name per naming convention]
- Format: docx via write_docx
- Use [BRACKETED] placeholders for any information not provided
- Flag any provisions where you made assumptions: [NOTE: Assumed X because Y]
```

**work-product-standards.md updates:**

Replace the closing documents stub (added by 03-01) with complete standards. Add sections for each document type:

**Closing Documents (General):**
- Every closing document is drafted from scratch (no pre-built templates)
- Professional legal document formatting: numbered sections, signature blocks, defined terms
- State-specific provisions when jurisdiction is specified
- [BRACKETED] placeholders for information not available
- Each document is a separate file with deal-specific naming
- Cover note always accompanies closing document set

**Special Warranty Deed:**
- Structure: preamble (grantor/grantee/consideration), granting clause, habendum, warranty covenants, subject-to clause, execution block (witnesses, notary, recording info)
- Standards: warranty limited to grantor's period of ownership, consideration stated, property description from PSA exhibits, permitted exceptions referenced
- State-specific: deed type conventions, witness requirements, notary format, transfer tax language, recording page

**Assignment and Assumption of Leases:**
- Structure: recitals, assignment, assumption, indemnification, prorations, general provisions, signature blocks
- Standards: effective as of closing date, clear allocation of pre/post-closing liability, lease schedule attached as exhibit

**Estoppel Certificate:**
- Structure: tenant identification, lease identification, certifications (rent, term, defaults, options, deposits), signature block
- Standards: one per tenant, addressed to buyer and buyer's lender, all material lease terms certified
- Batched: all tenants processed together, separate files

**Escrow Holdback Agreement:**
- Structure: recitals, holdback amount and purpose, release conditions, timeline, default, escrow agent provisions, general provisions, signature blocks
- Standards: specific release conditions (not vague), timeline for completion, clear default consequences
