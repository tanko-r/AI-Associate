<objective>
Create clause-library.md and market-standards.md stubs with the same 24-category structure as the PSA checklist, then wire all 3 reference files into Sara's Step 3 workflow with graceful degradation, coverage reporting, † LLM-source markers, and missing provisions reporting.

Purpose: Completes the knowledge layer by adding model language and market data stubs, and integrates all reference files into Sara's existing contract review workflow so she loads them automatically during framework building.

Output: 2 new stub files + behavioral updates to 4 existing files (SKILL.md, contract-review-workflow.md, document-reviewer.md, document-drafter.md).

  <action>
Create both stub files with the same 24-category heading structure as re-checklist-psa.md. Follow the format specified in 02-RESEARCH.md > Code Examples > Examples 2 and 3.

**clause-library.md:**

1. Header block with:
   - Usage: Sara loads during Step 3 for model language reference
   - Population instructions: Add model language from negotiated deals
   - Entry format template:
     ```
     ### [Clause Name]
     **Source:** [Deal type, approximate date, anonymized]
     **When to use:** [Circumstances where this clause is appropriate]
     **Language:**
     > [Exact clause text]
     **Notes:** [Any caveats, modifications needed for different deal types]
     ```

2. Category index (same 24 categories, same numbering)

3. 24 category sections, each with:
   - Heading: `## N. Category Name`
   - 2-4 placeholder sub-section headings per category for common clause types (e.g., under Definitions: "Knowledge Qualifier -- Broad (Buyer-Favorable)", "Knowledge Qualifier -- Standard", "MAE/MAC Definition -- Standard")
   - Each sub-section: `[TODO: Add model [clause type] language from negotiated deals]`
   - Sub-section names should correspond to the checklist's review points where model language would be useful

**market-standards.md:**

1. Header block with:
   - Usage: Sara loads during Step 3 for market data reference
   - Population instructions: Add market standard data from deal experience
   - Note about format refinement (GitHub issue #1)

2. Category index (same 24 categories, same numbering)

3. 24 category sections, each with:
   - Heading: `## N. Category Name`
   - 2-4 placeholder sub-section headings per category for key market data points (matching the `See: market-standards.md` cross-references in re-checklist-psa.md)
   - Each sub-section: `[TODO: Document market standard for [topic] in institutional CRE PSAs]`

**Cross-reference consistency:** Category numbers and names MUST be identical across all 3 files. The sub-section headings in market-standards.md must match the `See:` cross-references in re-checklist-psa.md.
  </action>
  <verify>
Both files exist. Grep confirms all 24 category headings present in each file. Category names and numbers match re-checklist-psa.md. [TODO] placeholders present in both files.
  </verify>
  <done>
clause-library.md and market-standards.md exist with matching 24-category structure, descriptive sub-section placeholders, and user population instructions.

Modify 4 existing files to integrate reference file loading, coverage reporting, † markers, and missing provisions reporting.

**1. contract-review-workflow.md — Add Step 3-pre before Step 3a:**

Insert a new section `### 3-pre: Load Reference Files` before the existing `### 3a: Identify What to Research`. Content:

- For PSA reviews, Sara reads 3 files via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/sara/references/`:
  1. `re-checklist-psa.md` — PSA review checklist
  2. `clause-library.md` — model language reference
  3. `market-standards.md` — market data reference
- **Best-effort loading:** If a file is not found, note the absence and proceed with LLM knowledge. Do not halt the review.
- **Selective loading:** Read the checklist's category index first. Then load only the categories that match the document's structure from the Step 2 initial read. For a standard PSA, this will typically be 18-22 of 24 categories. Skip categories that clearly do not apply.
- **Coverage report [MVP]:** Count populated vs `[TODO]` placeholder categories in each file. Include in the Step 3d framework presentation. Example: "Reference files loaded. PSA checklist: [N]/24 categories have firm-specific content, [M] categories using general legal knowledge. Clause library: [X]/24 populated. Market standards: [Y]/24 populated."

Also modify `### 3c: Build the Target List` to add: "Merge checklist review points with research-derived target lists. Checklist items provide the structured baseline; research items add document-specific and deal-specific additions."

Also modify `### 3d: Present the Framework` to add the coverage report to the milestone check-in presentation.

**2. SKILL.md — Add reference file section and degradation behavior:**

In the section after "Analysis Framework Gate" and before "Milestone Check-Ins", add a new section `## Reference Files [MVP]` with:

- Sara loads practice-area-specific reference files during Step 3 of contract review (see contract-review-workflow.md Step 3-pre)
- Available reference files for RE/PSA: re-checklist-psa.md, clause-library.md, market-standards.md
- **LLM fallback [MVP]:** When a checklist item contains a `[TODO]` placeholder, Sara uses her own legal knowledge but explicitly states she is doing so: "Using general knowledge — no firm-specific reference data for this item"
- **† marker [MVP]:** In the disposition table and transmittal memo, append `†` to any assessment sourced from LLM knowledge rather than the reference files. This lets the partner distinguish checklist-backed from LLM-backed assessments.
- **Missing provisions report [Permanent]:** After the disposition table, Sara generates a list of checklist items the PSA does not address. Report Common items (categories 1-13) as potential gaps. Report Specialized items (categories 14-24) only when deal context suggests they should be present.
- Note: These MVP features (coverage report, LLM fallback, † markers) are tracked for removal once reference files are fully populated.

**3. document-reviewer.md — Add † marker convention:**

Find the Section A disposition table format section. Add a note explaining the `†` marker:
- When a review point or risk assessment comes from Sara's general knowledge (not the PSA checklist or market standards file), append `†` to the Market Assessment column value.
- Example: `Below market†` means "market assessment based on general legal knowledge — no firm-specific reference data."
- The reviewer receives Sara's reference file status in the delegation briefing and applies `†` accordingly.

**4. document-drafter.md — Add † marker convention:**

Find the transmittal memo section. Add a note:
- When a recommendation under Key Changes or Open Items is not backed by the checklist or market standards file, append `†` to the recommendation.
- The drafter receives Sara's reference file status in the delegation briefing and applies `†` accordingly.

**IMPORTANT — Preserve existing content:** These are edits to existing files. Read each file fully before modifying. Add new sections/content without removing or altering existing behavior. The changes are additive.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. contract-review-workflow.md contains "3-pre: Load Reference Files" section
2. SKILL.md contains "Reference Files" section with LLM fallback, † marker, and missing provisions report
3. document-reviewer.md contains "†" marker convention
4. document-drafter.md contains "†" marker convention
5. All 4 files still have their existing content intact
  </verify>
  <done>
All 4 files updated: contract-review-workflow.md has Step 3-pre for reference file loading with selective loading and coverage reporting; SKILL.md has reference file section with degradation behavior; document-reviewer.md and document-drafter.md have † marker conventions. Sara will now load reference files during Step 3, report coverage, mark LLM-sourced items, and generate missing provisions reports.

clause-library.md and market-standards.md exist as structured stubs matching the PSA checklist's 24-category structure. Sara's workflow is wired to load all 3 reference files during Step 3 with best-effort loading, selective reading, coverage reporting, LLM fallback with explicit disclosure, † source markers, and missing provisions reporting. All behavioral changes are additive to existing files.
