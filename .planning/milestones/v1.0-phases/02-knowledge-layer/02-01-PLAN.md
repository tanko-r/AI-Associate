<objective>
Create the RE-specific PSA review checklist stub (re-checklist-psa.md) with all 24 provision categories, comprehensive sub-items sourced from 3 sample documents, Key Risks tables with buyer/seller columns, and [TODO] placeholders for firm-specific content.

Purpose: This is the primary knowledge artifact Sara loads during Step 3 (framework building) to ensure systematic, comprehensive coverage of every PSA provision category. It replaces the ad-hoc, LLM-only framework building that led to the "19 of 170" problem.

Output: `skills/sara/references/re-checklist-psa.md` — a structured checklist with 24 categories, ~400-500 review points, Key Risks tables, and placeholder content.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Extract sub-items from all 3 sample documents</name>
  <files>
    .sample-docs/PSA form (extremely detailed, seller side).docx
    .sample-docs/PSA - (Pro-Buyer Long Form) (IL).doc
    .sample-docs/PSA Negotiation Checklist (Commercial Real Estate) (Purchaser) (NY).doc
  </files>
  <action>
Read all 3 sample documents using docx tools (read_docx / extract_structure for .docx, binary text extraction for .doc files). Use the category-to-source mapping table from 02-RESEARCH.md to systematically extract sub-items for each of the 24 categories.

For each category:
1. Find the corresponding sections in each sample document (use the mapping table in RESEARCH.md > Source Document Analysis > Mapping: 24 Categories to Source Documents)
2. Extract every distinct concept, provision, and review point from each source
3. Prioritize the NY Negotiation Checklist's practitioner-framed language — it is already written as review guidance
4. Frame sub-items as imperative review points: "Check whether...", "Verify that...", "Confirm that..."
5. Identify buyer-perspective and seller-perspective risks for the Key Risks table
6. Note which sub-items need [TODO] placeholders for firm-specific content vs which are self-contained review points

Target: 10-25 sub-items per Common category (categories 1-13), 5-15 per Specialized category (categories 14-24). Every sub-item must trace to a specific provision or concept in at least one sample document.

Save extraction notes for use in Task 2.
  </action>
  <verify>
Extraction covers all 24 categories with sub-items traced to source documents. Each category has at least 5 sub-items. The NY Checklist's practitioner framing is used where available.
  </verify>
  <done>
Sub-items extracted for all 24 categories, organized by category with source attribution, ready to write into the checklist file.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Write re-checklist-psa.md with full 24-category structure</name>
  <files>skills/sara/references/re-checklist-psa.md</files>
  <action>
Write `skills/sara/references/re-checklist-psa.md` using the extracted sub-items from Task 1. Follow the format specified in 02-RESEARCH.md > Code Examples > Example 1.

**File structure:**

1. **Header block** with usage instructions:
   - How Sara uses this file (load during Step 3, read selectively by category)
   - How the user populates it (replace [TODO] placeholders)
   - Representation note (review points are neutral; Key Risks have buyer/seller columns)

2. **Category index** — numbered list of all 24 categories (table of contents for selective loading)

3. **24 category sections**, each with:
   - Heading: `## N. Category Name [Common]` or `## N. Category Name [Specialized]`
   - `### Review Points` — checkbox-format sub-items (`- [ ] **Bold imperative** -- descriptive text`)
     - Each sub-item: bold imperative label + descriptive text explaining what to look for
     - `See:` cross-references to market-standards.md where market data is relevant
     - `[TODO: ...]` placeholders where firm-specific content belongs
   - `### Key Risks` — table with columns: Risk | Buyer Perspective | Seller Perspective
     - 3-8 risks per category sourced from the sample documents
     - Final row: `[TODO: Add additional risks from firm experience]`
   - `---` separator between categories

**Category classification:**
- **Common** (categories 1-13): Definitions, Property Description, Purchase Price & Deposit, DD/Investigation, Title & Survey, Reps & Warranties, Seller's Covenants, Conditions Precedent, Closing Mechanics, Closing Deliveries, Costs/Prorations, Casualty & Condemnation, Default & Remedies
- **Specialized** (categories 14-24): AS-IS/Disclaimers, Indemnification, Assignment, Tenant Estoppels, Escrow, Brokerage, Confidentiality, Tax Proceedings, Assumption of Contracts, Mortgage Assignment, Miscellaneous

**Quality checks before saving:**
- All 24 categories present in correct order
- Every category has both Review Points and Key Risks sections
- [Common] or [Specialized] tag on every category heading
- Sub-items use consistent checkbox format with bold imperatives
- [TODO] placeholders are descriptive (say what to fill in, not just "[TODO]")
- Cross-references use format: `See: market-standards.md > Category > Topic`
- Key Risks tables have both buyer and seller columns
- Review points are representation-neutral (no "negotiate for the buyer" — that goes in Key Risks)
  </action>
  <verify>
File exists at `skills/sara/references/re-checklist-psa.md`. Grep for all 24 category headings confirms they are present. Grep for `[Common]` and `[Specialized]` tags confirms classification. Grep for `[TODO` confirms placeholder presence. File is 600+ lines (comprehensive content).
  </verify>
  <done>
re-checklist-psa.md exists with all 24 categories, comprehensive sub-items, Key Risks tables, Common/Specialized tags, [TODO] placeholders, and cross-references to market-standards.md. File is ready for Sara to load during Step 3.
