## Cross-Phase Integration (14/15 wired)

### Integration Issues

**INT-01 (Medium) — Delegation template missing reference file status**
- **From:** Phase 2 source marker convention (KNOW-01, KNOW-02)
- **To:** Phase 1 delegation-model.md briefing templates
- **Issue:** document-reviewer.md and document-drafter.md state "Sara provides reference file status in the delegation briefing" for `†` marker application, but the briefing templates in delegation-model.md have no "Reference File Status" field
- **Mitigation:** SKILL.md Reference Files [MVP] section and Step 3d coverage report give Sara the data; the template just doesn't prompt for it
- **Fix:** Add a "Reference File Coverage" field to the Document-Reviewer and Contract-Reviser briefing templates

**INT-02 (Medium) — Stale path reference in work-product-standards.md**
- **From:** work-product-standards.md line 257
- **To:** root-level references/contract-review-workflow.md (stale, 405 lines)
- **Issue:** Bare path `references/contract-review-workflow.md` resolves to pre-Phase-1 file missing Step 5.5, full delegation templates, and transmittal format
- **Fix:** Update to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/sara/references/contract-review-workflow.md`

**INT-03 (Low) — Workflow 3 missing delegation template cross-reference**
- **From:** deal-workflows.md Workflow 3 Step 3
- **To:** delegation-model.md Closing Document Briefing Template
- **Issue:** Workflow 3 mentions delegation but doesn't point to the specific briefing template; reachable via SKILL.md but path is indirect
- **Fix:** Add explicit cross-reference to Closing Document Briefing Template in Workflow 3

## Tech Debt

### Cross-Phase (3 items)

1. **Stale root-level `references/` directory** — contains pre-Phase-1 versions of 3 files now canonical at `skills/sara/references/`. The root copies are 45-83% shorter and lack Phase 1-3 enhancements. Should be deleted to prevent confusion.

2. **gen_calendar.py docstring** — internal usage example says `calendar.py` instead of `gen_calendar.py`. Cosmetic; all behavioral specs reference the correct name.

3. **README.md skill name** — line 30 lists `sara-associate` but actual skill is `sara`. Documentation drift.

### Phase 1 (2 items)

4. **Coverage floor calibration** — Level 4 (35+) and Level 5 (40+) revision entry floors are analytical estimates. Need empirical calibration against real PSA reviews.

5. **Human verification items** — 4 behavioral items require live test sessions: smart defaults interaction flow, coverage floor enforcement trigger, quality loop feedback specificity, and milestone check-in cadence. Identified in Phase 1 VERIFICATION.md.

**Total: 5 items across 2 categories. None are blockers.**
