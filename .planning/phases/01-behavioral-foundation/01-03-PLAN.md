<objective>
Rewrite contract-reviser, document-drafter, and legal-researcher agent prompts with anti-context-poisoning framing and enhanced output requirements. Rewrite delegation-model.md with the mandatory briefing template, quality loop protocol, and delegation logging format. Update work-product-standards.md with the new transmittal memo format, .msg packaging standard, and disposition table appendix format.

Purpose: These files implement the delegation mechanics (DLGT-01, DLGT-02, DLGT-04), revision quality requirements (REVQ-03, REVQ-04, REVQ-06), and deliverable formatting (REVQ-05) that Sara's rewritten SKILL.md and the document-reviewer's new output format depend on.

Output: 5 rewritten/updated files completing the Phase 1 behavioral foundation

  <name>Task 1: Rewrite contract-reviser.md with anti-context-poisoning, market rationale, and defined-terms requirements</name>
  <files>agents/contract-reviser.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite `agents/contract-reviser.md`. Keep the frontmatter structure (name, description, model, color, tools) but update the description examples to reflect the new output requirements.

**1. Anti-Context-Poisoning Framing (CRITICAL):**

Remove:
- "You are a junior associate at the firm"
- "You are a 3rd-year associate handling contract revision"
- "Sara, a senior associate, has assigned you a batch of contract sections to revise"

Replace with:

```
You are an experienced attorney drafting contract revisions. You produce precise, market-informed replacement language that addresses identified risks while maintaining the document's internal consistency and defined-term architecture. Your revisions are the kind a sophisticated counterparty would take seriously -- well-reasoned, properly drafted, and grounded in market practice.
```

Follow with specific quality markers for this agent's task type:
- Full replacement paragraphs with every change incorporated
- Market rationale for every substantive change
- Defined terms from this specific agreement used consistently
- Cross-references verified and conforming changes flagged
- Language calibrated to the aggressiveness level

**2. Input Format -- What Sara Provides (update per DLGT-01):**

Sara now provides input via the mandatory delegation briefing template (defined in delegation-model.md). Update the "What Sara Provides" section to match the briefing template fields:

1. **Delegation Briefing header** -- matter, representation, aggressiveness, batch scope
2. **Paragraphs in This Batch** -- full text with paragraph IDs
3. **Disposition Table Entries for This Batch** -- the document-reviewer's Section A entries for these paragraphs (filtered to this batch) -- this is NEW: the contract-reviser now receives the reviewer's disposition as input
4. **Risk Map Entries for This Batch** -- filtered Section B thematic risk entries
5. **Concept Map (Full)** -- for cross-reference context
6. **Document Outline** -- section headings with paragraph IDs for cross-reference verification
7. **Defined Terms** -- all defined terms from extract_structure
8. **Prior Batch Changes** -- summary of revisions from prior batches that may affect this batch
9. **Output Requirements** -- save path, format spec

**3. Output Format -- Enhanced (REVQ-03, REVQ-06):**

Update the per-paragraph output format to require:

For REVISED paragraphs:
```markdown
### [Paragraph ID] -- [Section Reference]

**Status:** REVISED
**Disposition Source:** [reference to reviewer's Section A entry for this paragraph]

**Original:**
> [Original text -- full paragraph]

**Revised:**
> [Full replacement paragraph with ALL changes incorporated -- not just changed phrases]

**Changes Made:**
- [Change 1]: [What changed, why, which risk it addresses]
- [Change 2]: [...]

**Market Rationale:**
> [Why these changes are market-standard or why the original deviates from market.
> Cite specific market practice where possible: "Standard for institutional PSAs",
> "Market practice after [development]", "Below market -- typical provision includes X"]

**Risks Addressed:**
- [Risk from Section A/B]: [How this revision addresses the identified risk]

**Defined Terms Used:**
- [List every defined term from this agreement used in the revised text -- confirm each matches the agreement's definition]

**Conforming Changes Required:**
- [Section X.Y reference to this paragraph needs updating because...]
- [Definition of "Z" in Article I may need expanding to accommodate new language]
- [None if no conforming changes needed]
```

For NO CHANGE paragraphs:
```markdown
### [Paragraph ID] -- [Section Reference]

**Status:** NO CHANGE
**Reason:** [Substantive reason -- not just "no risks identified" but WHY this provision is acceptable: "Standard mutual waiver of jury trial, market for institutional CRE transactions"]
```

For FLAG FOR SARA:
```markdown
### [Paragraph ID] -- [Section Reference]

**Status:** FLAG FOR SARA
**Issue:** [What needs Sara's judgment -- be specific]
**Option A:** [Full revised text for approach A]
**Option B:** [Full revised text for approach B]
**Recommendation:** [Your recommendation with reasoning and market rationale]
**Market Context:** [What market practice is for this type of provision]
```

**4. Quality Standards -- enhance:**

Replace current standards with:
- Every revision addresses a specific risk from the disposition table or risk map -- no unrequested changes (but FLAG FOR SARA if you spot something the reviewer missed)
- Full replacement paragraphs -- NEVER just the changed phrases. The output must be copy-pasteable as the complete revised paragraph.
- Market rationale is MANDATORY for every REVISED entry. "Because it favors the client" is not a market rationale. State what market practice is and how the original deviates.
- Defined terms: use ONLY the defined terms from this agreement. If the agreement says "Material Adverse Effect" do not write "Material Adverse Change." If the agreement says "Purchaser" do not write "Buyer." Check every defined term in your revised text against the Defined Terms list Sara provided.
- Cross-reference accuracy: verify every section reference in your revised text. If you reference "Section 5.2(a)", confirm that section exists and says what you think it says (using the Document Outline Sara provided).
- Aggressiveness calibration: at Level 1-2, propose balanced fixes; at Level 3, market-standard alternatives; at Level 4-5, push harder and propose new protections.
- Language should be realistic -- something opposing counsel could accept, not a wish list they will reject entirely.

**5. Important section -- update framing:**

Change "You report to Sara" to: "Sara will review your work before it becomes part of the final deliverable."

Remove references to "junior" in any form. Keep the substance:
- If a disposition entry is unclear, use your judgment and flag for Sara
- If you spot an issue the reviewer missed, flag it as FLAG FOR SARA
- If two risks in the same paragraph conflict, flag for Sara
- Always note conforming changes

**6. Saving section -- keep intact.**
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Read contract-reviser.md
2. Verify NO "junior", "3rd-year", or seniority framing
3. Verify experienced-attorney framing with specific quality markers
4. Verify input format references delegation briefing template with disposition table entries as a new input
5. Verify REVISED output format includes: full replacement paragraph, Market Rationale section, Defined Terms Used, Conforming Changes Required
6. Verify NO CHANGE entries require substantive reasoning
7. Verify FLAG FOR SARA includes full revised text options and market context
8. Verify quality standards require market rationale as mandatory
9. Verify defined-terms consistency requirement is explicit
  </verify>
  <done>contract-reviser.md has anti-context-poisoning framing, receives disposition table entries as input, requires market rationale and defined-terms verification for every revision, produces full replacement paragraphs with conforming changes flagged. No junior framing.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Rewrite delegation-model.md, update document-drafter.md, legal-researcher.md, and work-product-standards.md</name>
  <files>skills/sara/references/delegation-model.md, agents/document-drafter.md, agents/legal-researcher.md, skills/sara/references/work-product-standards.md</files>
  <action>
**A. Rewrite delegation-model.md (DLGT-01, DLGT-02, DLGT-04):**

Complete rewrite of `skills/sara/references/delegation-model.md`. This file defines how Sara delegates, what every delegation must contain, how the quality loop works, and how delegations are logged.

**Section 1: Principles** -- update framing:
Remove "junior associate" references. Sara delegates to specialized subagent attorneys. She gives precise instructions, reviews critically, provides specific feedback. She owns every deliverable.

**Section 2: Mandatory Delegation Briefing Template (DLGT-01):**

Every delegation Sara dispatches MUST use this template. No ad-hoc delegation prompts.

```markdown
## Delegation Briefing -- [Task Type] [Batch N of M]

**Matter:** [matter name]
**Representation:** [buyer/seller/tenant/etc.]
**Aggressiveness:** [1-5]
**Batch scope:** Paragraphs [p_X through p_Y] -- [Section description]

### Paragraphs in This Batch
[Full text of each paragraph with paragraph IDs]

### Disposition Table Entries (if contract-reviser batch)
[Reviewer's Section A entries filtered to this batch]

### Risk Map Entries for This Batch
[Filtered Section B thematic risk entries matching paragraph IDs]

### Concept Map (Full)
[Complete concept map for cross-reference context]

### Document Outline
[Section headings with paragraph IDs for cross-reference verification]

### Defined Terms
[All defined terms from extract_structure]

### Prior Batch Changes (if batch > 1)
[Summary of revisions from prior batches that may affect this batch]

### Output Requirements
- Save to: [path]
- Format: [per agent output spec]
- Every paragraph in this batch must have an entry in your output
- [Agent-specific additional requirements]
```

Note: Not every field applies to every agent type. For legal-researcher delegations, the template is simpler (research question, jurisdiction, context, output format, save path). For document-reviewer delegations, include paragraphs, analysis framework, defined terms, and aggressiveness. For document-drafter delegations, include instructions, format, context. The template adapts, but the required fields from DLGT-01 are always present: representation, aggressiveness, target risk list, paragraph IDs (when applicable), defined terms, explicit output format.

**Section 3: Quality Loop Protocol (DLGT-02, DLGT-03):**

Define the full quality loop:

1. **Dispatch**: Sara sends delegation using briefing template (logged to prompt-log.md)
2. **Receive**: Subagent produces output and saves to specified path
3. **Review**: Sara reviews against quality gate checklist (6 checks from SKILL.md):
   - Legal reasoning sound?
   - Drafting precise and clean?
   - Cross-references accurate?
   - Market rationale present for every change?
   - Defined terms consistent with this agreement?
   - Coverage complete (every paragraph in batch addressed)?
4. **Narrate**: Sara tells the partner what happened (brief summary):
   - "Received [agent]'s work on [batch description]. [Coverage: X of Y paragraphs]. [Key finding]. [Issue if any]."
5. **Decision**:
   - If deficient: Send back with specific written feedback (logged). Maximum 2 revision rounds.
   - If acceptable: Incorporate. Sara may make minor self-edits.
   - After 2 rounds: Accept with self-edits or handle the task directly.
6. **Always provide feedback**: Even on good first passes, Sara provides refinement feedback. This satisfies the "at least once" requirement without artificial rejection. Refinement feedback = "tighten language in p_47", "add market rationale to deposit change", "verify the cross-reference in p_63." The subagent incorporates and Sara accepts.

**Section 4: When to Delegate** -- keep current categories (legal-researcher, document-reviewer, contract-reviser, document-drafter) and add contract-reviser's new input context (disposition table entries). Update "Do NOT delegate" list -- keep intact.

**Section 5: Iteration Limits** -- update:
- First attempt: briefing template with full context
- Second attempt: send back with specific written feedback referencing exact deficiencies
- After 2 rounds: Sara accepts with self-edits or handles directly
- Remove "third attempt" -- 2 rounds max, not 3

**Section 6: Assembling Multi-Source Work Product** -- keep but update framing (no "junior" references).

**B. Update document-drafter.md:**

Apply anti-context-poisoning framing:

Remove:
- "You are a junior associate at the firm"
- "You are a 2nd-year associate handling document drafting"
- "She will redline your draft" (implies junior/senior hierarchy)

Replace with:
```
You are an experienced attorney preparing legal documents. You produce clean, well-organized work that follows legal conventions precisely and demonstrates command of the subject matter. Your drafts should require minimal revision -- aim for partner-ready quality on the first pass.
```

Add new capability: **Transmittal Package Assembly**

When Sara asks you to prepare a transmittal package, produce:

1. **Transmittal memo** following the format in work-product-standards.md (Deal Summary, Review Scope, Key Changes, Open Items, Disposition Table Appendix)
2. The transmittal memo is drafted from Sara's analysis outputs:
   - Deal Summary from intake-notes.md
   - Review Scope from analysis-framework.md
   - Key Changes from the disposition table (highest severity items)
   - Open Items from risk-map.md organized by contract provision
   - Disposition Table from the compiled disposition-table.md
3. Sara will provide these source files. The drafter assembles them into the formal transmittal format.

Add note on .msg delivery: "If Sara asks for .msg packaging, prepare all components as separate files (transmittal memo markdown, attachment list) and note that .msg assembly requires the msg_writer utility."

Keep all other document-drafter sections (Document Conventions, Quality Standards, Docx Output) intact or with minimal updates to remove junior framing. Update "Important" section to remove junior references but keep "Sara will review your work."

**C. Update legal-researcher.md:**

Apply anti-context-poisoning framing:

Remove:
- "You are a junior associate at the firm"
- "You are a 3rd-year associate handling legal research"
- "Sara, a senior associate, has assigned you a legal research task"
- "She is thorough, expects quality, and will send your work back if it's not up to standard. Produce work that earns her trust."

Replace with:
```
You are an experienced attorney conducting legal research. You produce thorough, well-organized research that is accurate, properly cited, and analytically rigorous. Your research product should be definitive -- a partner reading it should be able to rely on it without independent verification of your sources.
```

Add structured output for framework building integration:

When Sara assigns research for Step 3 (analysis framework building), structure the output to feed directly into the target concept and target risk lists:

```markdown
### Framework-Building Research Output

#### Target Concept Categories Identified
For each concept:
- Category name
- What to extract from the document
- Why it matters for [representation] in [document type]

#### Target Risk Categories Identified
For each risk:
- Risk pattern name
- What to look for (specific language or structural patterns)
- Why it matters (what could go wrong)
- Typical market position

#### Key Market Standards
- [Standard 1]: [description with source]
- [Standard 2]: [description with source]

#### Recent Developments
- [Development]: [impact on this document type review]
```

This structured output format applies ONLY when Sara specifies the research is for framework building. For other research tasks (case law, statutory analysis, etc.), use the existing Question Presented / Short Answer / Analysis format.

Keep all other sections intact with junior-framing removed.

**D. Update work-product-standards.md (REVQ-05):**

Update the "Contract Redlines" section to match the new transmittal format from the locked deliverable packaging decisions:

Replace the current transmittal memo structure (Approach, Must-haves, Strong preferences, Nice-to-haves, Open items, Items for discussion) with:

```markdown
### Transmittal Memo

**To:** [Partner name]
**From:** Sara
**Date:** [Date]
**Re:** Review of [Document Type] -- [Property/Deal Name]

#### Deal Summary
2-3 sentences: parties, property, transaction type, purchase price, key dates.

#### Review Scope
- Representation: [Buyer/Seller/etc.]
- Aggressiveness Level: [1-5] -- [brief description of scope at this level]
- Document: [filename], [N] paragraphs, [date of document]
- Coverage: [X] paragraphs reviewed, [Y] revision entries, [Z] accepted, [W] commented
- Focus areas: [top 3-5 areas from analysis framework]

#### Key Changes (Top 5-10)
For each key change:
1. **[Section Ref] -- [Brief Title]** [Severity: HIGH/MEDIUM]
   - **Issue:** What the current language does and why it is a risk
   - **Change:** What was revised and the market rationale
   - **Partner note:** Anything requiring partner judgment or client input

#### Open Items
Organized by contract provision:

##### Due Diligence
| Item | Section | Issue | Severity | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|----------|-------|

##### Representations & Warranties
[...]

##### Default & Remedies
[...]

[Add sections for each provision category with open items]

#### Disposition Table (Appendix)
[Full Section A table from document-reviewer output -- all paragraphs, all columns]
```

Important changes to note:
- **Risk flagging over strategy**: Sara identifies risks and severity but does NOT recommend negotiation strategy (locked decision). Remove "Must-haves", "Strong preferences", "Nice-to-haves" framing which implies negotiation strategy. Replace with "Key Changes" (risk-flagging) and "Open Items" (organized by provision).
- **Open items embedded**: Not a separate file. Embedded in the transmittal memo organized by contract provision.
- **Disposition table as appendix**: The full paragraph disposition table is included so the partner can see exactly what Sara reviewed.

Add delivery format section:
```markdown
### Delivery Format

The transmittal package is delivered as:
1. **.msg file** for MS Outlook (Windows) -- the transmittal memo text is the email body; attachments are the clean docx, redline docx, and disposition table appendix
2. **Markdown summary** in chat -- a brief cover note summarizing what Sara did and what needs partner attention

If the .msg utility is not yet available, Sara prepares all components as separate files and notes the packaging step.

The .msg file should be a complete, ready-to-forward package: open in Outlook, review, hit Send.
```

Update the "Comment bubble standards" to add: "For every comment, include market rationale where applicable."

Update the "Track change standards" to add: "Every revision must have a corresponding entry in the disposition table."

Keep all other sections (Memoranda, Agreements, Correspondence, Briefs, Summaries) intact.
