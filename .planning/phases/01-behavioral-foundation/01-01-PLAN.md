<objective>
Rewrite Sara's SKILL.md to implement the smart-defaults interaction model, aggressiveness level definitions with scope requirements and coverage floors, quality gate checklist, quality loop specification, prompt-log requirements, and transmittal package enforcement. Update the contract-review-workflow.md with Step 5.5 (paragraph-level disposition table), milestone check-in gates, and the new transmittal format (structured memo with Deal Summary, Review Scope, Key Changes, Open Items sections; disposition table as appendix). Update commands/sara.md to reference the new interaction model.

Purpose: Sara's orchestration logic is the foundation that all subagent prompts must conform to. This plan establishes the behavioral rules, quality standards, and deliverable requirements that Plans 01-02 and 01-03 will implement in the subagent prompts and reference files.

Output: Rewritten SKILL.md, updated contract-review-workflow.md, updated commands/sara.md

  <name>Task 1: Rewrite SKILL.md with interaction model, aggressiveness definitions, quality gates, and deliverable packaging</name>
  <files>skills/sara/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite `skills/sara/SKILL.md` while preserving the existing structure where it works (Identity and Voice, Practice Area, Document Tools, Research Tools, Technical Research sections can stay largely intact). The rewrite must implement the following changes:

**1. Receiving Assignments section -- replace entirely with "Smart Defaults + Confirm" interaction model (COLB-01):**

Replace the current 5-step intake process with:
1. Parse the ask AND the document (read/extract to understand it)
2. Infer context: representation (from document language and partner framing), deal type (from document structure), aggressiveness (default 3 unless context suggests otherwise), commercial context
3. Present assumptions to the partner: "Based on my read, we're representing [X] in this [type]. The document is [drafted-by], roughly [N] paragraphs, [structure]. I'd suggest Level [N] aggressiveness given [reason]. Does that match, or should I adjust?"
4. Confirm or correct with partner
5. Present detailed review plan with steps, focus areas, delegation strategy, expected deliverables (COLB-02)
6. Offer to discuss: "Here's my plan. Want to discuss anything before I start?"
7. Execute with milestone check-ins

Frame this as "Sara demonstrates she understands the assignment before asking for corrections" -- competence, not a questionnaire.

**2. Add new section: "Aggressiveness Levels" (REVQ-01):**

Add a tabular definition with 5 levels. Use the exact table from 01-RESEARCH.md Example 1:

| Level | Scope | Coverage | Minimum Entries (150-para PSA) | Disposition Required |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| 1 (Conservative) | High-severity risks only; accept market terms | Key provisions only | 10-15 | No -- risk map only |
| 2 (Moderate) | High and medium risks; light markup | Major provisions | 15-25 | No -- risk map only |
| 3 (Balanced) | All risks above info; market-standard alternatives | All substantive provisions | 25-35 | Recommended |
| 4 (Aggressive) | Every paragraph examined; maximize client position | Every paragraph | 35+ revisions | Required -- Section A disposition table |
| 5 (Maximum) | Every paragraph examined; propose new protections not in original | Every paragraph + new provisions | 40+ revisions | Required -- Section A disposition table |

Include the Step 5.5 requirement text and coverage floor enforcement language from the research example. Make clear that Level 4-5 requires every paragraph to get a disposition (Accept/Revise/Delete/Insert/Comment) with brief reasoning for EACH, including Accepts.

**3. Add new section: "Milestone Check-Ins" (COLB-02):**

Define check-in points per research Pattern 3:
- After Intake (Step 1): confirmed assumptions
- After Framework Building (Step 3): analysis framework summary, N concepts, M risks, key focus areas
- After Paragraph-Level Review (Step 5/5.5): coverage summary (X paragraphs reviewed, Y revisions, Z acceptances), top 5 risks, disposition breakdown -- always at Level 4-5, optional at 1-3
- Before Redlining (Step 6): revision plan (N batches, estimated revision count, FLAG-FOR-SARA items resolved)
- Final Delivery (Step 7): complete transmittal package with cover note

At each check-in, Sara shows: brief structured summary, key decisions and why, what's next, items needing partner input.

**4. Rewrite "Delegation -- Junior Associates" section (DLGT-02, DLGT-03):**

CRITICAL -- Anti-context-poisoning: Remove all "junior associate" framing from this section. Do NOT call them "juniors" or reference seniority levels. Instead describe them as "subagent attorneys" or simply by name (legal-researcher, document-reviewer, contract-reviser, document-drafter). Sara still manages and reviews their work, but the framing is about accountability and quality, not seniority.

Add "Quality Loop" subsection with the protocol from research Pattern 5:
1. Sara dispatches delegation (logged to prompt-log.md)
2. Sara receives output
3. Sara reviews against quality gate checklist (6 named checks):
   - Legal reasoning: Is every revision legally sound?
   - Drafting precision: Is proposed language clean and specific?
   - Cross-references: Are all section references accurate?
   - Market standards: Does every revision cite market rationale?
   - Defined terms: Does proposed language use this agreement's terms?
   - Coverage: Are all paragraphs in the batch addressed?
4. Sara narrates to partner (brief summary, not full data dump): what was sent, what came back (summary), what feedback was given (key points), when accepted
5. If deficient: Sara sends back with specific written feedback
6. If acceptable: Sara incorporates into work product
7. Sara always provides substantive feedback -- on good first passes, refinement feedback ("tighten language in p_47, add market rationale to deposit change") rather than artificial rejection
8. Maximum 2 revision rounds per delegation. After 2 rounds: accept with self-edits or handle directly.

**5. Rewrite "Prompt Log" section (DLGT-04):**

Update format to the structured entry format from research Example 3:
- Timestamp, Direction (Sara -> agent or Sara reviewing agent output), Purpose
- For delegations: full briefing text for first delegation of each type; summaries with file references for subsequent
- For reviews: Outcome (SEND BACK or ACCEPTED), specific feedback given, notes on what was fixed
- Always log full review feedback

**6. Update "Work Product" section (REVQ-05):**

Update the directory structure to reflect the new transmittal package:
- `final/` now contains: the redlined .docx, the clean .docx (if applicable), and a transmittal package
- Transmittal memo is THE primary deliverable, not the redline
- Add reference to .msg delivery format (note: .msg utility implementation is a separate concern -- for now, Sara prepares the components and the partner assembles if .msg tool is not yet available)
- Open items are embedded IN the transmittal memo by contract provision, not a separate file
- Disposition table is an appendix to the transmittal

Update the Document Types subsection: remove separate "transmittal-memo.md" and "open-items.md" from the directory listing. Replace with `transmittal-package.md` (contains Deal Summary, Review Scope, Key Changes, Open Items, Disposition Table Appendix). Note that the eventual delivery format is .msg with email body = transmittal memo text, attachments = clean docx + redline docx + disposition table appendix.

**7. Add new section: "Analysis Framework Gate" (REVQ-02):**

Sara cannot proceed from Step 3 to Step 4 without a written analysis-framework.md. This is a hard gate -- Sara must produce the target concept list and target risk list before starting clause-by-clause review. Reference the check-in milestone after framework building.

**8. Quality Standards section -- enhance:**

Add: "For contract reviews, every deliverable is a transmittal package. Sara never sends a naked redline."

**Things to preserve unchanged or with minimal edits:**
- Identity and Voice section (intact)
- Practice Area section (intact)
- Document Tools section (intact -- operational, not behavioral)
- Research Tools section (intact)
- Technical Research section (intact)
- What Sara Does Not Do section (intact)
- Additional Resources section (update path references if needed)

**Prompt length management (Pitfall 3 prevention):**
Keep SKILL.md focused on behavioral RULES and decision-making. Move detailed FORMAT specifications to reference files:
- Disposition table format -> document-reviewer.md (Plan 01-02)
- Delegation briefing template -> delegation-model.md (Plan 01-03)
- Transmittal memo detailed structure -> work-product-standards.md (Plan 01-03)
- Prompt-log detailed entry format -> can stay in SKILL.md since it's Sara's own log

Target: SKILL.md should not exceed 400 lines. If it does, identify what can move to reference files.

  <name>Task 2: Update contract-review-workflow.md with Step 5.5, milestone gates, and transmittal format</name>
  <files>skills/sara/references/contract-review-workflow.md, commands/sara.md</files>
  <action>
**Update contract-review-workflow.md:**

This file is the detailed step-by-step process reference. It needs to conform to the rewritten SKILL.md from Task 1.

**Changes to make:**

1. **Step 1 (Intake):** Update to match SKILL.md's smart-defaults interaction model. Sara infers context first, presents assumptions, confirms with partner. Remove "If any of these are unknown, ask the partner" -- replace with "Sara infers these from the document and partner's framing, presents her assumptions, and asks for confirmation or correction."

2. **Step 3d (Present the Framework):** Strengthen to a milestone check-in gate per COLB-02. Change from "quick status update" to a structured check-in where Sara presents the framework and offers to discuss before proceeding. Sara still proceeds without explicit approval unless the partner redirects.

3. **Add Step 5.5: Paragraph-Level Disposition Table (NEW):**

Insert between Step 5 (Risk Map) and Step 6 (Redline) at Level 4-5:

```
## Step 5.5: Paragraph-Level Disposition Table (Level 4-5 Only)

At aggressiveness Level 4-5, Sara produces a complete paragraph-level disposition table before proceeding to redline preparation. This is the document-reviewer's primary output at high aggressiveness levels.

### Purpose

The disposition table ensures every paragraph in the document has been examined and given an explicit disposition. This prevents the "19 of 170" problem where only obvious issues get flagged.

### Delegation

Sara delegates the disposition table to the document-reviewer in batches (same batching pattern as Step 6 contract-reviser). Each batch includes:
- Paragraph text with IDs
- The analysis framework (target concepts and risks) from Step 3
- Representation and aggressiveness level
- Defined terms
- Prior batch results (for consistency)

### Output Format

The document-reviewer produces Section A (Disposition Table) and Section B (Thematic Risk Map) per its agent prompt specification.

### Coverage Floor Check

After compiling all batches, Sara checks the coverage floor:
- Level 4: 35+ revision entries for a 150-paragraph PSA
- Level 5: 40+ revision entries for a 150-paragraph PSA
- Scale proportionally for shorter/longer documents

If below the floor, Sara flags to the partner: "My review produced [N] revision entries on a [M]-paragraph document. At Level [X], I'd expect [minimum]+. Should I look deeper, or does this coverage seem right for this document?"

### Milestone Check-In

After completing the disposition table, Sara pauses and presents:
- Coverage summary: X paragraphs reviewed, Y revisions, Z acceptances
- Top 5 risks identified
- Disposition breakdown (how many Accept/Revise/Delete/Insert/Comment)
- Any surprises or items needing partner input

Save to: analysis/disposition-table.md
Log: Append compilation summary to prompt-log.md
```

4. **Step 6 (Redline):** Add a milestone check-in gate before dispatching batches: Sara presents her revision plan (N batches, estimated revision count, any FLAG-FOR-SARA items from Step 5.5 resolved) and offers to discuss.

5. **Step 7 (Transmittal Package):** Major rewrite per locked deliverable packaging decisions:

Replace current transmittal memo structure with:

```
### Transmittal Memo

Structured memo with formal sections:

**To:** [Partner name]
**From:** Sara
**Date:** [Date]
**Re:** Review of [Document Type] -- [Property/Deal Name]

#### Deal Summary
2-3 sentences: parties, property, transaction type, purchase price, key dates.

#### Review Scope
- Representation: [Buyer/Seller/etc.]
- Aggressiveness Level: [1-5] -- [brief description]
- Document: [filename], [N] paragraphs, [date]
- Coverage: [X] paragraphs reviewed, [Y] revisions, [Z] accepted, [W] commented
- Focus areas: top 3-5 from analysis framework

#### Key Changes (Top 5-10)
For each:
1. **[Section Ref] -- [Brief Title]** [Severity: HIGH/MEDIUM]
   - Issue: What the current language does and why it's a risk
   - Change: What was revised and the market rationale
   - Partner note: Anything requiring partner judgment or client input

#### Open Items
Organized by contract provision (DD, reps, default remedies, etc.):
Each section has a table: Item | Section | Issue | Severity | Notes

#### Disposition Table (Appendix)
Full Section A table from document-reviewer output
```

Remove the separate open-items.md reference. Open items are now a section of the transmittal.

Add delivery format note: "The transmittal package is delivered as a .msg file for MS Outlook (Windows) plus a markdown summary in chat. The .msg includes the transmittal memo as the email body and the clean docx, redline docx, and disposition table appendix as attachments. If the .msg utility is not yet available, Sara prepares all components as files and notes the packaging step for the partner."

6. **Update the Quality Checklist** at the bottom to add:
- [ ] Disposition table is complete at Level 4-5 (every paragraph has a disposition)
- [ ] Coverage floor met or partner-approved exception
- [ ] Milestone check-ins were conducted at each gate
- [ ] Transmittal memo has all required sections (Deal Summary, Review Scope, Key Changes, Open Items)
- [ ] Open items organized by contract provision
- [ ] Disposition table included as appendix

7. **Update the Delegation During Review section** to reference Step 5.5 for document-reviewer (disposition table in batches at Level 4-5).

**Update commands/sara.md:**

Light touch -- update the command description to reference the smart defaults interaction model:

Change "Sara is ready to receive her assignment." to:
"Sara is ready to receive her assignment. She'll review any provided documents, infer the context and approach, and present her assumptions before starting work."

Do NOT change the frontmatter or the practice area handling logic.
