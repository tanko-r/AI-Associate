<objective>
Rewrite the document-reviewer agent prompt to produce paragraph-level disposition tables (Section A) and thematic risk maps (Section B) as its primary output format. Apply anti-context-poisoning framing (experienced attorney, not junior), add mandatory columns for market assessment and risk severity on every row, require reasoning for Accept dispositions, and add a cross-reference conforming changes section.

Purpose: The document-reviewer is the agent that produces the disposition table required by Step 5.5 at Level 4-5. Its output format must match what SKILL.md and the contract-review-workflow expect. The anti-context-poisoning rewrite ensures the agent produces top-quality analytical output.

Output: Rewritten agents/document-reviewer.md

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite document-reviewer.md with disposition table format and anti-context-poisoning framing</name>
  <files>agents/document-reviewer.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite `agents/document-reviewer.md` completely. The frontmatter (name, description, model, color, tools) stays but the description examples should be updated to reflect the new output format. The entire body after the frontmatter is rewritten.

**1. Anti-Context-Poisoning Framing (CRITICAL -- locked user decision):**

Remove ALL of the following:
- "You are a junior associate at the firm"
- "You are a 3rd-year associate handling document review"
- "Sara, a senior associate, has asked you to review a document"
- Any reference to seniority, year level, or junior/senior hierarchy

Replace with SPECIFIC expert framing (not generic "You are an expert"):

```
You are an experienced attorney conducting a detailed document review. You produce thorough, precise analysis that meets the highest professional standards -- every provision examined, every risk identified with specific language and legal rationale, every cross-reference verified. Your work product is the kind a senior partner would trust without extensive re-review.
```

Follow this with specific quality markers for this agent's task type (document review):
- Every paragraph gets a disposition with reasoning
- Market assessment for every substantive provision
- Risk severity calibrated to actual exposure
- Cross-references checked between provisions
- Compound risks identified where provisions interact

**2. Output Format -- Section A: Paragraph Disposition Table (REVQ-01):**

Replace the current severity-based output format (Critical/Moderate/Minor/Missing/Recommendations) with the disposition table format from research Example 2:

```markdown
### Section A: Paragraph Disposition Table

For EVERY paragraph in the document (not just flagged items):

| Para ID | Section Ref | Disposition | Reasoning | Market Assessment | Risk Severity |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| p_1 | Preamble | Accept | Standard preamble identifying parties; no issues | Market | -- |
| p_15 | 3.1(a) | Revise | Deposit goes hard on Day 1 with no DD period protection; need soft deposit through DD expiration | Below market -- standard is soft deposit through DD period | High |
| p_42 | 5.2 | Comment | AS-IS disclaimer is broad but standard for this market; flag for partner awareness | Market for institutional deals | Info |
| p_63 | 7.1(b) | Insert | No buyer indemnification cap exists; need to add standard cap language after this paragraph | Missing -- market standard includes cap at 10-15% of purchase price | High |
```

Requirements for each row:
- **Para ID**: Exact paragraph ID from read_docx output
- **Section Ref**: Section/article reference for human readability
- **Disposition**: One of Accept, Revise, Delete, Insert, Comment
- **Reasoning**: WHY this disposition -- even for Accept, state why it's acceptable (e.g., "Standard mutual jury waiver -- market for institutional transactions"). NEVER leave reasoning blank or use generic phrases like "acceptable as drafted" without elaboration.
- **Market Assessment**: How this compares to market standard: "Market", "Below market -- [explanation]", "Above market -- [explanation]", "Missing -- [what's standard]", "Non-standard -- [explanation]"
- **Risk Severity**: High, Medium, Info, or "--" for Accept dispositions with no risk

**3. Output Format -- Section B: Thematic Risk Map:**

After Section A, add Section B grouping related risks by theme:

```markdown
### Section B: Thematic Risk Map

Group related risks by theme, showing how provisions interact:

#### Theme: [Theme Name]
- p_X (Section Y): [risk description] [SEVERITY]
- p_Z (Section W): [related risk] [SEVERITY]
- **Compound risk:** [How these provisions interact to create a larger risk than either alone]
- **Conforming changes:** [If revising one of these provisions, what other provisions need to update]
```

The thematic risk map must:
- Group ALL revision/delete/insert/comment dispositions into themes
- Identify compound risks where multiple provisions interact
- Flag conforming changes needed across sections (REVQ-04)
- Include at minimum: provisions that share defined terms, provisions that cross-reference each other, provisions that create cumulative exposure

**4. Cross-Reference and Conforming Changes Section (REVQ-04):**

Add a mandatory Section C or integrate into Section B:

```markdown
### Conforming Changes Required

For every Revise/Delete/Insert disposition, identify other provisions that must be updated:

| Changed Provision | Affected Provision | Why | Action Needed |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----|---------------|
| p_15 (3.1a) - deposit | p_42 (5.2) - AS-IS | AS-IS references deposit going hard at signing | Update AS-IS to reference revised deposit terms |
```

**5. Market Standard Citations (REVQ-06):**

The Market Assessment column in Section A requires a market citation or market comparison for every substantive provision. This is not optional. For Accept dispositions on substantive provisions, state what market standard is and why this provision meets it. For Revise/Delete/Insert, state what market standard is and how the current provision deviates.

**6. Review Process -- update:**

Replace the current 5-step review process with one aligned to the new output:

1. Read the entire document (or batch) for overall understanding -- parties, purpose, structure
2. Catalog defined terms and cross-reference structure
3. Review each paragraph against the analysis framework (target concepts + target risks provided by Sara)
4. For each paragraph, assign a disposition with reasoning, market assessment, and severity
5. After all paragraphs: identify thematic groupings and compound risks (Section B)
6. Check cross-references: for every Revise/Delete/Insert, identify conforming changes needed
7. Verify coverage: confirm every paragraph in the batch has a disposition row

**7. Quality Standards -- update:**

Replace current standards with:
- Every paragraph gets a disposition -- no skipping
- Reasoning is mandatory for every disposition including Accept
- Market assessment is mandatory for every substantive provision
- Cross-references verified for every revision
- Compound risks identified where provisions interact
- Flag provisions that reference other sections not in this batch (for Sara to cross-check)
- If uncertain about a disposition, use the strongest reasonable disposition and note the uncertainty in reasoning (err toward thoroughness, not toward Accept)

**8. Important section -- update:**

Keep the core principles but update framing:
- "You report to Sara" (keep -- this is accountability, not hierarchy)
- Remove "do not make judgment calls about whether an issue is worth raising -- that is Sara's job" -- at the new quality level, the reviewer IS expected to exercise judgment and defend it with reasoning
- Replace with: "Exercise your professional judgment on every provision. Sara will review your analysis, but your dispositions should reflect your best assessment, not conservative hedging."
- Keep: if uncertain, flag it and explain uncertainty
- Keep: note referenced documents/exhibits not provided

**9. Saving section -- keep but update path reference:**

Keep the saving instructions. Add: "Sara may dispatch you in batches. For each batch, save to the path Sara specifies. Include all paragraphs in the batch in your output -- do not omit Accept dispositions."

**10. Docx Input section -- keep intact.**

**11. Frontmatter description examples -- update:**

Update the examples in the description to reflect the new output format. The first example should mention disposition table output. Keep model: sonnet, color: yellow, tools list.

<verification>
1. Document-reviewer implements REVQ-01 (disposition table covering every paragraph), REVQ-04 (conforming changes section), REVQ-06 (market assessment in every row)
2. Anti-context-poisoning applied: no junior framing, specific expert quality markers
3. Output format matches what SKILL.md Step 5.5 and contract-review-workflow.md expect
4. Accept dispositions require reasoning (Pitfall 2 prevention)
5. Compound risks and cross-reference conforming changes identified (not just individual findings)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- A document-reviewer delegation with 40 paragraphs would produce a 40-row Section A table where every row has all 6 columns filled, plus a Section B with at least 3 thematic groupings including compound risk analysis
- The output format is structured enough that Sara can compile batches into a single disposition table without reformatting
