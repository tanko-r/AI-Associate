<objective>
Define the title objection letter and title summary memo workflow in deal-workflows.md and add corresponding quality standards to work-product-standards.md.

Purpose: Enables Sara to review a title commitment, categorize Schedule B-II exceptions using a three-bucket system (Accept/Object/Review), draft a title objection letter specifying cure actions for objections, and produce a companion title summary memo for the client.

Output: Completed Workflow 2 in deal-workflows.md (replacing the stub from 03-01), fleshed-out title objection letter and title summary memo sections in work-product-standards.md.

Replace the Workflow 2 stub in deal-workflows.md with a complete behavioral specification. Follow the same level of detail and tone as Workflow 1 (closing checklist). The workflow must implement all locked decisions from the phase context.

**Workflow 2: Title Objection Letter from Title Commitment**

### Purpose
Review a title commitment, categorize Schedule B-II exceptions, and produce (a) a title objection letter specifying cure actions for objections and (b) a client-facing title summary memo.

### Input
- Title commitment (required)
- PSA (optional -- for cross-reference, objection deadline extraction, permitted exceptions definition)
- Survey (optional -- for cross-reference with survey exceptions)
- Other documents (optional -- Sara uses whatever is provided)
- Letter template .docx (optional -- for style matching)
- SARA.md (if it exists from prior workflows)

### Output
- Title objection letter .docx (template-driven if template provided)
- Title summary memo .docx (separate file)
- Updated SARA.md

### Steps

#### Step 1: Read Title Commitment and Extract Key Information
1. Read SARA.md if it exists (reuse deal context from prior workflows)
2. Read title commitment using read_docx
3. Extract:
   - Title company and commitment number
   - Proposed insured (buyer entity)
   - Policy type (owner's or lender's) and proposed insured amount
   - Vesting (how title will be held)
   - Effective date of commitment
   - Schedule A: property description, proposed coverage amount
   - Schedule B-I: requirements to be satisfied before closing (list each requirement)
   - Schedule B-II: exceptions to coverage (list each exception with its number)
   - Any special endorsements offered or required
4. If PSA available: extract title objection deadline, permitted exceptions definition, and any title-related provisions
5. If survey available: note survey-related exceptions for cross-reference

#### Step 2: Categorize Exceptions (Accept / Object / Review)
For each Schedule B-II exception, assign one of three categories:

**Accept** -- Exception is standard/boilerplate or acceptable for this transaction:
- Standard printed exceptions (rights of parties in possession, survey matters, mechanic's liens, taxes not yet due)
- Utility easements that do not materially affect the property
- Restrictions/covenants that run with the land and are customary
- Exceptions that match PSA-defined "permitted exceptions" (if PSA provided)

**Object** -- Exception requires curative action before closing:
- Open mortgages or deeds of trust
- Judgment liens, tax liens, mechanic's liens (filed)
- Encroachments or boundary disputes
- Easements that materially affect intended use
- Any exception that would not be acceptable to a reasonable buyer
- For each objection: specify the EXACT cure action required (e.g., "Release this mortgage of record," "Obtain subordination agreement from [lienholder]," "Record satisfaction of judgment")

**Review** -- Exception needs partner attention before categorization:
- Exceptions Sara cannot fully analyze from available documents alone
- Exceptions involving complex title issues (adverse possession claims, boundary line agreements, unrecorded interests)
- Exceptions where the cure action depends on business decisions the partner must make
- Include Sara's preliminary analysis and recommendation for each Review item

**Quality check:** Every Schedule B-II exception must have a category. If Sara has categorized all exceptions as Accept, she has likely been too permissive -- go back and examine each non-standard exception critically. If she has categorized all as Object, she may be over-objecting -- standard exceptions should be accepted.

Cross-reference with PSA and survey when available:
- Compare exceptions to PSA's "permitted exceptions" definition
- Compare survey exceptions to the survey itself (if provided)
- Note any discrepancies between the title commitment and other documents

#### Step 3: Milestone Check-in (Exception Categorization Review)
Present the categorized exceptions to the partner:
> "I've reviewed the title commitment ([title company], Commitment No. [number]). Schedule B-II has [N] exceptions: [X] accepted, [Y] objected, [Z] flagged for your review. Here's the breakdown -- any adjustments before I draft the letter?"

Include a summary table:
| # | Exception | Category | Cure Action / Notes |
|---|-----------|----------|---------------------|

Wait for confirmation or corrections. Apply any corrections to the categorization.

#### Step 4: Generate Title Objection Letter and Summary Memo

**Title Objection Letter (.docx):**
- If template provided: use write_docx with template_path for style matching
- Formal letter format (see work-product-standards.md for letter standards)
- Addressed to seller (or seller's counsel per PSA)
- Reference: PSA date, parties, property, title commitment number
- State the objection deadline (from PSA if available, otherwise note as [OBJECTION DEADLINE])
- For each objected exception:
  - Identify the exception by Schedule B-II number and description
  - State the specific cure action required
  - State the deadline for cure (typically closing or an earlier date per PSA)
- For accepted exceptions: brief statement that buyer accepts the remaining exceptions as permitted exceptions (do not list each one individually in the letter)
- For Review exceptions: these do NOT appear in the letter (they are in the memo for partner review first)
- Close with standard reservation of rights language

**Title Summary Memo (.docx):**
- Client-facing memo format (see work-product-standards.md)
- Header: To (partner/client), From (Sara), Date, Re (Title Review -- [Property])
- Sections:
  1. **Commitment Overview:** Title company, commitment number, insured amount, policy type, vesting, effective date
  2. **Schedule B-I Requirements:** List each requirement and its status (satisfied/pending/to be satisfied at closing)
  3. **Exception Analysis:** All Schedule B-II exceptions with Accept/Object/Review categorization
     - For each exception: number, description, category, cure action (if Object), notes
     - Standard/boilerplate exceptions discussed briefly (what they are, why they are standard)
     - Objected exceptions with detailed analysis of the issue and cure required
     - Review exceptions with Sara's preliminary analysis and recommendation
  4. **Cross-Reference Notes:** Discrepancies between title commitment, PSA, and survey (if applicable)
  5. **Recommendations:** Prioritized action items for the partner

**File naming:** objection-letter-[property-shortname].docx, title-memo-[property-shortname].docx

#### Step 5: Update SARA.md
- Update Deal Summary with title commitment details (if not already present)
- Append to Work Product Log: date, "Title Objection Letter + Summary Memo", output file names, exception counts (X accepted, Y objected, Z review)
- Append to Issues Flagged: any title issues that could affect the deal

  </files>
  <action>
Replace the title objection letter and title summary memo stub sections in work-product-standards.md (added by 03-01) with complete quality standards. Follow the same level of detail as the existing "Contract Redlines" and "Memoranda" sections.

**Title Objection Letter section:**

Structure:
1. [FIRM LETTERHEAD] placeholder
2. Date and addressee (seller or seller's counsel)
3. Re line: reference to PSA, property, title commitment number
4. Opening: state buyer's review of the title commitment and basis for objections
5. Objection deadline reference (from PSA or [OBJECTION DEADLINE] placeholder)
6. Numbered objections: each with Schedule B-II exception number, description, and specific cure action
7. Acceptance statement: brief statement that remaining exceptions are accepted as permitted exceptions
8. Reservation of rights: standard language reserving right to object to subsequent exceptions
9. Signature block: partner name (Sara notes who should sign)

Standards:
- Every objection must specify the exact cure action (e.g., "Release this deed of trust," not "Remove this encumbrance")
- Reference exception by Schedule B-II number for precision
- Set cure deadline (typically closing date or earlier per PSA)
- Formal letter tone -- this is correspondence with opposing counsel
- Do not include Review items -- those need partner decision first
- Do not include detailed analysis of accepted exceptions (that goes in the memo)
- Match template style if template provided

**Title Summary Memo section:**

Structure:
1. Header block: To, From (Sara), Date, Re
2. Commitment Overview: title company, number, insured amount, policy type, vesting, effective date
3. Schedule B-I Requirements: list with status
4. Exception Analysis: all exceptions with categorization
5. Cross-Reference Notes: discrepancies with PSA/survey
6. Recommendations: prioritized action items

Standards:
- Write for a sophisticated businessperson or partner reviewing title
- Every exception gets a row -- Accept, Object, and Review all discussed
- Standard exceptions discussed briefly (what they are, why standard) -- not skipped
- Object items include detailed analysis matching the letter's objections
- Review items include Sara's preliminary analysis and recommendation
- Cross-reference notes identify any inconsistency between title commitment and other deal documents
- Recommendations are specific and actionable: "Obtain release of [mortgage]" not "Address title issues"
