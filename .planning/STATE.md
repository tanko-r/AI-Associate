# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-17)

**Core value:** Sara's work product must be thorough enough that a partner would approve it with light review — every clause examined, every risk flagged with specific alternative language, every deliverable complete.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Behavioral Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Behavioral Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-roadmap]: Quality before infrastructure — RAG is v2; behavioral overhaul is v1
- [Pre-roadmap]: Existing docx tooling is adequate — problem is Sara's brain, not her hands
- [Pre-roadmap]: Both reference materials + LLM knowledge — checklists/clause libraries for structure, LLM for reasoning
- [2026-02-18 roadmap revision]: Phase 2 ships stubs, not fully authored content — user populates substantive legal content in re-checklist-psa.md, clause-library.md, and market-standards.md over time; Sara loads whatever is present
- [2026-02-18 roadmap revision]: Phase 3 expanded to include closing document drafting (deeds, assignments, estoppels, holdbacks) — DEAL-03 added to requirements

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Stub files must be wired into Sara's Step 3 load sequence — even partially-filled stubs should improve Sara's framework; validate that Sara degrades gracefully when placeholders are unfilled
- [Phase 1]: Aggressiveness level coverage thresholds (35+ entries at Level 4, 40+ at Level 5 for 150-paragraph PSA) are analytical estimates, not empirically validated — calibrate against real reviews after Phase 1 ships
- [Phase 3]: Closing document templates (deed, assignment, estoppel) will need jurisdiction-specific review before Sara uses them in production — flag in the cover note Sara generates and note in plan that templates are starting points requiring partner validation
