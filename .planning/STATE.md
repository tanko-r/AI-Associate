## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Coverage floor calibration (35+ at L4, 40+ at L5) needs empirical validation against real reviews
- Closing document templates may need jurisdiction-specific forms (marked Revisit in PROJECT.md)
- 4 human verification items from Phase 1 require live test sessions
